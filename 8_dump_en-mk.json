Matches like this one are an excellent opportunity for gaining experience and one becomes a true great player exactly on these matches.\" We have both good and bad times; you have written good things, but critics as well. We will fight and I hope that we will have the support from the audience; we will play, so what will be, will be. They play sharp defense, so our players will have a difficult task, no matter what type of defense they are going to play, either 5:1 or 6:0. Cervar also talked about the future of HC Metalurg and about his role in it: \"If the club works with full speed and stands on solid ground, then I will like to be part of it, to pass my knowledge to these young players and to help the handball in Macedonia to get new players. We, the professional staff and the management board and together with the players who have stayed, have focused our aim and want to finish well the rest of the matches. Lino Cervar: \"We have come to our last match in the Velux EHF Champions League. This is a big experience for them, which is a very important thing for me.\" We did not imagine that things will go this way, but this is the reality and now we are facing a new challenge. My life has always been a fight and I will always fight for the victory. This is a team which will grow through the victories and the losses.\" I respect Vujovic as a coach. I thank all the present representatives of the written and the electronic media for their cooperation. Cervar talked about the rivalry with Veselin Vujovic, HC PPD Zagreb's coach: \"In my career, I have always had respect for the other coaches. HC PPD Zagreb is an opponent that is well covered on each position. HC PPD Zagreb has got a bigger choice of players, so this will be a difficult match for our young players. I think that we are doing a good job. I respect that, as I respect every critic. I always fight, although now we are not in a good position. Levce Kitevski: \"We have come to the end of the Velux EHF Champions League. Filip Taleski: \"HC PPD Zagreb is a big challenge for us. These players are very young and they were playing against RK Radovis and RK Prilep until yesterday, but now they are part of this competition and it is not easy for them. I thank our loyal audience that has been with us during the critical times and I use this opportunity to invite all our fans to come on Sunday and to support our young players.\" They have good goalkeeper, a good back line, and fast wings that can punish each mistake. I will be happy if they become the new force in the Macedonian handball. Vujo was my rival while he was working in Macedonia. I hope that our cooperation will continue, because HC Metalurg has turned a new page and survived the crisis. We are happy that we have a coach like Lino Cervar and I know that a lot of players would like to be in our place. The matches between HC Vardar and HC Metalurg were the biggest derby-matches not just on the Balkans, but also in Southeast Europe. Lino Cervar, the chief of the professional staff, Levce Kitevski, the president of the club, and Filip Taleski, on behalf of the players, were leading the press conference. Our team will have a lot of victories and losses, but it is certain that it will become better, the young players will gather experience and one day this will be a great team again. Our owner really wants to put back HC Metalurg where it belongs and I think that we will achieve this next year. Now, we have practically a combination of the cadet and the junior team. It is not easy for them, but if they are working hard, show ambition and fighting and team spirit, then we will have a new successful generation.\" Of course, this squad is completely different from the one that started the season.

Then, the princess, without being afraid of the handsome creature, approached it and began to caress it, to pat it; then holding her bouquet of flowers she hopped its back; and immediately caught its gilded horns. Zeus conveyed Europa on the island of Crete; in the famous Dikteon Cave. In order to perpetuate this love with the Princess Europa Zeus ordered the Cretan maple trees never to lose their leaves. This God fell in love with the Princess Europa passionately In order to get close to her, he decided to disguise as a bull with white, bright and dazzling beauty, scented with a pink and saffron cologne. The bull immediately as a lightning came down with an unseen and unheard of speed in the water; with the prey on its back and parted away from the coast of Phoenicia. Today, one of the continents of the world, where Crete itself is positioned; is named after his favorite and beloved princess Europe. That is the reason that today, the largest satellite on the planet Jupiter bears the name of Europe. While collecting flowers and weaving a wreath she caught the attention of the almighty Zeus, known in mythology as father of the Gods. In this action he was accompanied by his brother Poseidon, Amphitrite, the goddess of the seas and Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty and love. The Romans borrowed this myth too, where the supreme god is Jupiter.",

Every place where young people are going to party is going to attract drug dealers who know they can move a lot of merchandise. It would be smart for you to get familiar with these drugs. If your child is going to go on a Senior Trip or Spring Break vacation, this is one of the most vital times to have a conversation about drug abuse. A Comment About Spring Breaks\/Senior Trips Venues that market their parties to Spring Breakers also encourage heavy drinking through their advertising and pricing schemes. If possible, you should begin educating your child or children on the hazards of using these drugs before the child enters their teenaged years. The more knowledge you have, the more you can impart this knowledge to your children, other family members, friends and neighbours. Preventing problems during Senior Trips or Spring Break trips should start long before the subject of your child taking this trip comes up. If you would like more information on them, here are some websites from government agencies or Narconon that you can visit. Your child staying sober when others around him are getting drunk or stoned could wind up saving not only his life but the lives of others nearby. But if you are starting late, start anyway! You might invite him to look at alternative ways he (or she) could enter into the spirit of the party without being stoned or high. Club drugs, synthetics, cocaine and marijuana are probably going to be available in volume. It seldom works to just tell a child that he must not use any drugs.

Author: Bogdan Kolev Preventive measures involve measures and activities of state and other institutions and bodies towards prevention of negative social occurrences as well as the related consequences. The basic factors determining traffic safety are the human being, the vehicle and the roads, hence the measures for preventive actions must be aimed towards these three. Users Bearing in mind the primary function of the police, which is protection and respect of human rights and freedoms, and simultaneously prevention and tracing punishable crimes, as well as prosecution of perpetrators, there exists a \"slippery terrain\" and consequently frequent dilemmas among drug users on the limitations of police authorizations and possible overstepping of these. By researching marginalized communities and their encounters with the law, sociologists and cultural anthropologists take the risk of being perceived as undercover police informants by their subjects of research, while by the authorities, on the otherhand, as co-conspirators in the criminal offences depicted, particularly when they refuse to reveal the identity of their respondents. According to the latest research in Canada and several US states (Colorado and Oregon), there has been a decrease in cannabis use among the young population, somewhere as low as a 50% drop. The act of cannabis legalization itself leads to specific shifts. The police maintains the public peace and order, dealing with people who exhibit indecent or violent behaviours, with traffic accidents, firearm violence, all the while constantly exposed to huge threats to their lives. Police officers also must stop and rigorously prevent any violations of the law and international standards by other police officers.",

What we bring as a decision, the media are here to publish, what we initiate, they are here to ask, to follow up how far along the procedure is. All of our sessions are transparent, it publishes its decisions publicly and transparently on its website \u2013 everything it does is public\", said Ivanovska at the beginning of her speech, pointing out that the new law has also given them the possibility, should they have pressures, to turn to the Parliament, which is especially important as a tool for achieving transparency and independence, but also as a form of public pressure. First of all, every one of us needs to be clear in the fight within ourselves, first not to pay for a service that we are entitled to, and not to demand a bribe for what we are doing. With that procedure (for whistle-blowers) they receive full protection from the state. Biljana Ivanovska, President of the State Commission for Prevention of Corruption and Conflict of Interests, as one of the speakers at CIVIL's seminar \"Transparency and responsibility in the political processes\", defined the fundamental obligations, but also the expectations from the SCPC, as well as the need for cooperation with the civil sector, the media, institutions, and, of course, with every citizens individually. These are our first modest beginnings in the cooperation with the civil sector, but every success is due to the beginning.\t\u041e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0446\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0453\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0458 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0445 \u0441\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a. I am not a lawyer, but I have a strong sense of justice and fairness, and that is why I will fight. The fight is in us, it just needs to surface. You are putting that as a strategic goal, on the one hand, it is humiliating to say that you do not have the money. Corruption violates the rule of law, it violates human rights, moral values.\t\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0448\u0438 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e, \u0433\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0448\u0438 \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430, \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. That should be something that is shameful to do. They are not allowed to even identify them. It's very difficult from that aspect\", Ivanovska explained the structure and financing of the SCPC, in the concluding part of her speech, after which there was a two-hour discussion on the topic corruption, and how to combat it. People are literally dissatisfied with this country, the anger is felt in the text, the way the complaint is written. I think that together we will succeed to arrive to results! Furthermore, transparency of the Commission has increased because of civil society organizations. No one has been left without a reply. Because we were abused, political parties quarrelled through us with complaints. That is why we will be more among the citizens, in the institutions, to tell people not to sell themselves, real human destinies are being traded\", stated Ivanovska, referring to education of citizens and their effort to be more among them and in their service, to continuously strengthen citizens' awareness, to encourage them that they don't owe anyone anything. The first significant change made under the pressure of citizen associations is the manner of electing the Commission, as a first factor that enables non-political, decisive and non-selective action. The budget has been made according to the previous year, when the commission wasn't functioning. Now it has two pages of competencies. If we are a critical mass, from here on we will continue to do and behave as such, to build a healthy tissue\", stressed Ivanovska. That is a big step\", says Ivanovska, urging for citizens not to be afraid, and that the SCPC has taken the obligation to encourage them not to keep silent in the face of injustice. This means that we will lose half a year until we get that software. We changed the rules of procedure in order not to put all such complaints in a session, but to check them, whether they are grounded or not, and to put the decisions in a session. Much information is being sent to us and many people have responded, for which we are truly pleased.\t\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u045c\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043b\u0443\u0453\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0430, \u0448\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438 \u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e. Something that everyone can do in strengthening citizens' awareness. Ivanovska, SCPC, on transparency and responsibility in the fight against corruption (part 1) When it will be condemned as something shameful, then we will have a fight against corruption. Thanks to the participation of the civil society, significant changes have been made in the laws, including the Law on Prevention of Corruption. In these six months, we now already have 12 cases, some in the final phase. Through specific examples, openly, transparently and responsibly, Ivanovska brought the most important institution in the fight against corruption closer to the citizens. , Ivanovska was categorical.\t, \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0435 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430.",

All cafes, restaurants, bars and betting shops are closed, leaving people with limited options for socializing. Friends are at home with their families, and all places where people could channel their aggression are closed. It is a well-known fact that one of the main triggers of domestic violence is the need to exert power and control over others. The state of emergency may not necessarily lead to an increase in the number of domestic violence cases (although it is not unlikely), but it will certainly lead to an increase in the intensity of the violence in the marriages and partnerships where it is already present.

        "text":"Abdulov: Election promises made to the socially... These promises cannot be and must not be populistic, and we are aware, or have witnessed so far in campaigns, and in the period following elections, that governments composed of various political parties, use these moments of solving poverty, or the problems of the marginalized groups of citizens. This means sitting at a joint table, setting priorities, setting goals that are realistic, and setting a time frame. Also, it is a serious problem for the political parties. CIVIL Media: What can and what should the institutions, political parties, unions and civil society do in order to prevent the abuse of socially disadvantaged categories, and overall the topics in the area of social justice in the political and electoral context? These promises must not be in the form of \u2013 one solution for all. The promises that are largely described by political parties during the pre-election period, can lead to a situation in which the citizens themselves, or the those voting for the political parties, start to lose trust in those political parties, and end up staying home at the next election cycle. Some of the problems will not be solved in the first four years of the formation of a given government. That is, if we assume that the next parliamentary elections, or local elections would take place once in every four years. Therefore, promises need to be more comprehensive, that is, for all. Not everything is about the promises, not everything is about the housing issue, about the issue of addressing poverty... ZIVKOVIC: What I am about to say may sound a little strange, but it is good to use the marginalized and disadvantaged groups of citizens in election campaigns and in pre-election activities. Therefore, if such a strategy is established, then there will absolutely be no problem in terms of the abuse of these groups of citizens in pre-election periods. For these reasons, if we look at social justice of the all the citizens in Republic of Macedonia, then we need to create a concrete strategy. We have a saying - 'every wonder lasts three days'.\t\u0418\u043c\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430\u0448\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438 '\u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430'. Zivkovic: The abuse of disadvantaged and marginalized citizens is a serious problem! Political parties promise wonders and, unfortunately, that is how many days those wonders last. This entire period should include all the above-mentioned groups. The fact that in many cases political parties do not refer to the solutions offered by experts, or civil society organizations, does really present a problem. We cannot separate certain groups of citizens as more important ones or of higher priority\", says expert on workers' rights, Milan Zivkovic, from the Friedrich Ebert Foundation Office in Skopje, in an interview for CIVIL Media. The consequences in terms of the social measures in this category of citizens are definitely, not setting priorities in solving the problems. Also, these cannot be promises, which in the shortest period following the elections, will solve all the issues and problems of the disadvantaged and marginalized groups of citizens. This means that this is a serious problem for the citizens, a serious problem for the voters. And I will say once more, social justice for all. Nevertheless, if we assume that we do have elections every four years, then the process of creating these policies, or finding solutions, should last four years. They do this in such a bombastic way that we get this perception, through the media, that we no longer have problems with poverty, with the homeless, we have no problem with respecting diversity... It is not only the state institutions that need to solve certain issues and problems of certain groups of citizens, but rather, all actors need to be involved. They are issues that need to start being considered from the very first day after the elections, and until the next elections. We have to say that so far, we have not seen a single campaign that has been fulfilled from word to word, in the period following the elections. But still, we cannot blame them if they have lost their trust in the political parties giving these promises. There is nothing worse than for the voters to stay home and not use their voting right, the constitutional right to vote for any party. We need to see things as a complete solution, that is, create a strategy which would fulfill that social justice. Imagine just how positive it would be if we had campaigns focusing on social justice. Perhaps some issues and problems will not be able to be solved even in the next eight years, but, that is why a strategy should be developed for the implementation of social justice for all, in which everyone will give equal contribution. Though, the fact is that we do have a problem with all that. ZIVKOVIC: We have a saying \u2013 \"every wonder lasts three days\". Also, civil society organizations, experts, unions, state institutions and all external experts who can give their contribution to solving the problems of the marginalized groups of citizens. How often does this happen? The fact that most of the requests, more specifically, promises of the political parties in the pre-election period, remain unanswered and unfulfilled, points out that it everything comes down to an abuse. These solutions are not always the optimum ones, which these disadvantaged or marginalized groups need. The parties go with their own analysis that have been developed in one way or another, and at the end, they come to a solution that they believe is good to use, or to solve the problems of these groups of citizens. The non-fulfillment of pre-election promises indicates that it is in fact an abuse. Social justice as a base for a political campaign, of any political party in Macedonia, focusing on all these issues concerning the disadvantaged and marginalized groups of citizens.",

Our very existence and our whole life is a gift of God, let alone the graceful opportunity that we receive in the Church for graceful existence (good being) now as well as for the eternal graceful existence. Thus, all of this is related to all of us (especially to those who are placed in high positions in any area of the life of the society), if we forgive and if we show mercy, with concrete help, to those who suffer mentally and physically, only from our surplus \u2013 from everything spiritually and materially, which God Has granted us, we will be praised by the Lord of our lives, that is, after we become extremely impoverished by life, we will be accepted into eternal dwellings. This entry was posted by Macedon on Friday, December 4th, 2020 at 12:00 and is filed under \u0411ece\u0434\u0438. The unrighteous servant usually remembers at the end of his life that everything is vanity and nothingness before the inevitable and unspeakable meeting with the Living God, on the other hand little Mary at the beginning of Her life burned Herself out in the Holy of Holies, longing for a personal encounter with the One Who IS \u2013 the Ever-Essential One, so She may ever glow to us all forever, as a Lighthouse of the uncreated light, which leads and saves us through the stormy sea of this life, to the safe harbour of the Father\u2019s embrace, through Christ in the Holy Spirit. Well, now, if we invest (spend) ourselves with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our soul and with all our strength in the work of God, and if we burn out (spend) ourselves in that giving, for the salvation of man and the world, then our Heavenly Father will be looking at us differently and He will address us with different words, that is, not as stewards, but as legal heirs and owners. We freely arrange and manage all these natural and gracious gifts. Children, you have heard today\u2019s gospel reading: \u201cAnd I say unto you, make friends for yourselves by unrighteous riches (mammon), that when you are poor, they may receive you into everlasting home\u201d (see Luke 16: 1-10). Unrighteous riches is everything that God Has given us outside the Church, and even more unrighteous riches is everything given to us within the Church. Each one of us is an unrighteous steward. Who is this unjust steward; what sort of unrighteous riches he manages and arranges; and why did the Lord praise him? What and how then can a man say something about Bogorodica (Birth-Giver-of-God) and Ever-Virgin Mary?",

Many of the demonstrators openly called for Moise's resignation, but the Haitian president refused to step down. News Haiti: Ariel Henry assumes post as prime minister Ariel Henry was formally inaugurated as Haiti's prime minister on Tuesday, almost two weeks after the assassination of late President Jovenel Moise. Henry has appealed for national unity as he takes office nearly two weeks after the assassination of late President Jovenel Moise. Moise took office in February 2017 and was a controversial figure in Haiti. Moise was shot multiple times during an attack at his residence in the upscale Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Petion-Ville on July 7. First Lady Martine Moise was also injured in the attack and airlifted to the US for emergency care. Henry, a 71-year-old neurosurgeon and former Cabinet minister, has called for unity in the Caribbean country. One of my priority tasks will be to reassure the people that we will do everything to restore order and security, he said. The new prime minister said the \"Haitian people\" are the solution to the country's political crisis after Moise's death. It's time for unity and for stability, Henry said after he was sworn in.

In the preparation of the legal solution we also included the academia dealing specifically with labor law issues. The cooperation with the ETUC and ITUC is of a great importance for us, and your support support for our Confederation is an indication that we are on the right path. Only together can we achieve our common goal and protect human dignity and workers' values. At the same time, we point out that all economic and social problems and challenges in the country cannot and should not be resolved solely through the backs of the workers. The Conference was attended by the Presidents of the branch trade unions affiliated in CCM, representatives of the social partners, high level officials of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), Mr. Luca Visentini, ETUC General Secretary, International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), ITUC Special Adviser, Mr Jaap Wienen, the Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Mr. Zoran Zaev, the Minister of Labor and Social Policy, Ms. Mila Carovska, ILO Country Representative, Mr. Emil Krstanovski, the President of UNASM, Mr. Slobodan Antovski, the President of BCM, Mile Boskov, Labor Law proffessors, PhD, Todor Kalamatiev and PHD Lazar Jovevski as well as other important stakeholders in society. Participants on the Conference The Minister of Labor and Social Policy, Mila Carovska emphasized that the new Labor Law is being prepared in line with the international standards and promotes European labor rights and social dialogue. Of great importance is our responsibility to defend, respect and promote democratic values, workers' and human rights. Following the Conference, a Press Conference was held Links to the statements: Caption 6. President of CCM, Darko Dimovski and the ETUC General Secretary, Luca Visentini The Republic of North Macedonia is a candidate country for EU membership, and despite the challenges that have been present lately, for us, this option is the only acceptable for our European position in terms of our position, but also in our need to accept European values for democracy and development. The new Labor Law has been discussing for two years, and we even call it the \"Workers' Small Constitution\" because of its importance, and through a careful, dedicated and patient way we have reached a successful stage for all parties. These issues are always a challenge for us, and therefore in this period, together with the social partners, through the social dialogue we work on the adoption of a new Labor Law, new Law on Occupational Safety and Health at Work, and it is worth noting that in the last period we have achieved a continuous increase in minimum wage through the social dialogue and cooperation with the government and employers. I expect the dialogue to continue in the coming period and to adopt a law that will be in the interest of all. The Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia today organized a High Level Conference on \"New Labor Law, Harmonization of National with European Labor Legislation\". Minister of Labor and Social Policy, Mila Carovska, Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, ETUC General Secretary, Mr. Luca Visentini, ITUC Special Adviser, Jaap Wienen, President of CCM, Darko Dimovski. The European Confederation of Trade Unions will stay at your disposal for any support and help in future if needed. We are facing with many trade union challenges both on national and European level. Presidents of branch unions affiliated in CCM and representatives of social partners Prime Minister Zoran Zaev stressed that social dialogue delivers results, but it should not stop here. There is a need to create more quality job opportunities for young people not to leave the country, but there is an also need to adjust wages and keep them at an adequate level as the living wage and it is also necessary to strengthen collective bargaining especially in the private sector. HIGH LEVEL CONFERENCE - NEW LABOR LAW, HARMONIZATION OF NATIONAL WITH EUROPEAN LABOR LEGISLATION At the conference, the President of the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia, Darko Dimovski emphasized that the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia is the oldest and most numerous trade union confederation in the country. Certain versions of the Law have been discussed by all social partners. I look forward to finding solutions to seasonal work, home and domestic work, fixed-term work, teleworking, equal treatment for men and women, and the need to abandon positive discrimination for women, as well as for full regulation of night work, and employment contracts for young people. In this regard we demand: the strength of trade unions lies in their numbers, training, competence, but also in their solidarity, support and joint action with you and all relevant Social Partners. As ETUC we have made very clear our position towards the European institutions for the process to be reopened, and at the same time we encourage the Government, trade unions and social partners in the country to improve mainly in two areas. The second concerns the reform of the Labor Law. There is a need for greater investment, creation of more jobs, and it is also necessary to set certain conditions when it comes to foreign investors coming into the country to exploit cheap labor and they need to respect the rules just as they do in the countries where they come from. We regret the European Council's decision not to open accession negotiations with the Republic of North Macedonia and we express our solidarity with workers and their unions. Finally I want to than to the President of CCM, Darko Dimovski and the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia for the invitation and the opportunity to participate in the Conference. We are aware that decent and equal living and working conditions for all without discrimination are achieved through creation and provision of real and sustainable jobs, social security, healthy and safe working conditions, poverty alleviation, protection of the environment and improved quality of life. - respect of the ILO conventions on freedom of association and organization - Promoting collective bargaining and social dialogue at all levels. The ETUC General Secretary, Luca Visentini said that the European Trade Union Confederation is very happy about the opportunity to be in Skopje today and to show solidarity to the trade unions in the country. The first concerns the economy, levels of employment and unemployment in the country, despite the very relevant efforts to increase GDP and raise the minimum wage, but this is not the needed level.

        "text":"A defender of God\u2019s truth, this wonderful saint was courageous defender of justice among the people. Since he was their only son given to them by God, the parents returned the gift to God by dedicating their son to Him. This glorious saint, celebrated even today throughout the entire world, was the only son of his eminent and wealthy parents: Theophanes and Nona, residents of the city of Patara in Lycia. Following the death of his parents, Nicholas distributed all his inherited goods to the poor, not keeping anything for himself. On two occasions, he saved three men from an undeserved death sentence. He was present at the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea [325] and, out of great zeal for the truth, slapped the heretic Arius. For this act he was removed from the Council and from his archiepiscopal duties, until the Lord Christ Himself and the Most-Holy Bogorodica (Birth-Giver-of-God) appeared to several of the chief hierarchs and revealed Their approval of Nicholas. When he gave himself over to solitude and silence, thinking to live that way until his death, a voice from above came to him: \u201cNicholas, for ascetic work go and labour among the people, if you desire to be crowned by Me.\u201d The meaning of the spiritual life St. Nicholas learned from his uncle Nicholas, Bishop of Patara, and was tonsured a monk in the Monastery of New Zion founded by his uncle. Being merciful, truthful, and righteous, he walked among the people as an angel of God. During the persecution of Christians under Diocletian and Maximian, he was cast into prison, but even there he instructed people in the Law of God. For this act he was removed from the Council and from his archiepiscopal duties, until the Lord Christ Himself and the Most-Holy Bogorodica (Birth-Giver-of-God) appeared to several of the chief hierarchs and revealed Their approval of Nicholas. A light shone from his face as it did from the face of Moses, and he, by his presence alone, brought comfort, peace and good will among people. Merciful, wise and fearless, Nicholas was a true pastor to his flock. In old age he became ill for a short time and entered into the rest of the Lord, after a life full of labour and very fruitful toil, in order to rejoice eternally in the Kingdom of Heaven, continuing to help the faithful on earth by his miracles and to glorify his God. As a priest in Patara, he was known for his charity, even though he carefully concealed his charitable works, fulfilling the words of the Lord: Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth (Matthew 6:3). Even during his lifetime, the people considered him a saint and invoked his aid in difficulties and in distress. He appeared both in dreams and in person to those who called upon him, and he helped them equally easy, whether they would have been close at hand or far away.",

The Court took this Decision with a majority vote in the following composition: the President of the Court Elena Gosheva, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Nikola Ivanovski, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. If the President of the Assembly cannot maintain the order at the session, he\/she shall order a short interruption of the session. The intervention was in contradiction of a series of other provisions of the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly (Articles 2, 225, 227) and Article 70 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia which related to the publicity of the sessions of the Assembly. Some journalists reacted to this kind of removal from the gallery, for a reason that the conflict situation in the assembly hall in those moments had escalated and the public had an interest in being unobstructedly informed about these developments. The President of the Assembly shall take the floor away from the Representative when he\/she with his\/her speech at the session violates the order, and at the same session he\/she is has been called upon twice to respect the order of the session. On the basis of Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Articles 56 and 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 16 April 2014, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following The application of Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje for the protection of the freedoms and rights referred to in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution related to the freedom of public expression filed through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje IS REJECTED. After the conclusion of the session a video of it was attached and available to all visitors to the website of the Assembly, and also the shorthand notes. In connection with the event the Association of Journalists applied to the Ombudsman, requesting him to find that this case had violated the right to freedom of expression and right to information. In the application, under Article 52 of the Rules, it is necessary to state the reasons why protection is sought, acts or actions with which they are violated, the facts and evidence on which the request is based, and other data necessary for the decision of the Constitutional Court. According to the allegations in the application, on 24 December 2012, a larger group of journalists including the applicants were present in the gallery of the Assembly Hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia to attend the session at which the budget for 2013 was supposed to be adopted. The application of Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje for the protection of the freedoms and rights referred to in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution related to the freedom of public expression filed through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje IS REJECTED. The freedom of speech, public address, public information and the establishment of institutions for public information is guaranteed. Free access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information are guaranteed. The right to receive and impart information was an integral part of the freedom of expression and with the right to public information encompassed the right of the media to unobstructedly perform its activities and inform the public. Under Article 51 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, each citizen who believes that an individual act or action infringed his\/her right or freedom set out in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia may request protection from the Constitutional Court within 2 months from the date of delivery of the final or effective individual act, that is, the day of finding out about the action with which the violated was made, but not later than 5 years from the date of its taking. Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the European Convention, these restrictions must be prescribed by law and be necessary in a democratic society for the accomplishment of any of the legitimate aims listed in this provision, such as protecting security, public safety, to protect against disorder or crime, and to protect the rights of others. The intervention was in contradiction of a series of other provisions of the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly (Articles 2, 225, 227) and Article 70 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia which related to the publicity of the sessions of the Assembly. The Ombudsman informed in writing that he asked the Interior Ministry to determine whether the officers from the Assembly security had acted in accordance with the rules for maintaining order in the Assembly building and the response by the Ministry of Interior but that despite the expressed concerns and position of the Ombudsman about the importance of freedom of information, he had no authority to act. On the basis of Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Articles 56 and 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 16 April 2014, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following The legal basis for the application of the contested measure is Article 43 of the Law on the Assembly that determines who is responsible for maintaining order in the Assembly building \u2013 special Assembly security service \u2013 and who authorises the President of the Assembly to decide and adopt measures for accountability for violation of the order in the Assembly by the Representatives and external entities that participate in the work of the Assembly. The application states that the act of forcible expulsion of journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall, violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Thus, they were prevented from doing their professional duty to report on the event, where there was a huge legitimate public interest. The President of the Assembly may warn and take away the floor from the Representative for violation of the order of the session. In this case the intervention of the state with the ejection of the reporters from the assembly hall and preventing them to follow the course of the session did not meet the condition of being stipulated by law and necessary in a democratic society. Article 43 of the Law on the Assembly which was invoked by the Interior Ministry and President of the Assembly did not legitimate the intervention of the assembly security, since that article (quoted in the application) did not give a possibility for intervention of the assembly security as in this case with forced expulsion of the journalists from the assembly hall and that it was an imprecise norm that did not meet the test of predictability or clarity that was required by the Court in Strasbourg for a norm to be law and provide a basis for restricting freedom of expression. According to the allegations in the application, on 24 December 2012, a larger group of journalists including the applicants were present in the gallery of the Assembly Hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia to attend the session at which the budget for 2013 was supposed to be adopted. On 26 December 2012 the Association of Journalists of Macedonia filed a petition to the Ministry of the Interior \u2013 Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards, requesting to identify the people who were part of the Assembly security and to initiate procedure for establishing their responsibility and to disclose the identity of persons who had given the order to the Assembly security to forcibly remove the journalists and to determine their liability. The session that the reporters were unable to attend, their inability to report on the events taking place during the session (the conflict situation which resulted in the forcible expulsion of the Representatives from the opposition) and the course of the Assembly session that followed thereafter, was one of the most important sessions of the Assembly during the year for which there was evident public interest in monitoring and reporting. The next day after the event, in a statement made before the media, the Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski articulated regret for the removal of the journalists from the gallery of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia: \"Probably in the entire chaos such an assessment was made which in my opinion should not have been made. Also, after leaving the gallery hall, the applicants and other media representatives had the opportunity to stay in other rooms in the building \u2013 the press center which is equipped with computer equipment from where they could follow the live broadcast of the session, which broadcast also went live via web streaming on the Assembly website and the assembly channel of MRT. From the above provisions of the Law on the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the Rules of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia it arises that the publicity in the operation of the Assembly is provided by the presence of reporters at the sessions of the Assembly and working bodies. Under Article 227 of the Rules, representatives of the media may, in accordance with the regulations of the internal order of the Assembly, attend the sessions of the Assembly and meetings of working bodies to inform the public about their work. The application of Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje for the protection of the freedoms and rights referred to in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution related to the freedom of public expression filed through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje IS REJECTED. Namely, what must be considered is the tense atmosphere in the Assembly Hall which practically precluded regular and normal start and course of the session. The persons from the special service for maintaining the order in the Assembly premises wear insignia of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on a noticeable place of their clothes. According to the assessment of the Court, the action to remove the journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall is an interference with the right of journalists to unobstructedly perform their activities and to inform the public about an event that is undoubtedly of major importance for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia \u2013 developments in the Assembly in connection with the adoption of the Budget for 2013 and for which the public had a great interest to follow and be informed. This practice of the security bodies is a common way of procedure in these and similar situations when it comes to threatening or guaranteeing the security of the representatives of the media in reporting from crises areas, demonstrations, and other potentially dangerous events, or the presence on incident situations with a potential security risk. At one point, a larger group of Assembly security staff approached the gallery and began to remove the journalists from the gallery. The Assembly security estimated that the gallery needed to be emptied, for the safety of those present in the gallery and the people who were in the hall. The fact that information was coming from the outside about possible escalation of the protests, and a violent breaking of the police lines, which additionally complicated the security situation in the Assembly, could not be considered to be a legitimate reason for this reaction of the assembly security. Pursuant to Article 43 of the Law on the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the President of the Assembly approved the police officers responsible for the security in the Assembly to restore order in the assembly hall and create conditions for the start of the session. The Assembly may decide to work without the presence of the public by a two-third majority vote of the total number of the Representatives. This decision shall be published in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\". Under Article 43 paragraph 1 of the Law on the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no. 104\/2009), the maintenance of order in the Assembly building and the premises in which the Assembly works is secured by a special service. The Association of Journalists through its President Naser Selmani, he in his personal capacity, Natasha Stojanovska, Frosina Fakova, Snezana Lupevska, Biljana Bogdanovska and Toni Angelovski, through the Law Office of Philip Medarski, on 22 February 2013 filed an application with the Constitutional Court for the protection of the freedom and right to public expression of thought. 104\/2009), the maintenance of order in the Assembly building and the premises in which the Assembly works is secured by a special service. In assessing the reasonableness and necessity of the application of the contested measure, that is, the action of removing the journalists from the assembly hall, the starting point must be the specific circumstances of the case, that is, the events of 24 December 2012 inside the Assembly building, that is,, in the hall for sessions, as well as the riots and disturbances of order taking place in front of the Assembly building. However, it should be taken into consideration that the exercise of freedom of public information and freedom to receive and impart information, as guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Freedoms and Rights as integral elements of freedom of expression are not absolute, that is, they are subject to restrictions set forth in paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the European Convention. Article 43 of the Law on the Assembly which was invoked by the Interior Ministry and President of the Assembly did not legitimate the intervention of the assembly security, since that article (quoted in the application) did not give a possibility for intervention of the assembly security as in this case with forced expulsion of the journalists from the assembly hall and that it was an imprecise norm that did not meet the test of predictability or clarity that was required by the Court in Strasbourg for a norm to be law and provide a basis for restricting freedom of expression. The application cited the views of the European Court of Human Rights relating to Article 10 of the Convention (cases Sunday Times v. UK, Lingens v. Austria, News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria) on the role of media in a democratic society. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. In order to secure the community, the legal system must sometimes limit the freedom of the individual to protect the freedom of others. The Ombudsman informed ZNM that he had no jurisdiction to act upon the case. Paragraph 3 of the said Article of the Law stipulates that carrying weapons in the Assembly building is not allowed except for persons authorised to maintain order in the building. It states that restrictions on freedom of expression must be prescribed by law, be necessary in a democratic society, aiming at the protection of specifically defined values. After all, the present journalists, most of them on the same day, submitted and published their reports in the evening editions of their media, suggesting that in the present case there cannot be a violation of freedom of expression of the present group of journalists. The explanation given by the Ministry of the Interior that the decision to remove the journalists had been made due to violation of the order in the hall by a Representative was absurd, because in such cases the security could have, if needed, removed that Representative, without any hindrance from the attending journalists. The applicants along with the other representatives of the media after leaving the hall remained inside the Assembly and from the other rooms (press center, hall adjacent to the gallery) could follow the live broadcast of the session. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. Physical removal of journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall which was imposed by the concrete situation of escalating chaos and disorder in the hall was intended to protect them and to ensure order in the hall, not to prevent the exercise of their activity \u2013 informing the public \u2013 and to restrict their freedom of expression. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. On 26 December 2012 the President of the Assembly Trajko Veljanoski gave a press statement which said among other things: Pursuant to Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen relating to the freedom of communication, conscience, thought and activity as well as to the prohibition of discrimination among citizens on grounds of sex, race, religion or national, social or political affiliation. Due to security threats, the President of the Assembly was taken out of the hall by the security, but the incidents in the hall continued. Free access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information are guaranteed. It states that restrictions on freedom of expression must be prescribed by law, be necessary in a democratic society, aiming at the protection of specifically defined values. To this request the public announcement of the President of the Assembly was forwarded to the Association of Journalists. The right to receive and impart information was an integral part of the freedom of expression and with the right to public information encompassed the right of the media to unobstructedly perform its activities and inform the public. On the basis of Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Articles 56 and 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 16 April 2014, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following According to the assessment of the Court, the action to remove the journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall is an interference with the right of journalists to unobstructedly perform their activities and to inform the public about an event that is undoubtedly of major importance for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia \u2013 developments in the Assembly in connection with the adoption of the Budget for 2013 and for which the public had a great interest to follow and be informed. Some of the journalists, among whom were also the applicants, opposed to being removed from the gallery, following which they were forcibly ejected by the use of physical force. Hence, the actual intervention could not be treated to have been prescribed by law only because no decision for removal of the public had been taken by a two-third majority vote, but also because of the fact that beyond this there had been no other legal option for the removal of the reporters from the assembly hall as in the present case. DECISION The application of Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje for the protection of the freedoms and rights referred to in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution related to the freedom of public expression filed through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje IS REJECTED. On 26 December 2012 the Association of Journalists also requested in writing from the President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia Mr. Trajko Veljanovski to provide information on who had ordered the removal of the journalists, which was the legal basis of the decision and to take legal action for the purposes of clarification of the incident. Pursuant to Article 43 of the Law on the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the President of the Assembly approved the police officers responsible for the security in the Assembly to restore order in the assembly hall and create conditions for the start of the session. The Association of Journalists of the Republic of Macedonia (ZNM) represented by Naser Selmani in the capacity of the President of ZNM, Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje, filed an application to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje, for the protection of the freedoms and rights related to the freedom of public expression. At its session, on the basis of the evidence that was submitted with the application for the protection of rights and freedoms and the response received from the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the Court established the following facts: On 24 December 2012 a session was scheduled in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in which the Law on Adopting the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia for 2013 should have been enacted. After the first incident happened, when I, as the President of the Assembly was attacked, when the technical equipment was also destroyed, and the security had to take me out of the plenary hall, the competent Assembly security, given that the gallery is in fact part of the plenary hall, made an assessment that the gallery must be empty so that no major incident could happen. At its session, on the basis of the evidence that was submitted with the application for the protection of rights and freedoms and the response received from the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the Court established the following facts: On 24 December 2012 a session was scheduled in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in which the Law on Adopting the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia for 2013 should have been enacted. For the session there was great interest by the public and media, given the importance of the Budget and the fact that in the days prior to the holding of the session, specifically during November and December, there were multiday, intensive, and at times tense discussions between the Representatives from the Assembly majority and the opposition ones on the proposed Budget within the local committee on finance and Budget in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 94 of the Rules of Procedure, the provisions for maintaining order at the session of the Assembly shall apply to all participants in the session. However, it should be taken into consideration that the exercise of freedom of public information and freedom to receive and impart information, as guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Freedoms and Rights as integral elements of freedom of expression are not absolute, that is, they are subject to restrictions set forth in paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the European Convention. On the basis of what has been stated, the Court decided as in item 1 of this Decision. Under Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure, the Speaker shall warn the Representative if with his\/her behavior, by taking the floor when the president did not give him the floor, by interrupting a speaker or by similar procedure he\/she violates the order of the session. Under Article 225 of the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly, the Assembly provides information to the public on the work of the Assembly and working bodies, as well as the permanent delegations to international organisations. The Association of Journalists of the Republic of Macedonia (ZNM) represented by Naser Selmani in the capacity of the President of ZNM, Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje, filed an application to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje, for the protection of the freedoms and rights related to the freedom of public expression. According to the allegations in the application, on 24 December 2012, a larger group of journalists including the applicants were present in the gallery of the Assembly Hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia to attend the session at which the budget for 2013 was supposed to be adopted. The passing of the Budget was of exceptional interest to the public because there was a conflict between the Representatives from the government and the opposition over whether the procedure was observed for the adoption of the Budget. Neither does the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia contain any special nor general legal reservation that would define the limits on the exercise of freedom of thought and public expression of thought, which is why its border should be sought in the wholeness of the Constitution and its provisions, thereby taking into account the above mentioned international documents ratified in accordance with the Constitution. All present in the gallery, including the applicants, were asked by the security to leave the gallery for safety reasons and to follow the developments from the press center. Especially important is that the journalists did not contribute to the conflict situation in any way, because they did not in any way disrupt the order in the Assembly building, had no direct contact with the President of the Assembly nor with the Representatives, so it is not clear why they were removed in order to restore order, when they had no part in its eventual disruption. On 25 December 2012, in a statement for the media Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski expressed regret for the removal of the journalists from the gallery of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, that it should not have happened and that an assessment had been made, which, according to him, should not have been adopted. At its session, on the basis of the evidence that was submitted with the application for the protection of rights and freedoms and the response received from the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the Court established the following facts: On 24 December 2012 a session was scheduled in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in which the Law on Adopting the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia for 2013 should have been enacted. For the session there was great interest by the public and media, given the importance of the Budget and the fact that in the days prior to the holding of the session, specifically during November and December, there were multiday, intensive, and at times tense discussions between the Representatives from the Assembly majority and the opposition ones on the proposed Budget within the local committee on finance and Budget in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. In connection with the event the Association of Journalists applied to the Ombudsman, requesting him to find that this case had violated the right to freedom of expression and right to information. Some journalists reacted to this kind of removal from the gallery, for a reason that the conflict situation in the assembly hall in those moments had escalated and the public had an interest in being unobstructedly informed about these developments. Pursuant to Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen relating to the freedom of communication, conscience, thought and activity as well as to the prohibition of discrimination among citizens on grounds of sex, race, religion or national, social or political affiliation. Especially important is that the journalists did not contribute to the conflict situation in any way, because they did not in any way disrupt the order in the Assembly building, had no direct contact with the President of the Assembly nor with the Representatives, so it is not clear why they were removed in order to restore order, when they had no part in its eventual disruption. This high level of guarantee of freedom of thought and its public expression in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, interpreted in international law cannot be applied indefinitely. On the basis of what has been stated, the Court decided as in item 1 of this Decision. This decision shall be published in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\". The passing of the Budget was of exceptional interest to the public because there was a conflict between the Representatives from the government and the opposition over whether the procedure was observed for the adoption of the Budget. The statement noted that the emptying of the gallery had been ordered to prevent a larger-scale incident and that the President expressed regret for the event with the reporters. In this case the intervention of the state with the ejection of the reporters from the assembly hall and preventing them to follow the course of the session did not meet the condition of being stipulated by law and necessary in a democratic society. However, it should be taken into consideration that the exercise of freedom of public information and freedom to receive and impart information, as guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Freedoms and Rights as integral elements of freedom of expression are not absolute, that is, they are subject to restrictions set forth in paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the European Convention. Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the European Convention, these restrictions must be prescribed by law and be necessary in a democratic society for the accomplishment of any of the legitimate aims listed in this provision, such as protecting security, public safety, to protect against disorder or crime, and to protect the rights of others. The legal basis for the application of the contested measure is Article 43 of the Law on the Assembly that determines who is responsible for maintaining order in the Assembly building \u2013 special Assembly security service \u2013 and who authorises the President of the Assembly to decide and adopt measures for accountability for violation of the order in the Assembly by the Representatives and external entities that participate in the work of the Assembly. The provisions for maintaining order at the session of the Assembly apply to all participants in the session. On the basis of what has been stated, the Court decided as in item 1 of this Decision. However, such an assessment was made and that's what happened.\" Let me remind that at the beginning without bans journalists were present in the gallery of the plenary hall. The Court took this Decision with a majority vote in the following composition: the President of the Court Elena Gosheva, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Nikola Ivanovski, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. Under Article 43 paragraph 1 of the Law on the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no. Pursuant to Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen relating to the freedom of communication, conscience, thought and activity as well as to the prohibition of discrimination among citizens on grounds of sex, race, religion or national, social or political affiliation. In connection with the publicity in the work of the Assembly, the presence of journalists and maintenance of order in the Assembly, the following provisions of the Constitution, Law and the Assembly and the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly are relevant: The statement noted that the emptying of the gallery had been ordered to prevent a larger-scale incident and that the President expressed regret for the event with the reporters. After the first incident happened, when I, as the President of the Assembly was attacked, when the technical equipment was also destroyed, and the security had to take me out of the plenary hall, the competent Assembly security, given that the gallery is in fact part of the plenary hall, made an assessment that the gallery must be empty so that no major incident could happen. For this assessment when it comes to the presence of reporters, I express my condolences as the president. Under Article 70 of the Constitution, the sessions of the Assembly are public. The Court took this Decision with a majority vote in the following composition: the President of the Court Elena Gosheva, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Nikola Ivanovski, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. In connection with the event the Association of Journalists applied to the Ombudsman, requesting him to find that this case had violated the right to freedom of expression and right to information. The Association of Journalists of the Republic of Macedonia (ZNM) represented by Naser Selmani in the capacity of the President of ZNM, Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje, filed an application to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje, for the protection of the freedoms and rights related to the freedom of public expression. Article 10 of the Council of Europe European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms envisages that everyone has the right to freedom of expression. The application of Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje for the protection of the freedoms and rights referred to in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution related to the freedom of public expression filed through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje IS REJECTED. That means that there was no advance intent to obstruct the journalists and prevent them from reporting on the session. Most of the journalists acted upon the recommendation, and smaller part of the present including the applicants began to confront the Assembly security, did not act upon the orders of the police officers and gave active and passive resistance, whereby one of the police officers was injured in the leg. I shall seek that the competent institutions conduct proceedings to establish liability for the event, and I want to once again appeal that I shall continue to make efforts for maximum openness and transparency of the Assembly.\" Under Article 51 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, each citizen who believes that an individual act or action infringed his\/her right or freedom set out in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia may request protection from the Constitutional Court within 2 months from the date of delivery of the final or effective individual act, that is, the day of finding out about the action with which the violated was made, but not later than 5 years from the date of its taking. The Interior Ministry replied that from the checks conducted it could not be established that excessive use of force and abuse of powers had been applied, that is, that the actions of the police officers had been in accordance with the Law on the Assembly, the Law on the Police, the Code of Police Ethics and bylaws of the Ministry. The very fact that since the morning of December 24, 2012 journalists were present in the Assembly and in front of the Assembly building and were reporting on the developments suggests that despite announcements and expectations that the discussion and adoption of the Budget would take place in a tense atmosphere, journalists were given access to the Assembly building and the gallery of the Assembly Hall in order to perform their job and to inform the public about the session. Pursuant to Article 43 of the Law on the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the President of the Assembly approved the police officers responsible for the security in the Assembly to restore order in the assembly hall and create conditions for the start of the session. The passing of the Budget was of exceptional interest to the public because there was a conflict between the Representatives from the government and the opposition over whether the procedure was observed for the adoption of the Budget. The Court took this Decision with a majority vote in the following composition: the President of the Court Elena Gosheva, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Nikola Ivanovski, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. After the event, the Association of Journalists of Macedonia reacted to the Sector for Internal Control and Professional Standards of the Ministry of the Interior and asked to have the identity of the persons who had thrown the journalists out of the hall established as well as the identity of the persons who had given the order for that with a view to sanctioning them. Article 10 of the Council of Europe European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms envisages that everyone has the right to freedom of expression. In connection with the publicity in the work of the Assembly, the presence of journalists and maintenance of order in the Assembly, the following provisions of the Constitution, Law and the Assembly and the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly are relevant: On the basis of what has been stated, the Court decided as in item 1 of this Decision. The passing of the Budget was of exceptional interest to the public because there was a conflict between the Representatives from the government and the opposition over whether the procedure was observed for the adoption of the Budget. The fact that information was coming from the outside about possible escalation of the protests, and a violent breaking of the police lines, which additionally complicated the security situation in the Assembly, could not be considered to be a legitimate reason for this reaction of the assembly security. On the basis of Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Articles 56 and 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 16 April 2014, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the European Convention, these restrictions must be prescribed by law and be necessary in a democratic society for the accomplishment of any of the legitimate aims listed in this provision, such as protecting security, public safety, to protect against disorder or crime, and to protect the rights of others. It was broadcast from start to finish in live coverage on the Assembly channel of the Macedonian Radio and Television via web streaming on the Assembly website. Freedom of expression is a subjective right that is inextricably linked to human personality and is a prerequisite for the exercise of many other rights and freedoms. Neither does the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia contain any special nor general legal reservation that would define the limits on the exercise of freedom of thought and public expression of thought, which is why its border should be sought in the wholeness of the Constitution and its provisions, thereby taking into account the above mentioned international documents ratified in accordance with the Constitution. This implies freedom of the media to get information on the basis of which they can perform their role, to comment and report on all important issues of public interest without restrictions in order to inform the public. Pursuant to Article 16 of the Constitution, which relates to civil and political freedoms and rights, the freedom of personal conviction, conscience, thought and public expression of thought is guaranteed. The application of Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje for the protection of the freedoms and rights referred to in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution related to the freedom of public expression filed through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje IS REJECTED. The application proposes on the basis of Article 55 of the Rules of Procedure the Constitutional Court to decide at a public hearing for which the applicants and their proxy will be invited to attend and after the hearing the Constitutional Court to find that the actions of forceable removal of the applicants from the hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 24 December 2012 by which they were prevented to monitor and report on the developments in the hall, violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Representative who is removed from the session is obliged to immediately leave the hall in which the session is held. On the basis of Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Articles 56 and 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 16 April 2014, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following The Association of Journalists of the Republic of Macedonia (ZNM) represented by Naser Selmani in the capacity of the President of ZNM, Naser Selmani from Skopje, Natasha Stojanovska from Skopje, Frosina Fakova from Prilep, Snezhana Lupevska from Skopje, Biljana Bogdanovska from Skopje and Toni Angelovski from Skopje, filed an application to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, through the Law Office of Filip Medarski from Skopje, for the protection of the freedoms and rights related to the freedom of public expression. Pursuant to Article 16 of the Constitution, which relates to civil and political freedoms and rights, the freedom of personal conviction, conscience, thought and public expression of thought is guaranteed. Under paragraph 2 of this Article, the authorised officials of the state government bodies cannot without the approval of the President of the Assembly have access to the premises referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, or take action against the Representatives, the workers in the Service and other citizens. On 24 December 2012 a session was scheduled in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in which the Law on Adopting the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia for 2013 should have been enacted. In order to secure the community, the legal system must sometimes limit the freedom of the individual to protect the freedom of others. On 24 December 2012 the representatives of the media, among whom were the applicants, were in the Assembly building, some of them were in the press centre, some in the corridors of the Assembly, and part in the gallery of the Assembly Hall in order to follow the session. At one point, a larger group of Assembly security staff approached the gallery and began to remove the journalists from the gallery. In the application, under Article 52 of the Rules, it is necessary to state the reasons why protection is sought, acts or actions with which they are violated, the facts and evidence on which the request is based, and other data necessary for the decision of the Constitutional Court. In this case the intervention of the state with the ejection of the reporters from the assembly hall and preventing them to follow the course of the session did not meet the condition of being stipulated by law and necessary in a democratic society. The session that the reporters were unable to attend, their inability to report on the events taking place during the session (the conflict situation which resulted in the forcible expulsion of the Representatives from the opposition) and the course of the Assembly session that followed thereafter, was one of the most important sessions of the Assembly during the year for which there was evident public interest in monitoring and reporting. Pursuant to Article 94 of the Rules of Procedure, the provisions for maintaining order at the session of the Assembly shall apply to all participants in the session. The right to a correction in the mass media is guaranteed. From these provisions (Article 91 of the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia) it also follows that the President of the Assembly is responsible for the maintenance of the order of the sessions, who may take more measures for a violation of the order of the session (reprimand, taking away the floor of a Representative, removal of the Representative from the session). The session on 24 December 2012 was public and available for monitoring. I want to remind that the measures required are planned and taken by the members of Assembly security. The application states that the act of forcible expulsion of journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall, violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Simultaneously outside the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia there were gatherings of two opposing groups whereby several people were injured. The right to reply via the mass media is guaranteed. According to the allegations in the application, on 24 December 2012, a larger group of journalists including the applicants were present in the gallery of the Assembly Hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia to attend the session at which the budget for 2013 was supposed to be adopted. On 26 December 2012 the Association of Journalists addressed the Ombudsman in writing and asked him to initiate proceedings on this case and find that the case violated the right to freedom of expression and right to information. The intervention of the State does not meet the test of necessity and proportionality in a democratic society, which was established in the case law of the Strasbourg Court. On the basis of Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Articles 56 and 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 16 April 2014, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following Under Article 51 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia, each citizen who believes that an individual act or action infringed his\/her right or freedom set out in Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia may request protection from the Constitutional Court within 2 months from the date of delivery of the final or effective individual act, that is, the day of finding out about the action with which the violated was made, but not later than 5 years from the date of its taking. On the basis of what has been stated, the Court decided as in item 1 of this Decision. According to the assessment of the Court, the action to remove the journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall is an interference with the right of journalists to unobstructedly perform their activities and to inform the public about an event that is undoubtedly of major importance for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia \u2013 developments in the Assembly in connection with the adoption of the Budget for 2013 and for which the public had a great interest to follow and be informed. For this assessment when it comes to the presence of reporters, I express my condolences as the president. Pursuant to Article 8 paragraph 1 line 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, basic freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution are one of the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. The application proposes on the basis of Article 55 of the Rules of Procedure the Constitutional Court to decide at a public hearing for which the applicants and their proxy will be invited to attend and after the hearing the Constitutional Court to find that the actions of forceable removal of the applicants from the hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 24 December 2012 by which they were prevented to monitor and report on the developments in the hall, violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. To this request the public announcement of the President of the Assembly was forwarded to the Association of Journalists. The statement noted that the emptying of the gallery had been ordered to prevent a larger-scale incident and that the President expressed regret for the event with the reporters. On 25 December 2012, in a statement for the media Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski expressed regret for the removal of the journalists from the gallery of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, that it should not have happened and that an assessment had been made, which, according to him, should not have been adopted. The passing of the Budget was of exceptional interest to the public because there was a conflict between the Representatives from the government and the opposition over whether the procedure was observed for the adoption of the Budget. Pursuant to Article 16 of the Constitution, which relates to civil and political freedoms and rights, the freedom of personal conviction, conscience, thought and public expression of thought is guaranteed. The response stated that on the critical day the President of the Assembly for security threats had been evacuated from the Assembly and on the basis of Article 43 of the Law on the Assembly he had authorised the police officers responsible for the security in the Assembly to establish order and to create conditions for the start of the plenary session. This decision shall be published in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\". Considering that it was announced that the opposition would not allow the budget to be adopted and protests and incidents were announced, on the basis of the Law on the Assembly Article 43 I asked from the Assembly security to ensure a regular course of the session.\t\u0418\u043c\u0430\u0458\u045c\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0434 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u045f\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438, \u0432\u0440\u0437 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d 43 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0442\u0435\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0430. Pursuant to Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen relating to the freedom of communication, conscience, thought and activity as well as to the prohibition of discrimination among citizens on grounds of sex, race, religion or national, social or political affiliation. Hence, the actual intervention could not be treated to have been prescribed by law only because no decision for removal of the public had been taken by a two-third majority vote, but also because of the fact that beyond this there had been no other legal option for the removal of the reporters from the assembly hall as in the present case. This assessment of the Assembly security, which is of solely security and in the function of protecting the persons present in the Assembly, should in no way be put in correlation with the guaranteed right of journalists to be present in the Assembly and to report on events to which they themselves were also direct witnesses. With the violent removal of the journalists from the assembly hall it was clear that it constituted a disproportion between the intervention (interference) of the state and the legitimate objective that with this intervention should have been achieved, as a result of which such intervention could not be treated as \"necessary in a democratic society \"in terms of the ECHR. The right to receive and impart information was an integral part of the freedom of expression and with the right to public information encompassed the right of the media to unobstructedly perform its activities and inform the public. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. From these provisions (Article 91 of the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia) it also follows that the President of the Assembly is responsible for the maintenance of the order of the sessions, who may take more measures for a violation of the order of the session (reprimand, taking away the floor of a Representative, removal of the Representative from the session). The provisions for maintaining order at the session of the Assembly apply to all participants in the session. According to the assessment of the Court, the action to remove the journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall is an interference with the right of journalists to unobstructedly perform their activities and to inform the public about an event that is undoubtedly of major importance for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia \u2013 developments in the Assembly in connection with the adoption of the Budget for 2013 and for which the public had a great interest to follow and be informed. The removal of the journalists from the assembly hall constituted essentially exclusion of the public from the session of the Assembly, which under Article 70 of the Constitution is only possible with a decision by a majority vote of the total number of Representatives. In this sense, one should take into account in particular the fact that the said situation resulted from the circumstance that following the entry of the President of the Assembly in the plenary hall in order to start the scheduled session, he was attacked by a large group of Representatives and immediately taken outside the hall by the security. The Court took this Decision with a majority vote in the following composition: the President of the Court Elena Gosheva, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Nikola Ivanovski, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. The session that the reporters were unable to attend, their inability to report on the events taking place during the session (the conflict situation which resulted in the forcible expulsion of the Representatives from the opposition) and the course of the Assembly session that followed thereafter, was one of the most important sessions of the Assembly during the year for which there was evident public interest in monitoring and reporting. At its session, on the basis of the evidence that was submitted with the application for the protection of rights and freedoms and the response received from the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the Court established the following facts: The Court took this Decision with a majority vote in the following composition: the President of the Court Elena Gosheva, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Nikola Ivanovski, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. The statement noted that the emptying of the gallery had been ordered to prevent a larger-scale incident and that the President expressed regret for the event with the reporters. On 25 December 2012, in a statement for the media Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski expressed regret for the removal of the journalists from the gallery of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, that it should not have happened and that an assessment had been made, which, according to him, should not have been adopted. In connection with the event the Association of Journalists applied to the Ombudsman, requesting him to find that this case had violated the right to freedom of expression and right to information. The explanation given by the Ministry of the Interior that the decision to remove the journalists had been made due to violation of the order in the hall by a Representative was absurd, because in such cases the security could have, if needed, removed that Representative, without any hindrance from the attending journalists. The fact that information was coming from the outside about possible escalation of the protests, and a violent breaking of the police lines, which additionally complicated the security situation in the Assembly, could not be considered to be a legitimate reason for this reaction of the assembly security. The application proposes on the basis of Article 55 of the Rules of Procedure the Constitutional Court to decide at a public hearing for which the applicants and their proxy will be invited to attend and after the hearing the Constitutional Court to find that the actions of forceable removal of the applicants from the hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 24 December 2012 by which they were prevented to monitor and report on the developments in the hall, violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. After all, the present journalists, most of them on the same day, submitted and published their reports in the evening editions of their media, suggesting that in the present case there cannot be a violation of freedom of expression of the present group of journalists. This practice of the security bodies is a common way of procedure in these and similar situations when it comes to threatening or guaranteeing the security of the representatives of the media in reporting from crises areas, demonstrations, and other potentially dangerous events, or the presence on incident situations with a potential security risk. The very fact that since the morning of December 24, 2012 journalists were present in the Assembly and in front of the Assembly building and were reporting on the developments suggests that despite announcements and expectations that the discussion and adoption of the Budget would take place in a tense atmosphere, journalists were given access to the Assembly building and the gallery of the Assembly Hall in order to perform their job and to inform the public about the session. The application states that the act of forcible expulsion of journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall, violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The surrounding and physical reaching for the President was accompanied by insults and threats. For this assessment when it comes to the presence of reporters, I express my condolences as the president. The surrounding and physical reaching for the President was accompanied by insults and threats. The applicants along with the other representatives of the media after leaving the hall remained inside the Assembly and from the other rooms (press center, hall adjacent to the gallery) could follow the live broadcast of the session. The application proposes on the basis of Article 55 of the Rules of Procedure the Constitutional Court to decide at a public hearing for which the applicants and their proxy will be invited to attend and after the hearing the Constitutional Court to find that the actions of forceable removal of the applicants from the hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 24 December 2012 by which they were prevented to monitor and report on the developments in the hall, violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. For the session there was great interest by the public and media, given the importance of the Budget and the fact that in the days prior to the holding of the session, specifically during November and December, there were multiday, intensive, and at times tense discussions between the Representatives from the Assembly majority and the opposition ones on the proposed Budget within the local committee on finance and Budget in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. At its session, on the basis of the evidence that was submitted with the application for the protection of rights and freedoms and the response received from the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the Court established the following facts: On 24 December 2012 a session was scheduled in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia in which the Law on Adopting the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia for 2013 should have been enacted. In such an occurring situation, accompanied, in objective terms, with a whole range of incidents, disarray, breaking of the inventory, which culminated with throwing objects around the room and towards the gallery, the security estimated, and in the interest of protecting the integrity and lives of the journalists present in the gallery, to act in such a way as to refer them to a safer place in which their lives would not be endangered. The Association of Journalists requested in writing from the President of the Assembly to shed light on the incident and sanction those responsible. When trying to start the scheduled plenary session, in the hall there was a violation of the order by a group of Representatives who began to destroy the technical equipment in the hall, blocked the Assembly rostrum, surrounded the President of the Assembly preventing him from execution of his function. The Interior Ministry replied that from the checks conducted it could not be established that excessive use of force and abuse of powers had been applied, that is, that the actions of the police officers had been in accordance with the Law on the Assembly, the Law on the Police, the Code of Police Ethics and bylaws of the Ministry. The application states that the act of forcible expulsion of journalists from the gallery of the Assembly Hall, violated the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Some journalists reacted to this kind of removal from the gallery, for a reason that the conflict situation in the assembly hall in those moments had escalated and the public had an interest in being unobstructedly informed about these developments. I shall seek that the competent institutions conduct proceedings to establish liability for the event, and I want to once again appeal that I shall continue to make efforts for maximum openness and transparency of the Assembly.\" Pursuant to Article 8 paragraph 1 line 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, basic freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution are one of the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 110 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen relating to the freedom of communication, conscience, thought and activity as well as to the prohibition of discrimination among citizens on grounds of sex, race, religion or national, social or political affiliation. Article 10 of the Council of Europe European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms envisages that everyone has the right to freedom of expression. From the above, it may be inferred that the very presence of reporters in the hall and direct reporting does not make a session public, since there are more ways that allow publicity of the work of the Assembly which were applied in this case. Freedom of the media as an integral part of freedom of expression, which inter alia includes the freedom of public information and the freedom to receive and impart information, also are foundations of a democratic society because free communication of information and ideas on political and other social issues of public concern is essential for any society. Their questions as to who ordered their forcible ejection and what was the ground and the need for that were not responded. For the session there was great interest by the public and media, given the importance of the Budget and the fact that in the days prior to the holding of the session, specifically during November and December, there were multiday, intensive, and at times tense discussions between the Representatives from the Assembly majority and the opposition ones on the proposed Budget within the local committee on finance and Budget in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. Consequently, the Court found that the violent removal of journalists \u2013 applicants from the gallery hall of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia on 24 December 2012 had not violated their freedom of expression.",

The Law on Health Insurance governs health insurance of citizens, the rights and obligations from health insurance, as well as the manner of implementation of health insurance. Article 57 of the Law defines the managing body of the Fund. The Fund is mostly financed from the funds of the citizens collected on ground of contributions or from the Budget of the Republic, as a result of which it is subject to public liability for the management with these funds. In the function of protecting the public interest of citizens, the legislator stipulated that the members of the Board of Directors of the Fund and the Director of the Fund, as performers of a public office, are appointed and discharged by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia.

U.no.40\/2007 4 July 2007 S k o p j e After the conducted announcement, the Director of the Fund, upon a proposal of the Minister of Health, is appointed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, which concludes a management contract with the persons appointed as Directors. Upon the initiative submitted by Stamen Filipov from Skopje, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.40\/2007 of 30 May 2007 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the part of the provision noted in item 1 of the present Decision, since there was a well-founded question raised as to its concordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.

Given what has been noted, the Court assessed that the challenged provision of Article 57 paragraph 2 in the part \"or a foreign\" of the Law on Health Insurance is not in accordance with Article 2 paragraph 1, Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3, and Article 51 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Upon the initiative submitted by Stamen Filipov from Skopje, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.40\/2007 of 30 May 2007 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the part of the provision noted in item 1 of the present Decision, since there was a well-founded question raised as to its concordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. The Fund is independent in its work. In the function of protecting the public interest of citizens, the legislator stipulated that the members of the Board of Directors of the Fund and the Director of the Fund, as performers of a public office, are appointed and discharged by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Given what has been noted, the Court assessed that the challenged provision of Article 57 paragraph 2 in the part \"or a foreign\" of the Law on Health Insurance is not in accordance with Article 2 paragraph 1, Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3, and Article 51 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.

Pursuant to Article 8 of this Law, the compulsory health insurance of insurees ensures them a right to basic health services under conditions defined by this Law, in case of illness or injury out of work and in case of an injury at work and professional illness. Under Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, sovereignty in the Republic of Macedonia derives from the citizens and belongs to the citizens. Pursuant to Article 58 of the same Law, the Director of the fund: \u2013 manages with the work of the Fund; represents the Fund; proposes general acts; sees to the implementation of the decisions of the Board of Directors, the regulations, and general acts of the Fund, and performs other tasks defined by the regulations, statute and general acts of the Fund. The Director of the Fund is appointed by means of a public announcement, for a term of four years, with the possibility for another election.

Upon the initiative submitted by Stamen Filipov from Skopje, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.40\/2007 of 30 May 2007 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the part of the provision noted in item 1 of the present Decision, since there was a well-founded question raised as to its concordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. From the analysis of the said legal regulation it arises that the Law on Health Insurance sets up a Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia, which is competent to implement the compulsory health insurance of citizens. The Fund carries out an activity of public interest and performs public mandates defined by this Law. Under Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 23 of the Constitution, each citizen has the right to take part in the carrying out of public mandates. In line with Article 39 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, every citizen is guaranteed the right to health care. Under Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. The Fund is independent in its work. Pursuant to Article 53 of this Law, a Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia is set up for the realisation of the rights and obligations from the compulsory health insurance. The Fund carries out an activity of public interest and performs public mandates defined by this Law. Article 57 of the Law defines the managing body of the Fund. Under Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, sovereignty in the Republic of Macedonia derives from the citizens and belongs to the citizens. Upon the initiative submitted by Stamen Filipov from Skopje, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.40\/2007 of 30 May 2007 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the part of the provision noted in item 1 of the present Decision, since there was a well-founded question raised as to its concordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.

Pursuant to Article 8 line 3 of the Constitution, the rule of law is defined as a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Under Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, citizens of the Republic of Macedonia have citizenship of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 2 of this Law, health insurance is established as compulsory and voluntary. Hence, given that the Health Insurance Fund is a public institution found for the implementation of the compulsory health insurance, the Court finds it undoubted that the managing function \u2013 Director of the Health Insurance fund \u2013 is a public office which by its character and significance is among the groups of public functions the carrying out of which is entrusted to the citizens-nationals of the Republic of Macedonia, and not to foreign persons. U.no.40\/2007 4 July 2007 S k o p j e Pursuant to Article 2 of this Law, health insurance is established as compulsory and voluntary. Under Article 3 of the same Law, compulsory health insurance is conducted by the Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia. U.no.40\/2007 4 July 2007 S k o p j e Compulsory health insurance is established for all citizens of the Republic of Macedonia with a view to providing health services and pecuniary compensations on the basis of the principles of comprehensiveness, solidarity, equality, and effective use of the funds under conditions defined by this Law and the regulations adopted on the basis of the present Law. Under Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Article 55 of this Law stipulates that the Fund is managed by a Board of Directors. Under Article 62 of this Law, the means for the work of the Fund are provided from the compulsory health insurance contribution and other sources of means of Article 37 of this Law. The impossibility for a foreign person to carry out this function does not mean suspension of the right to work for this category of persons, since that does not exclude the possibility for a foreign person to exercise the right to work, under conditions defined by law and international agreement, but not as the holder of a public office. Thus, as a novelty included in the Law on Changing and Supplementing the Law on Health Insurance (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.18\/2007) it is defined that the managing body of the Fund \u2013 Director -, consists of two persons who are equally responsible for the work of the Fund and for the obligations that are taken upon in the legal circulation. Article 57 of the Law defines the managing body of the Fund. Upon the initiative submitted by Stamen Filipov from Skopje, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.40\/2007 of 30 May 2007 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the part of the provision noted in item 1 of the present Decision, since there was a well-founded question raised as to its concordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. The Fund is mostly financed from the funds of the citizens collected on ground of contributions or from the Budget of the Republic, as a result of which it is subject to public liability for the management with these funds. The impossibility for a foreign person to carry out this function does not mean suspension of the right to work for this category of persons, since that does not exclude the possibility for a foreign person to exercise the right to work, under conditions defined by law and international agreement, but not as the holder of a public office. On the contrary, the stipulation of a possibility for a foreign person to perform the said public office, according to the Court, questions the sovereignty of the Republic of Macedonia which, pursuant to Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, derives from the citizens and belongs to the citizens. The funds for compulsory health insurance, pursuant to Article 37 of the same Law, are provided from contributions from: gross salaries and compensations to salaries of employees, pensions and compensations from pension and disability insurance, incomes of persons who have an activity of their own, funds for unemployed persons and funds of the other persons obliged for contributions, from additional contribution in case of injury at work and professional illness, from share of the insurees, from the budget of the Republic, from interests and dividend, from gifts, legacies, and from other incomes. Thus, as a novelty included in the Law on Changing and Supplementing the Law on Health Insurance (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.18\/2007) it is defined that the managing body of the Fund \u2013 Director -, consists of two persons who are equally responsible for the work of the Fund and for the obligations that are taken upon in the legal circulation. At its session the Court found that under Article 57 paragraph 2 of the Law on Health Insurance, a domestic or a foreign natural person who offers the most qualitative programme for the work of the Fund and who meets the following conditions: \u2013 university education from the field of management, economic sciences, finances, business administration, public health, medical sciences or legal sciences management; \u2013 at least six years of working experience from the field of finances or management or from the system and the organisation of health care and health insurance or from the system and organisation of health care and health insurance and \u2013 knowledge of the regulations from the field of health care and health insurance, shall be appointed as Director of the Health Insurance Fund. Under Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, sovereignty in the Republic of Macedonia derives from the citizens and belongs to the citizens. The Court passed the present decision in the following composition: the President of the Court Mr Mahmut Jusufi, and the judges: Dr Trendafil Ivanovski, Mrs Liljana Ingilizova-Ristova, Mrs Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska, Mrs Vera Markova, Mr Branko Naumoski, and Dr Bajram Polozani.

After the conducted announcement, the Director of the Fund, upon a proposal of the Minister of Health, is appointed by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, which concludes a management contract with the persons appointed as Directors. On the contrary, the stipulation of a possibility for a foreign person to perform the said public office, according to the Court, questions the sovereignty of the Republic of Macedonia which, pursuant to Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, derives from the citizens and belongs to the citizens. Under Article 29 of the Constitution, foreigners in the Republic of Macedonia enjoy freedoms and rights guarantees by the Constitution, under conditions defined by law and international agreements. The Board of Directors is composed of seven members who are appointed and discharged by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia for a term of four years. On the contrary, the stipulation of a possibility for a foreign person to perform the said public office, according to the Court, questions the sovereignty of the Republic of Macedonia which, pursuant to Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, derives from the citizens and belongs to the citizens.

From the analysis of the said constitutional provisions it derives that foreigners in the Republic of Macedonia have the freedoms and rights defined by the Constitution, except for those which under the Constitution belong only to the nationals of the Republic of Macedonia, with that that the conditions for their exercise are left to be defined by law and international agreements. In line with Article 39 paragraph 1 of the Constitution, every citizen is guaranteed the right to health care.

        "text":"Fact-checking Alternative medicine magazines continue to promote Putin's cult in North Macedonia and... These magazines continue to commercially exploit the positive perceptions of Russia and its culture that were already present in some of the Balkan populations, further contributing to reinforcing the propaganda positions of Putin's regime. The network of magazines promoting the 'brand Russia' and Putin's image in the form of alternative medicine advice continues to operate in most states following the breakup of Yugoslavia. According to World Bank data on average life expectancy by country, Russia, with 71.6 years, is at the bottom of Europe's level, which is an indicator of insufficient access to health services for the entire population. In April 2019, Meta.mk released an analysis indicating the impact of two magazine networks coming from Serbia, that are also distributed through direct exports to Bosnia and Montenegro and\/or through local publications in North Macedonia, Croatia, and Slovenia in local languages. Commercial promotion of pseudoscience and false hopes forlifesaving cures Even the Russian Orthodox Church, whose views against compulsory vaccination represent a reference to Balkan anti-vaxxers, has dissociated from situations where the state would declare an epidemic. The most prominent are \"Russian Doctor\" of the media conglomerate \"Color Media Plus\" and \"Russian Herbalist\" of the publishing house \"Novosti\", which are accompanied by a number of other similar publications. Thus, among other data about Putin's health, \"Russian Doctor\", according to Putin's press secretary,informs that he got the flu vaccine. Presenting the 67-year-old Russian autocrat as a young, masculine and healthy athlete is one of the basic postulates of a propaganda narrative that presents him as a ruler with \"extraordinary work ability and excellent performance\", according to Mironov. However, the penetration of some of the content intended for Russian audience points to a contrast. Thus, the content promoting various \"traditional remedies\" distracts, at least part of the audience,from the quality or (un)availability of public health services, or offers some comfort or \"alternative\". Unlike the activities of the Russian troll armies spreading anti-vaxxer propaganda in EU and NATO countries, their allies and candidate countries, internally, in Russia, the state promotes vaccination. Contrast between propaganda for internal and external use Also, the editorial board and the company are not obliged to give any explanations in written or electronic form or by telephone.\" The magazine ads contain many similar terms that sound scientific but have nothing to do with medicine,such as \"medicinal herbal candies \u2013 a new kind of cell cosmic food\", \"informotherapy\", \"quantum medicine\" by people photographed in white coats or with titles from \"academies\" \u2013 firms that are neither scientific nor medical institutions. Given the fact that most of the contents of such magazines are taken from Russian originals, most probably through licensing, their contents give insight into what is being served to Russian readers. In this sense, \"Russian Doctor\", in extremely small print, is trying to legally dissociate itself from lawsuits, stressing that \"for the truthfulness of the ads are responsible only those who advertise it, and that for the quality of the products for a particular disease are responsible only those who recommend it as a remedy. This propaganda tendency is useful not only for the Russian oligarchy regime, but also for the regimes of the Balkan states that have similarly degraded the quality of the health system in their countries. Judging by the graphic design and the low price, their main target group is the older population, especially the retirees, who are at the same time important as a sound part of the electorate. Alternative medicine magazines continue to promote Putin's cult in North Macedonia and the region The London Times recently suggested that one eighth of Russians survive with less than 175 euros a month and that \"there is no sign that the gap between the rich and the poor will decrease any time soon.\" The dubious credibility of the ads is also confirmed by the fact that the newspaper, on the third page, has repeated twice the following \"information plus\" which states that the publisher \"Color Media Plus\" and the editorial board \"are not responsible for the content and the truthfulness\" of the commercials, advertisements and promotions. He claims to be diagnosing diseases via Viber or WhatsApp\" in collaboration with a Russian colleague\". Financially unavailable to most readers are Putin's favorite \"potions\" such as Spanish red wine and \"special cocktails with a large amount of ice \u2013 50ml champagne, lemon juice, mint, syrup\". Thus, for example, in the latest, January issue of the Macedonian edition of \"Russian Doctor\", the front page content is the \"exclusive\" article about \"Putin's 10 secrets to health\". Proper nutrition and morning gymnastics are presented as \"secrets\" in this article, but sports such as skiing, hockey, horse riding and fishing are mentioned, which are largely beyond the financial reach of the target (retired) audience. In addition to the propaganda function, the commercial pages of this magazine are filled with advertisements from various local and regional fortune tellers and healers who offer horoscope consultations or promise miraculous remedies and cures, including \"cure for any cancer, with or without metastasis\" by a certain \"Doctor Cvetin\", who runs \"the first online neuropathic clinic for cosmic medicine in the Balkans\".",

The new project \"Regularly attending classes: Action for Inclusion of Roma in Elementary Education\" was launched by the Foundation Open Society \u2013 Macedonia in partnership with the Foundation for Educational and Cultural Initiatives Step by Step and the Association Center for Educational Support of children \"Dendo Vas\", funded by the European Union through the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of North Macedonia. The project will provide scholarships for Roma children enrolled in first grade, which will enable the inclusion of as many Roma children as possible in elementary education, while reducing the financial cost of Roma families associated with their children's education.

        "text":"Under the Local Roads Connectivity Project, which is part of the ongoing Country Partnership Framework, implemented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, EUR 70 million is intended to be disbursed to all 80 municipalities for construction and rehabilitation of local roads and streets, as well as other road infrastructure in local government units. Last week, Ministry of Finance informed the Government on the start of a reform geared towards strengthening the fiscal decentralization in the country. Local elections are schedules for this year. At the same time, we are undertaking activities to overcome the consequences of the COVID crisis on the economy and get the economy back to the pre-crisis trajectory. Sources of municipal revenues are diverse, with the own revenues on the basis of local taxes, such as property tax, tax on inheritance, tax on transfer of real estate, local fees and charges and revenues on the basis of ownership, being the most important one. Among the major ones is the Municipal Services Improvement Project (MSIP), implemented by the Ministry of Finance with support from the World Banka and the EU. any action that can be taken more efficiently and more effectively at local level for the citizens, such action to be transferred to the local authorities \u2013 a principle which has been accomplished neither by the expected volume nor by the envisaged dynamics unitl today, even two decades later. Such are the distribution of revenues from sale of construction land with 20%:80% ratio in favour of the municipalities, distribution of revenues on the basis of concessions for mineral raw materials with 22%:78% ratio in favour of the municipalities and additional revenues on the basis of fee for generation of energy from fossile fuels \u2013 eco-fee. Benefits from decentralization, as a process in general, are further democratization, exercising the competences as close to the citizens and their needs as possible, thus offering more efficient and more cost-effective services to them. Thus, Republic of North Macedonia falls within the group of countries with medium degree of decentralization, whereby it is worth mentioning that EU-27 average is significantly higher, i.e. 10.6% of GDP, in average higher by almost twice compared to our country. All municipalities, except for one rural municipality, entered the second stage. Fiscal decentralization was also carried out in several stages in which transfers from the Budget and the Funds' budgets were made simultaneously with the transfer of competences, in line with the Law on Local Government and other laws in the respective areas. Chronology of Fiscal Decentralization Among the major ones is the Municipal Services Improvement Project (MSIP), implemented by the Ministry of Finance with support from the World Banka and the EU. The Project commenced a decade ago, its total funds exceed EUR 100 million and it is aimed at improved municipal services through loans and grants for the municipalities to realize capital projects as watersupply, sewerage and waste water treatment, energy efficiency (street lighting, insulation of municipal facilities, etc. Compared to 2005, when the process of transferring competences commenced and fiscal decentralization was incentivized, municipal revenues have increased by more than six times in nominal terms, i.e. if revenue performance in 2005 amounted to Denar 5.9 billion, revenue collection in 2019 amounted to Denar 37 billion. Should one analyze the recent available data of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on share of revenues at local level (local government units (LGUs)) in GDP, it can be noted that, as regards Europe, Sweden exhibits the highest share of local revenues in GDP \u2013 16%, followed by Finland and Denmark with 14.79% and 14.12% respectively, Iceland with 11.7% and Norway with 9%. Two funds are envisaged to be established \u2013 Performance Fund and Equalization Fund. Municipalities showing positive results and higher own revenue collection will be awarded funds from the Performance Fund, while municipalities with lower revenues, but also showing fiscal effort and good results in collecting their own revenues, will be awarded funds from the Equalization Fund. The process was carried out according to the \"finance follow function\" principle. Building a well-established public finance system is an extensive process, comprising many segments. Like many transition economies, Republic of North Macedonia has taken up the process of transfer of part of the competences related to collection of public revenues and execution of public expenditures to the local government units. Compared to the countries in the region, analyzed according to the Report of the Network of Associations of Local Authorities in SEE (as per the preliminary data on RNM, its degree of fiscal decentralization is 4.9%), fiscal decentralization is lower in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina (4.5%), Albania (3.6%), Turkey (3.5%) and Slovenia (4.7%), but higher compared to Croatia (7.4%), Montenegro (6.5%) and Kosovo (7.7%). In 2019, share of LGUs revenues as percentage of GDP in the Republic of North Macedonia accounted for 5.4% (according to the data on GDP revised by the State Statistical Office). A serious step forward in the fiscal decentralization area in the country was made in July 2005, with the amendments and modifications to series of laws in the field of financing \u2013 Law on Property Tax, Law on Untility Fees and Law on Administrative Fees. Such direct support in the amount of EUR 500,000 up to EUR 2 million per municipality (depending on the project they apply for) provides for improved local infrastructure in the municipalities. Analyzed by share in GDP by current prices, if total municipal revenues accounted for 1.9% of GDP in 2005, they accounted for 5.4% of GDP in 2019, meaning that relative share in GDP experienced threefold increase. Among other principles and rules, authors at that time were led particular by the so-called principle of subsidiarity, i.e. Analyzed by share in GDP by current prices, if total municipal revenues accounted for 1.9% of GDP in 2005, they accounted for 5.4% of GDP in 2019, meaning that relative share in GDP experienced threefold increase. In the coming period, municipal development policies, i.e. It is envisaged for the percentage of PIT revenues distributed to the municipalities, collected from individuals with permanent or temporary place of residence in the respective municipality, to gradually increase. Fiscal decentralization is among them, as one of the priorities arising from the Accession Partnership of the Republic of North Macedonia with the European Union. any action that can be taken more efficiently and more effectively at local level for the citizens, such action to be transferred to the local authorities \u2013 a principle which has been accomplished neither by the expected volume nor by the envisaged dynamics unitl today, even two decades later. Three Pillars of Strengthening Fiscal Decentralization: Fiscal Capacity, Financial Discipline and Transparency and Accountability In addition to strengthening the fiscal capacity of the municipalities, activities should be undertaken and geared towards the quality of the operations, in particular increased transparency and accountability. In addition to the support as regards the transfer of competences for collection of part of the public revenues, as well as the Central Budget transfers, support to building municipal capacities is also implemented through projects of the central governemnt funded by international financial institutions. Activities will be also undertaken towards increased municipal own revenues by improving the efficiency of the administration and determining new local revenues in line with the EU good practices on service quality, as well as enhancing the criteria on distribution of funds for transferred competences in the field of primary and secondary education, culture, child care and care for elderly and firefighting. Funds in the amount of EUR 100 million are provided to all minucipalities, supporting the construction of better watersupply infrastructure and wastewater treatment plants. Three Pillars of Strengthening Fiscal Decentralization: Fiscal Capacity, Financial Discipline and Transparency and Accountability Many academic studies show correlation between the higher degree of decentralization and the higher economic development, which I will elaborate below. Throughout the years, as well as now, there are number of other projects for supporting the municipal development and strengthening their capacities. Such projects are implemented through several Line Ministries with credit lines from the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), EIB, KfW, Council of Europe Development Bank and other financial institutions and development partners (UNDP, USAID, etc.) and EU Funds. Starting 2013, revenues have been allocated as follows: 50%:50% ratio applies for both revenues collected by the municipalities on the basis of fee collected for issuing concession for using water resource for electricity generation and revenues from lease of agricultural land owned by the Republic of North Macedonia allotted to the municipalities. One of the governemnt priorities is continuation of the decentralization process to the end of greater democratization, improved (better quality and expanded) public services and intensified local development in the interest of the citizens. Throughout the years, as well as now, there are number of other projects for supporting the municipal development and strengthening their capacities.

Home BecT\u0438Strengthening fiscal decentralization with the aim of building better public finance system and economic growth In \"stage zero\", the municipalities provided the minimum necessary capacities for financial management. Many activities were undertaken in the past period aimed at announcing the financial reports so as to increase the transparency in terms of the municipalities' operations. On the other hand, share of LGUs revenues in GDP in the case of Western Balkans is 5.6%, being by 5 percentage points lower compared to the EU average (10.6%). For the purpose of strengthening the fiscal decentralization, many activities and measures are envisaged, grouped in three pillars \u2013 improved fiscal capacity and increased municipal revenues, strengthened fiscal discipline and transparency and accountability as regards municipalities' operations. At the same time, we are undertaking activities to overcome the consequences of the COVID crisis on the economy and get the economy back to the pre-crisis trajectory. Last week, Ministry of Finance informed the Government on the start of a reform geared towards strengthening the fiscal decentralization in the country. Public consultations and discussions with ALGUs and the stakeholders on reform proposals will soon follow, in coordination with the Working Group entrusted with the continuation of the decentralization process, established by the Government, with the Ministry of Political System, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local Government and ALGUs as its members. Strengthening fiscal decentralization with the aim of building better public finance system and economic growth Further decentralization is also one of the priorities set in the 2021 \u2013 2024 Government Program. Another major project implemented in the past ten years, aimed at improvement of the municipal infrastructure, is Water Supply and Wastewater Collection Project, funded by the European Investment Bank (EIB), the World Bank, KfW, IPA and budget funds, implemented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. It envisages implementation of many activities and measures which, at the same time, are to strengthen the fiscal capacity of the municipalities and the control as regards cost-effective, transparent and accountable operations. Decentralization process is implemented in several stages. fiscal decentralization and equal regional development, will continue to be implemented, to the end of strengthening the municipalities' financial sources, at the same time increasing the accountability and the transparency of their operations to the end of bringing the municipalities closer to the citizens. Nonetheless, there are exceptions, as well as different models of fiscal decentralization, which also depend on the levels of government, Besimi wrote. Should one analyze the recent available data of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on share of revenues at local level (local government units (LGUs)) in GDP, it can be noted that, as regards Europe, Sweden exhibits the highest share of local revenues in GDP \u2013 16%, followed by Finland and Denmark with 14.79% and 14.12% respectively, Iceland with 11.7% and Norway with 9%. Shared taxes fall within this group as well, i.e. 3% of the PIT revenues collected from individuals with permanent place of residence in the municipality and 100% PIT collected on the basis of craftsmanship. Under the Local Roads Connectivity Project, which is part of the ongoing Country Partnership Framework, implemented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, EUR 70 million is intended to be disbursed to all 80 municipalities for construction and rehabilitation of local roads and streets, as well as other road infrastructure in local government units. Starting 2013, revenues have been allocated as follows: 50%:50% ratio applies for both revenues collected by the municipalities on the basis of fee collected for issuing concession for using water resource for electricity generation and revenues from lease of agricultural land owned by the Republic of North Macedonia allotted to the municipalities. fiscal decentralization and equal regional development, will continue to be implemented, to the end of strengthening the municipalities' financial sources, at the same time increasing the accountability and the transparency of their operations to the end of bringing the municipalities closer to the citizens.

Building a well-established public finance system is an extensive process, comprising many segments. Strengthening fiscal decentralization with the aim of building better public finance system and economic growth In 2002, Law on Local Governemnt was adopted, defining the municipal competences, i.e. the municipalities to be able to independently regulate and perform activities of public interest of relevance to the local authorities. Many academic studies show correlation between the higher degree of decentralization and the higher economic development, which I will elaborate below. In fact, transfers from the central governemnt Budget serve more for a vertical, rathen than horizontal, balance in the development. Municipalities were to meet certain criteria, such as staffing and strengthening the financial capacity so as to be eligible to move to the second stage, which envisages competences in the field of culture, social protection, primary and secondary education and primary health care. Tax revenues, which the municipalities are authorized to collect, have increased by more than twice during the same period. Home BecT\u0438Strengthening fiscal decentralization with the aim of building better public finance system and economic growth Establishing the Performance Fund should be a careful process of transition with a support from the central government institutions in order to strengthen the local fiscal authorities in the municipalities showing significant underperformance as regards this component (not always a fault of their own). It envisages implementation of many activities and measures which, at the same time, are to strengthen the fiscal capacity of the municipalities and the control as regards cost-effective, transparent and accountable operations. Fiscal decentralization is among them, as one of the priorities arising from the Accession Partnership of the Republic of North Macedonia with the European Union. Such direct support in the amount of EUR 500,000 up to EUR 2 million per municipality (depending on the project they apply for) provides for improved local infrastructure in the municipalities. ), local road infrastructure (street and road modernization and reconstruction), utility services (procurement of vehicles for the public utility enterprises), as well as other municipal services and competences (construction of kindergartens, green markets, infrastructure in the industrial zone, etc. This Project will continue in future as well through the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, with additional funds unlocked for supporting the local infrastructure improvement. A comprehensive process of public consultations with the Association of Local Government Units (ALGU), the international development partners, the academicians, the business community and other stakeholders is planned to commence so as to reach otpimal solutions through an inclusive and transparent process. However, improvement can be certainly achieved considering that transparency provides the highest level of oversight over the public finances.

Home BecT\u0438Strengthening fiscal decentralization with the aim of building better public finance system and economic growth Fiscal decentralization is among them, as one of the priorities arising from the Accession Partnership of the Republic of North Macedonia with the European Union. The first stage included taking over the property and assuming the liabilities from the decentralized competences. Such are the distribution of revenues from sale of construction land with 20%:80% ratio in favour of the municipalities, distribution of revenues on the basis of concessions for mineral raw materials with 22%:78% ratio in favour of the municipalities and additional revenues on the basis of fee for generation of energy from fossile fuels \u2013 eco-fee. In the coming period, municipal development policies, i.e. fiscal decentralization and equal regional development, will continue to be implemented, to the end of strengthening the municipalities' financial sources, at the same time increasing the accountability and the transparency of their operations to the end of bringing the municipalities closer to the citizens. Like many transition economies, Republic of North Macedonia has taken up the process of transfer of part of the competences related to collection of public revenues and execution of public expenditures to the local government units. Many measures were adopted in the past years, aimed at increasing the municipalities' own revenues. Sources of municipal revenues are diverse, with the own revenues on the basis of local taxes, such as property tax, tax on inheritance, tax on transfer of real estate, local fees and charges and revenues on the basis of ownership, being the most important one. Nonetheless, there are exceptions, as well as different models of fiscal decentralization, which also depend on the levels of government, Besimi wrote. As regards the second stage, the municipalities took over the decision-making competences pertaining to the functioning of the budget users. Municipalities were to meet certain criteria, such as staffing and strengthening the financial capacity so as to be eligible to move to the second stage, which envisages competences in the field of culture, social protection, primary and secondary education and primary health care. Starting 2013, revenues have been allocated as follows: 50%:50% ratio applies for both revenues collected by the municipalities on the basis of fee collected for issuing concession for using water resource for electricity generation and revenues from lease of agricultural land owned by the Republic of North Macedonia allotted to the municipalities.

Two funds are envisaged to be established \u2013 Performance Fund and Equalization Fund. Positive Correlation between Decentralization Degree And Economic Development On the other hand, share of LGUs revenues in GDP in the case of Western Balkans is 5.6%, being by 5 percentage points lower compared to the EU average (10.6%). Other types of revenues are grants and transfers from the Central Budget, such as 4.5% of collected VAT and block grants for financing the transferred competences in the area of culture, education, social protection and child care. A serious step forward in the fiscal decentralization area in the country was made in July 2005, with the amendments and modifications to series of laws in the field of financing \u2013 Law on Property Tax, Law on Untility Fees and Law on Administrative Fees.

I believe it will be an interesting read about the significance of building a successfully functioning decentralized system aimed at improving the quality of public services and accelerating the economic growth and development a country. Municipalities showing positive results and higher own revenue collection will be awarded funds from the Performance Fund, while municipalities with lower revenues, but also showing fiscal effort and good results in collecting their own revenues, will be awarded funds from the Equalization Fund. The model of transfers (block or earmarked) from the central government is more like a deconcentration, rather than decentralization. In addition to strengthening the fiscal capacity of the municipalities, activities should be undertaken and geared towards the quality of the operations, in particular increased transparency and accountability. Thus, Republic of North Macedonia falls within the group of countries with medium degree of decentralization, whereby it is worth mentioning that EU-27 average is significantly higher, i.e. 10.6% of GDP, in average higher by almost twice compared to our country. Shared taxes fall within this group as well, i.e. 3% of the PIT revenues collected from individuals with permanent place of residence in the municipality and 100% PIT collected on the basis of craftsmanship. To that end, revising the methodology on distribution of funds on the basis of taxes and grants by municipality will be discussed. Second stage of fiscal decentralization commenced on 1st July 2007. Thus, Republic of North Macedonia falls within the group of countries with medium degree of decentralization, whereby it is worth mentioning that EU-27 average is significantly higher, i.e. 10.6% of GDP, in average higher by almost twice compared to our country.

Misajlovski in Berlin: public bid opened for stage two of the Pletvar - Gradsko express way Speaking at the Berlin Innotrans international fair for transportation technology, Macedonian Minister Vlado Misajlovski said that the international bid to build the second stage of the Prilep - Gradsko express way has been made public, in cooperation with the European Union. Another major project whose second stage of construction is now opened to potential bidders, Misajlovski said, is the railway link to Bulgaria. The project is divided in three sections, one is under construction, the second is now upcoming and the third will be completed in the coming years. Prilep, and by extension Bitola and the wider Pelagonija region, are linked to the main Corridor 10 highway through a narrow mountainous road going through the Pletvar pass. By the end of this year, we expect to select the construction company and we can have work started in the first half of 2017\", Misajlovski said, adding that the second stage of the road should be completed by 2019. Work is underway on the line between Kumanovo and Beljakovce, and the second stage would extend this line to Kriva Palanka, in a project worth 147 million EUR. Misajlovski said that another part of the Corridor 8, the railway line between Kicevo and the border with Albania near Struga is also in the planning stage.",

At the moment, with the Draft-Report Containing all proposed zones, we are waiting for the City of Skopje to submit a final version of this report and a revised Study for Revaluation of Natural Values of the protected area Monument of Nature \"Matka Canyon\". The Ministry of Environment states that in 2014 a Draft Law for Declaring Canyon Matka a Monument of Nature was prepared with proposed outer boundaries. In Matka Canyon, according to this document, not only the construction of platforms or pilotingmotorboats are banned, but no waste must be dropped nor wastewaters can be discharged. No noise nor vibrations must be made and no one can enter the caves without the guides. The decision is so thorough, it bans everyone to even pick a flower. Each building activity means disrupting this natural rarity, but unfortunately, Matka isn't by far as protected as it should be by City of Skopje's Decision, says Vasil Atanasovski, President of the Institute for Protection of Natural Rarities in Macedonia, despite the proposal that this protected area with its current boundaries be included in the National Emerald Area in 2006, that was approved by the Secretariat of the Bern Convention in 2009. At the moment, with the Draft-Report Containing all proposed zones, we are waiting for the City of Skopje to submit a final version of this report and a revised Study for Revaluation of Natural Values of the protected area Monument of Nature \"Matka Canyon\".",

The Government and the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services(AAVMU) yesterday and today exchanged sharp objections to the problems in media sphere in the past period, following the accusation from the Minister Robert Popovski on Friday that the Agency has not functioned and did not perform its competences for years, in the context retransmission of foreign programming services without copyright. Given the fact that the scope and the number of surveillance carried out are on the same level in the years indicated, a significant reduction in violations shows only one thing- that the Agency ensures consistent implementation of the law, says the reaction. At the same time, the Agency inform the right-holders, in order to initiate appropriate procedure against the operator, keeping in mind that the Agency has no opportunity to initiate court procedure on their behalf,\" says the reaction from AAVMU. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia reacted again today to AVMU saying that the Agency can not avoid responsibility for the media chaos in the past years. Last year, only six measures were imposed, again, without a single infringement procedure. The Agency Is vainly trying to hide behind overturned numbers and statistics that has not given any effect on preventing such disorder in the media sphere in the country. The media disorder was constantly silenced by the competent institutions, among which the initial call to put the AVMU in order. AVMU can not avoid responsibility for media chaos, says the Government AAVMU reacted yesterday that it was a \"non-argued, lump-sum statements whose intention is to discredit the work of the Agency, and it is especially surprising that they are given by a minister whose primary task should be accurate and well-informed information to the public\". This has resulted in the need for amendments to the Law of Audio and Audiovisual Media Services,\" stands in the Government's reaction. The media disorder was constantly silenced by the competent institutions, among which the initial call to put the AVMU in order. In 2015, the Agency stated 62 measures and instigated 23 infringement proceedings, and in 2016 stated 13 measures without one infringement procedure.

        "text":"Around 250 faithful from Skopje, from Bitola, Gevgelija, Ohrid, Struga, Resen, Tetovo, Gostivar and other towns in the Republic gathered to celebrate the memory of the mystical appearance of the Holy Archangel Gabriel to the Most Holy Virgin in Nazareth during Her prayerful stillness, which had been Her incessant practice for many years throughout Her so godly life. The great duke of immaterial angels, in the city of Nazareth did descend, to proclaim the King of the ages and the Lord to You, Most Pure, crying out 'Rejoice, blessed Mary, - unreachable and ineffable miracle: renewal of people!' The devout God-seekers who arrived to venerate the Most Holy Virgin with the monastic brotherhood in Bigorski began Vigil with the Small Compline, and finished the course of the festive worship at 5.30 am., in order to have some rest before the Divine Liturgy in honour of the great feast, which started after some two hours of rest. This custom together with the historical findings which reveal that in Bigorski at one time there was a chapel the altar of which was dedicated to Holy Annunciation, inspired the building in of a new such chapel in the recently reconstructed quarters. For the life of the Most Pure Virgin this event meant an ineffable change, and for the history of mankind \u2013 a sovereign revolution in the spiritual and eschatological dimensions of existence, restoration of the broken union with God with a new and inalienable opportunity for perfection. Today Gabriel proclaims to the graceful One: 'Rejoice unwedded Mother Who knows not of a man, do not admire my heavenly splendour, do not be afraid, I am an archangel; once the serpent deceived Eve, now I am proclaiming to You the joy that You will remain a virgin and will give birth to the Lord, Most Pure.' And, also entry into the heavenly Kingdom already here on earth, having the Most Pure Sovereign Lady the Theotokos and Evervirgin Mary as a permanent Intercessor, to Whom joyously in awe we cry out: This time, at the Vigil, the magnificence of the choir was enriched with the voice of the protopsaltist Georgiy Sekuloski. Our brave victorious Commander, we, Your servants delivered from evil, are singing hymns of praise to You, Theotokos, and You Who has invincible strength, free us from every affliction, so we can cry out to You 'Rejoice Bride Unwedded!' Last night in the Bigorski monastery an all-night Vigil was performed in honour of the Holy Annunciation. Annunciation (07.04.2005) In the spirit of the Hagiorite tradition on such feasts, the guests and monastics in the end gathered at the common table, to return afterwards in the cathedral for a thanksgiving prayer. Onwards, according to the good tidings, the power of the Holy Spirit overshadowed the womb of the God-seeker Mary, who had known not of a man, previously devoted to virgin life with a husband chosen to protect Her perfect spiritual struggle under the guise of a marriage. By this the womb of the God-chosen received within it the incarnation of the Only-begotten Son of God, so that He becomes the Son of Man, and in a body like ours, with the properties of His Divine nature, in our human nature to do away with the consequences of the fall into sin of our first-created Forefathers, in order to bring it to deification. The established tradition of the Annunciation Vigil in the Bigorski monastery follows the piety of the Miyak women from these parts, especially from Gali\u010dnik, who come to the monastery every year on the eve of the feast. The archangel proclaimed to the Virgin the first Divine intervention in the line of penetrating events of condescension that would comprise what we call today Divine Dispensation and Plan for man's salvation. The All-Pure Virgin lived completely different from Her ideas of fervent devoutness: instead of living in solitude and undisturbed exile, She lived as a mother and wife, still with the quality of an incomparable bearer of God's word for the road full of sufferings in this earthly life that finally brought Her to the perfect grace of a Heavenly Queen. Mankind by this got the chance to give 'gods by grace'. After the accomplishment of Christ's Dispensation of salvation, the people who desire fervently to follow the teaching of the Son of Mary and in accordance with this unshameful doctrine with God's grace to transform themselves purifying their hearts from passions, will experience deification of their person, to the extent of Christ's gift.",

Notes Leftover rolls can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days, covered with cling film. They are best served warm.

These Chocolate Raspberry Cinnamon Rolls are fluffy, tasty and full of flavours! Remove the pan from the oven and let the rolls cool for about 15 minutes. Serve them almost hot or warm. Filling: In a medium bowl combine frozen raspberries, cornstarch, cinnamon and sugar. They require a bit of kneading but even if you have no experience in this area, you would be able to make them. Cinnamon and raspberry go surprisingly well together and the chocolate is just the final touch they both need. Preheat oven to 200 degrees C (400 F). Cover the pan with aluminium foil and bake for about 30 minutes or until golden. You would need a mixer with a dough attachment and just a bit of time for the dough to raise properly. Gradually add the flour, mixing at low speed with the dough attachments of the mixer or just with a wooden spoon. Alternatively transfer them to the fridge for the night (in this case on the next morning allow the pan to sit in a warm place for an hour before baking the rolls). Evenly spread the glaze over the warm rolls right before serving. Use the parchment paper on the bottom to support the rolling by lifting it.

There are 4 proposed substantive changes in the existing Draft Law.

CCM believes that the Government needs to find mechanisms to prevent abuses, but also to protect persons who are not guilty for remaining jobless. This applies particularly to older workers, who for 5 years will exercise the right to pension. A key change that the Government and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy made to the Law is to reduce the period of benefit use from 5 years to 18 months.

        "text":"They know how to give you the space you need in order to park and let you pass them should you be in a hurry. Nonetheless, if they make up their minds to it, they can be excellent drivers. Your neighbor is nuts about antique cars. It is said that the contemporary world is full of conflict because people do not want, do not know how, or are unable to communicate with one another. If you blow your horn to try to get them to clear your way or to go faster, thickheaded from birth as they are, they will not move an inch or will drive even more slowly. Everything is quite clear, we are facing His Majesty the Lion. As every orderly person does, he will strictly stick to highway regulations and will scrupulously respect each sign. Your neighbor doesn\u2019t stop washing and getting his little economy car to shine, disinfecting the interior and exterior and never allowing his passengers to smoke inside the passenger cell. Over 30 pages long, your Astroscopia Natal Chart reveals everything you need to know about yourself and your destiny. Nonetheless, Scorpios are considered among the most lucid, cold-blooded drivers around who know how to find a way out of every situation. And if, on top of it all, they happen to be hungry, they could hardly care less about the traffic jam they are creating as they sit behind the wheel devouring a huge sandwich. Lost in the details, he more often than not messes up in regular situations, especially when driving at night and while moving on a major highway. Sagittarians will not take their foot off the accelerator and speed into their garage at 200 an hour. He will simply love the trip, will always be available and will amuse you to no end throughout the journey. Do not worry about it, since even though they love to win at the driving game and get themselves into danger without thinking twice about it, Geminians are among the best drivers in the entire traffic. This is the reason why Aquarians just love to be accompanied and are the first ones to stop and offer their help to other drivers, even when no one asks them. With them, you never know how they are going to behave in any given situation but you can bet that they prize beautiful cars. Hence, they loose contact with reality, react automatically and can create traffic problems. When he purchases a new automobile, in spite of all the alarm systems installed in it, he will not leave its side from fear of someone stealing it. What is more, he could not care less about the number of violations he incurs in the process. This is how come they immediately repair their vehicle\u2019s \u201cflaws\u201d. And when the red light prevents him from doing what he wants, he will swear at it endlessly. Then, his mistakes will pile on high along with his feelings of helplessness and depression. Lively and versatile, Geminians feel like they are crippled whenever they are without a car. Scorpio As you are strolling through the urban sprawl, you notice that one of the drivers whistles at every skirt passing by. Besides, he expects other drivers to always give him priority and to clear the way so he can pass to the front of the lane. Individualistic and original, Aquarians either love or hate to drive. And if they have the means, they change them often. Cancer You can be sure that you are dealing with an impulsive Arian, aggressive and intrepid. If you ever have the good luck to find yourself in the copilot\u2019s seat next to him, you will understand what Monza circuit participants feel, provided that you do not annoy the Arian by telling him how he should drive. As drivers, Capricorns are impatient and thrust themselves brashly into the traffic. This is the reason why, not wanting to quarrel with others, they hardly ever cut-in on others and always allow other vehicles to pass them instead. If you embark on a long trip, pick a Sagittarian to drive next to you. Many conflicts could certainly be avoided if, from our way of driving and our behavior at the wheel, we could decipher the impulses and reactions we and others have. In other words, Pisceans give in to others and often drive all wrapped-up in their inner world. If ever fate should have it that you find yourself occupying the passenger\u2019s seat next to a Leo and you are not in the mood to compliment him on either his car or his driving expertise, the best thing for you to do is to keep your lips sealed. However, if you are not traveling on a low traffic road, then get ready to see how this Cancerian panics and begins to behave uncontrollably from the moment of the first traffic jam. Among Librans you will find the most daring and the most courteous drivers. They keep steady nerves in the midst of dangerous situations but one must not forget that they are the ones who provoke them. They manage to emerge untouched from the biggest jam situations. Aries The most striking thing about them is that they need company while driving, and this is the reason why they often pick up hitchhikers. Do not open your eyes any wider, it is not a dream but only a sociable and talkative Geminian having fun with his friends. Otherwise, before you have had a chance of counting to five, it is quite possible you will find yourself hitting the pavement again. While driving in town, you notice that the driver of the red sports coupe next to you is on edge as he waits for the traffic light to change, that he suddenly speeds away before the light has turned to green, that he keeps his hand constantly on the horn and that he tries to pass everyone ahead of him. This is the reason why, if you are in love with a Cancerian, let him drive in the copilot\u2019s place. Always to be found in a comfy vehicle, Pisceans come to the verge of tears whenever being in a hurry they find themselves stalled at the red light. She will not fail to give you a passing hand. This is the reason why, once he has bought it, he will drive his vehicle for the rest of his days before willing it to children and grand-children. There is hence nothing surprising about him repairing his car himself as well as washing it, since a mechanic\u2019s services are too big an expense for the thrifty Capricorn. Nonetheless, if you wish for your Capricorn to preserve his cold blood, above all don\u2019t tell him what he has to do. Exaggeratedly vain and easy to vex, the Arian will not tolerate the defeat and you could wind up with a squashed nose. Slow and thickheaded in everyday life, Taureans are slow and thickheaded when it comes to driving style. And no doubt freedom for them is a must but to be in someone\u2019s company is synonymous with happiness. This is the reason why you can try following them: they will get you out any traffic jam you run into. Aquarians are visionaries ready to spend their life in the garage, trying to create a vehicle worthy of Back to the future. Pisces When you take a second look and see that the car in no way matches the driver, neither in style nor age, then the conclusion can only be the following: you are dealing with a Scorpio, secretive and sex-crazy. It resembles a living-room on four wheels, with handmade cushions on the back seats. Leo In the luxury car ahead of you, the driver is constantly admiring his own appearance on the rearview mirror. Waiting for the light to turn green, an old but well-kept automobile is right next to you. Who are you, after all, to criticize the King? Fortunately, whenever they are not happy with their automobile but have no money to change it, all they have to do is turn their imagination on in order to transform it into their dream car. Besides, the most audacious and spiritual among them will find a way of attracting the highway patrol only for the heck of making jokes at them. Behavior at the wheel, seen as a way of communicating, is truly a magnifying glass that enlarges our faults and virtues. Yes, no doubt, it is a representative of the Virgo sign.",

In particular, the question arises whether the inclusion of ethnicity in ID cards, in the light of the fundamental constitutional value \u2013 equitable representation, actually vulgarizes this constitutional value, because it seeks to turn it into a rigid mathematical representation, whereby the mandatory declaration of ethnicity in The entry of data in the ID card will mean a kind of sealed written statement on ethnicity, which will further prevent the courts from interpreting the free expression of nationality in the liberal-democratic spirit of the constitution. 27\/14, 199\/14, 27\/16, 35\/18 and 198\/18 and \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Northern Macedonia\" No. It is in the center of Article 8 paragraph 1 line 2 of the Constitution that the motives of the proposal for entering the ethnicity of the citizens in their ID cards should probably be sought.

As for the topic of this legal review and opinion regarding the inclusion of a column on ethnicity in the ID cards, the comparative data are absolutely unfavorable for the proposed changes, because no country in Europe, and hence no member state of The EU does not provide for the inclusion of citizens' ethnicity in their ID cards. The initiative to amend the Law on Identity Card dates back to September 2020, [2] when the Ministry of Interior proposed several amendments to the Parliament to harmonize this law with the Law on Misdemeanors. \u0414ocTa\u043fHo Ha: http:\/\/ombudsman.mk\/MK\/posebni_izveshtai.aspx. 27\/14, 199\/14, 48\/15, 154\/15, 5\/16, 142\/16 and 11\/18 and \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No. [7] \u0417akoH \u0437a a\u0434M\u0438H\u0438cTpaT\u0438BH\u0438 c\u043by\u0436\u0431eH\u0438\u0446\u0438 (\"C\u043by\u0436\u0431eH BecH\u0438k Ha Pe\u043fy\u0431\u043b\u0438ka Make\u0434oH\u0438ja\" \u0431p.

Hence, the introduction of the column for ethnicity redefines the meaning of the ID card by undermining the civic identity at the expense of the ethnic one and challenging the integration of the country into the European Union because no member state of the Union has established such a practice. Given that the reactions to these proposals range from complete opposition, to the acceptance of mandatory or optional inclusion of ethnicity in ID cards, it is worth considering national and international legislation in order to give a legal review and opinion on the proposal. in any of its provisions, is the term \"ethnicity\" mentioned, hence, evident from Article 110 which prescribes the prohibition of discrimination of citizens on the grounds of sex, race, religion, national, social and political affiliation, it is clear that in the Constitution, national affiliation has the meaning of ethnicity. [3] However, at the end of January and the beginning of February 2021, in the Parliament of the Republic of North Macedonia, several political parties submitted amendments to the draft law amending the Law on Identity Card.

Additionally, in the area of equitable representation of communities, there is an impression that smaller ethnic communities are only observers of the process, given that interethnic relations in the public discourse are predominantly presented as relations between the two largest ethnic communities. Namely, as seen in Article 1 of the existing law, the ID card is a public document that proves the identity, citizenship and address of the citizen. Finally, in order to consistently respect and fulfill the fundamental constitutional value of adequate and equitable representation of citizens in state bodies and other public institutions at all levels, Macedonian society has at its disposal a number of ways to improve the situation that should start with education. ethnicity. ethnic communities. From the data recorded in the already issued ID cards, it is clear that the existing Law on Identity Card operates with the term \"citizenship\", which comparatively, [10] makes the Republic of Northern Macedonia one of the 49 countries with such access to the data listed in the ID card. Data available in identification documents in 134 countries [5] The proposer probably had in mind the advertisements for employment in the public administration, [6] for which according to the Law on Civil Servants, [7] and the Law on Public Employees, [8] one of the conditions of the advertisement is stating the ethnicity of the candidate, which is given by the so-called balancer for the specific job.

(AN) 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.(T) 14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,(U) 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. 34 \u201cHow will this be,\u201d Mary asked the angel, \u201csince I am a virgin?\u201d 35 The angel answered, \u201cThe Holy Spirit will come on you,(AS) and the power of the Most High(AT) will overshadow you. 44 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 8 Once when Zechariah\u2019s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,(L) 9 he was chosen by lot,(M) according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.(N) 10 And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.(O) 68 \u201cPraise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,(BZ) because he has come to his people and redeemed them. 21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. 43 But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord(BB) should come to me? 80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit[d];(CR) and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel. 22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. 1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled[a] among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first(B) were eyewitnesses(C) and servants of the word. (AV) 36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child(AW) in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. The Birth of John the Baptist 18 Zechariah asked the angel, \u201cHow can I be sure of this?(AC) I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.\u201d(AD) 5 In the time of Herod king of Judea(I) there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah;(J) his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. (CA) 69 He has raised up a horn[c](CB) of salvation for us in the house of his servant David(CC) 70 (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),(CD) 71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us\u2014 72 to show mercy to our ancestors(CE) and to remember his holy covenant,(CF) 73 the oath he swore to our father Abraham:(CG) 74 to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him(CH) without fear(CI) 75 in holiness and righteousness(CJ) before him all our days. 20 And now you will be silent and not able to speak(AF) until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time.\u201d 21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. 62 Then they made signs(BS) to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. Zechariah\u2019s Song 67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit(BX) and prophesied:(BY) 6 Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord\u2019s commands and decrees blamelessly.(K) 7 But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old. 76 And you, my child, will be called a prophet(CK) of the Most High;(CL) for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,(CM) 77 to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,(CN) 78 because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun(CO) will come to us from heaven 79 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death,(CP) to guide our feet into the path of peace.\u201d(CQ) 63 He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone\u2019s astonishment he wrote, \u201cHis name is John.\u201d(BT) 64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak,(BU) praising God. 43 But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord(BB) should come to me? 58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink,(V) and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit(W) even before he is born.(X) 16 He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. 17 And he will go on before the Lord,(Y) in the spirit and power of Elijah,(Z) to turn the hearts of the parents to their children(AA) and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous\u2014to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\u201d(AB) 19 The angel said to him, \u201cI am Gabriel.(AE) I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.

        "text":"Alkaloid marked 25% growth in consolidated export, investments of MKD 275.5 million and 56 new employments in the period January - March 2020 Sales The business plan for 2020 adopted by the Managing Board of Alkaloid AD Skopje at its session held on December 27th 2019, anticipates investment of around 14% of the consolidated sales in tangible and intangible assets from own sources, a growth in consolidated sales of at least 7% compared to 2019, as well as a growth in pre-tax consolidated profit of at least 7% in comparison with 2019. The higher sales growth in the first quarter of 2020 is partly due to the increase in the security level of stocks of medicinal products among large number of our customers, especially in the export markets, which was particularly important for them in the difficult conditions for transport of goods. The breakdown of total consolidated sales by group of products shows that the best sellers are the products from the segment Pharmaceuticals \u2013 88%, with OTC products accounting for 22%, antibiotics - 21%, cardiovascular products - 13%, neurological products \u2013 12%, etc. According to the unaudited standalone Income Statement, in the period January- March 2020, the sales reached the amount of MKD 2,509,772,821 - 19% up compared to the same period last year. The total investments in non-current assets for the period January \u2013 March 2020 amounted to MKD 275,561,903, an increase of 42% compared to the first quarter in 2019. In March 2020 the management board of Alkaloid AD Skopje reached a decision on approval and payment of holiday allowances for its employees. The amount paid was MKD 29,687 gross or MKD 26,718 net. Shares According to the unaudited standalone Income Statement, in the period January- March 2020, the sales reached the amount of MKD 2,509,772,821 - 19% up compared to the same period last year. The breakdown by region shows that the countries of South-East Europe account for 36% of the sales, 23% of the sales were realized in the countries from Western Europe (EU and EFTA), Russia and CIS \u2013 11%, while the other markets account for 2% of the total consolidated sales. At the end of March 2020 there were 1,684 employees in Alkaloid AD Skopje and 574 employees in its subsidiaries and representative offices in the country and abroad, totaling 2,258 employees. The Chemistry Cosmetics Botanicals segment accounts for 12% of the total consolidated sales, or more precisely Chemistry \u2013 2%, Cosmetics \u2013 7% and Botanicals \u2013 3%. Operating results The share price of Alkaloid AD Skopje in January-March 2020 ranged from MKD 8,354.00 to MKD 13,400.00, with an average of MKD 12,114.03 per share which is 45% up compared to the average price in the same period in 2019. Globally, the gradual easing of restrictions, the restart of production facilities in various industries, the establishment of new rules and procedures for functioning in these complex conditions, give hope that, although in much more difficult circumstances, working conditions will slowly improve. Based on the results thus far, taking into consideration the expectations for the upcoming period, the Management of the company estimates that the planned sales and profit for 2020 are going to move within the already set planning goals. Russia and CIS region increased by 23%, sales in the USA increased by 39%, and sales in Western Europe (EU and EFTA) increased 12%. Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which reached MKD 541,246,199 saw an increase of 10%, whereas the net consolidated profit amounting to MKD 314,485,791 went up by 7%. Alkaloid marked 25% growth in consolidated export, investments of MKD 275.5 million and 56 new employments in the period January - March 2020 In the coming period, it is expected that during the second and third quarters there will be a certain balance in the level of supplies among customers and a decrease in the growth of sales revenues compared to the initial quarter.

Treatment of cancer depends on the origin of the primary cancer. It occurs when cancer cells infiltrate the blood and lymphatic system and thus reach other tissues in which the metastases appear. Depending on the situation, the treatment may include biological therapy, radiation therapy, surgery or their combination. Where do primary carcinomas metastasize most often? Some of the metastatic tumors don't have symptoms. In order to form the metastases,the cancer cells need to undergo several stages: to get out of the primary cancer, to enter the blood \/ lymphatic system whereby they could reach a new organ, to be able to \"survive\" at the new localization and to be able to defend themselves from the organism's immune system. The goal of treatment is to reduce the spreading of cancer. Most of these cells die, but some may invade new tissues, which again begin to grow and form new tumors. Symptoms of metastatic tumors depend on the size and location of the metastases. Metastatic cancer occurs as a result of having a primary cancer in a certain part of the body that has spread to other tissues and organs. The treatment is systemically performed with chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Generally, cancer cells that spread beyond the primary tumor cross into the bloodstream. Thus, they can reach every part of the body. In some cases the primary cancer is revealed through symptoms whichthe metastatic cancer caused. Treatment",

        "text":"We have shown that organised crime is a significant phenomenon in Kosovo. [41] In the interests of balance, I should point out that some reporting of this fear on the part of the captives has tended to dramatise the facts unduly. The silence and the failure to react in the face of such a scandal is just as serious and unacceptable. Thaqi can be seen to have spearheaded the KLA\u2019s rise to pre-eminence in the lead-up to the Rambouillet negotiations, both on the ground in Kosovo, and overseas. During the decisive phase of the armed conflict, NATO took action in the form of air strikes, while land operations were conducted by the KLA, de facto allies of the international forces. The KLA detained numerous persons, especially civilians in northern Albania close to the Kosovo border, on the accusation that they supported FARK and were therefore disloyal to the KLA cause. [14] See Expert Report quoted in the Limaj judgement. Furthermore we found[19] that the structures of KLA units had been shaped, to a significant degree, according to the hierarchies, allegiances and codes of honour that prevail among the ethnic Albanian clans, or extended families, and which form a de facto set of laws, known as the Kanun, in the regions of Kosovo from which their commanders originated. While there is also substantial evidence against the third suspect in this regard, Krasniqi, he remains a fugitive at the time of writing and therefore cannot be subject to charges under Kosovo criminal procedure. Pending Krasniqi\u2019s apprehension, and the efficient administration of justice, the trial of all three men should take place either in the District Court of Pristina or the District Court of Mitrovica in early 2011. The Albanian Kosovars and Albanian citizens who were involved in the smuggling operations presented them as heroic acts of resistance in the face of Serb oppression. The domestic strengthening of the KLA, in terms of its fighting capability as well as its credibility among the Kosovo Albanian population, seemed to play out, especially in the course of 1998, along the same trajectory as the escalating brutality of the Serb military and police clampdown. We have not engaged in mere rumour-mongering, but have rather described events on the basis of multiple testimonies, documents and objective evidence. There was extensive discussion around the so-called \u201cYellow House\u201d, located in Rripe, near Burrel, in central Albania \u2013 to the point where this house appeared to have monopolised the public\u2019s attention. The finances available to Thaqi\u2019s inner circle increased dramatically with the creation of a dedicated KLA fund known as Atdheu Th\u00ebrret (\"Homeland Calls\"). The testimonies on which we based our findings spoke credibly and consistently of a methodology by which all of the captives were killed, usually by a gunshot to the head, before being operated on to remove one or more of their organs. The KLA\u2019s senior regional commanders were, in their respective areas of control, a law unto themselves. They were surprising, in the first place, because they emanated from someone who exercised the highest official responsibilities, at the very heart of the judicial system tasked with prosecuting the crimes committed in the course of the conflicts that ravaged the former Yugoslavia. This is nothing new, and it is admittedly not exclusive to Kosovo. At the time of writing, EULEX has still not had access to the complete set of records compiled by the ICTY in this area of investigation. In the horror and perpetration of crimes there can be no principle of compensation. However, upon reflection, the house was merely one element among many in a far larger and more complex episode. MMA (Monitoring, Mentoring & Advising) does not count for much when the Kosovar partners do exactly what they want \u2013 the only remedial action the international liaisons can take is to write a report that goes up the chain of responsibility, and probably lands on a desk somewhere in Brussels and is treated with minimal urgency and a premium on political correctness. The facilities in which captives were detained in the post-conflict period differed in character from the wartime facilities: we have found that they were primarily rustic private residences in rural or suburban areas, including traditional Albanian farmhouses and their storage barns. There was, in addition, at least one custom-built element to the post-conflict network of detention facilities, which was unique in appearance and purpose. Unlike the KLA, FARK was built around a core of experienced military officers, ethnic Albanians who had served in the Army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. KLA control should not be understood as a structured exercise of power, and it was certainly far from assuming the contours of a state. It was in the course of this critical period that numerous crimes were committed both against Serbs who had stayed in the region and against Kosovar Albanians suspected of having been \u201ctraitors\u201d or \u201ccollaborators\u201d, or who fell victim to internal rivalries within the KLA. In April 2008 Madam Carla Del Ponte, the former Chief Prosecutor before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), published a set of memoirs, co-authored with Chuck Sudetic, on her experiences within the tribunal. Following the departure of the Serbian authorities, the international bodies responsible for security in Kosovo very much relied on the political forces in power in Kosovo, most of them former KLA leaders. The international organisations in place in Kosovo favoured a pragmatic political approach, taking the view that they needed to promote short-term stability at any price, thereby sacrificing some important principles of justice. The Parliamentary Assembly was extremely concerned to learn of the revelations of the former Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), who alleged that serious crimes had been committed during the conflict in Kosovo, including trafficking in human organs, crimes which had gone unpunished hitherto and had not been the subject of any serious investigation. We believe that there are sufficiently serious and substantial indications to demonstrate that that this form of trafficking long pre-dates the Medicus case, and that certain KLA leaders and affiliates have been implicated in it previously. The investigation does not, however, benefit from the desirable co-operation from the Albanian authorities. The document has subsequently been admitted as evidence in the District Court of Mitrovica, Kosovo, upon submission of the Special Prosecutors\u2019 office of Kosovo. Based on analytical information we received from several international monitoring missions, corroborated by our own sources in European law enforcement agencies and among former KLA fighters, we found that the main KLA units and their respective zones of operational command corresponded in an almost perfect mirror image to the structures that controlled the various forms of organised crime in the territories in which the KLA was active. Put simply, establishing which circle of KLA commanders and affiliates was in charge of a particular region where the KLA operated in Kosovo, and indeed in certain parts of the Republic of Albania, was the key to understanding who was running the bulk of the particular trafficking or smuggling activity that flourished there. [26] Fatmir Limaj, a former senior-ranking KLA commander, was indicted, tried and ultimately acquitted by the ICTY in a trial that encountered many problems with the integrity of evidence. It was as a result of these references that we tried to understand more clearly the intersection between the abductions and undeclared detentions in the context the conflict, and the activities of organised crime, which was prevalent in many sectors of daily life in the region. [11] Serge Brammertz, ICTY Chief Prosecutor, in a letter to me dated 17 December 2009. It is true that the whole story seems to have begun with the revelations about the \u201cYellow House\u201d. The ICRC speaks of about 1000 missing persons after KFOR\u2019s arrival, most of them Serbs but also Albanian Kosovars regarded as \u201ctraitors\u201d. For example, we have found no basis for the allegation that certain victims had one kidney removed before being \u201csewn up\u201d again, detained for another period, and then finally having the second kidney removed. So it is clear that the KLA held effective control in the region during that critical period, both in Kosovo and in the northern part of Albania near the border. The elements of proof taken in Rripe, in Albania, have been destroyed and cannot therefore be used for more detailed analyses. With the exception of a few EULEX investigators, there has been and remains a lack of resolve to ascertain the truth of what happened during that period, and assign responsibilities accordingly. [37] The estimated 40 persons does not include persons who were held at Durres on a basis so fleeting that their detention lasted only as long as it took KLA intelligence officers to conduct an interrogation. Muja notably made use of the Military Hospital in Tirana, Albania, and administered extensive supplies and equipment acquired by the KLA through foreign donations. The difference in Muja\u2019s case is that his profile in organised crime is scarcely known outside of the criminal networks he has worked with and the few investigators who have tracked them. In February 2004, an exploratory visit to the site was organised jointly by the ICTY and UNMIK, with the participation of a journalist. [38] The military grouping styled as Forcat e Armatosura t\u00eb Republik\u00ebs s\u00eb Kosov\u00ebs, or FARK (\u201cArmed Forces of the Republic of Kosovo\u201d), was nominally fighting for the same cause of liberation as the KLA, but was treated by KLA commanders as an adversary, with contempt and suspicion.",

        "text":"It\u2019s official declaration was also a struggle for autonomy of Macedonia and Thrace. \u201cThe relatively numerous Macedonian emigrants in America and Europe, traveling via Serbia and Greece, were hurrying to the Bulgarian capital where their compatriots were preparing for the epic struggle\u201d, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian volunteers from Macedonia and Thrace wrote in a Memorandum to the Allies and the US after the WW 1. The Bulgarian church, with center in Constantinople, called Exarchate emerged, and it included all the territories of the Beylerbey (an Ottoman administrative unit) called \u201cRoumelia\u201d. Republican political and economic \u201cautonomy\u201d, the Macedonian language, reinterpretation of history, the Macedonian church, and all other attributes of a distinct nationality have played a major role in de-Bulgarizing the Macedonian population.\u201d At the time Stephan Stephanov used to write it under the heading \u201cOur Word\u201d. After the chetas were sent to the enemy\u2019s disposal, the attention shifted to the formation of Macedono-Odrin\u2019s battalions. In Macedonia there was an interregnum again. Not a single Bulgarian changed his or her name, none joined the Greek or the Serbian Army. In the inhabitted points there were set up Councils of Elders and local police chieves were elected as the bodies of the new revolutionary power. The main task of the Ccs was to abolish the Serbian rule and to establish a Bulgarian one. The reform action had to be organized by foreign officers, on the head with a General. One of the first problems the BCCCM faced with, was to take the power away from the Serbs. The latter sent detailed information to the BCCC: Up to the end of May 1941 were freed as follows: from the Slivnitsa camp - 3101 men, from the Vidin camp - 120, from the Petrich camp -487, from the Nikopol camp - 2361, and from the Rousse camp - 812 men; totally, up to the end of May, 10 475 men were freed and sent to their native places. x x x Thanks to the combat experience amassed in earlier wars, it was possible to adopt a new approach to the organization of the IMORO chetas. It was considered dangerous in the light of the French stand adopted. On April 14, 1941 Vassil Hadjikimov arrived in Veles. Constantinople Patriarchate, using its privileged position before the Sultan imposed everywhere in the churches the Greek language. The national liberation movement of the Macedonian Bulgarians was developing in parallel to the Albanian and Greek. Until the end of September six battalions were formed in Sofia. In the face of the German troops of that time the Bulgarians from Macedonia saw their liberators. Addressing the Reichstag on 19th February 1878, i.e. fortnight before the signing of the Treaty of San-Stephano, the German Chancellor Prince Otto von Bismarck said: \u201cThe ethnographic situation of Bulgaria, as I know it from authentic sources and as it appears in the best map I know - that of [German geographer Heinrich] Kiepert - is this: The boundaries of the Bulgarian nationality descend on the west, almost without any mixture, even beyond Salonica\u201d. One of the first problems the BCCCM faced with, was to take the power away from the Serbs. In Greece we have many immigrants from Albania, quite a few from other European countries and the world. The integration of the Albanians and Turks in Macedonia was a Bulgarian idea, espoused by the IMORO leaders. One important aspect of the arrangements for the new division was its manning. The population of these places formed committees nevertheless. To avoid the mistake of the improvised formation of the Macedono-Odrin\u2019s Volunteer Corps in the course of the First Balkan War, the revolutionary theoretists assumed that no matter what group of powers Bulgaria would join, plans should be promptly worked out for mobilization of Macedonians and Thracians into a new volunteer formation. That is why, when the Bulgarian administrative authorities were established in this area, all Bulgarians aged between 20 and 40 were mobilized. There were quite a few such chetas, and the war strength of the Guerrilla Detachment varied throughout the war depending on operational needs. So, Bulgarian territories were left under Ottoman domination. A strong supporter of the idea of division of Macedonia, Serbia simply expected a war between Bulgaria and Turkey to enter in the Skopje district. The Unification was done with almost no casualties, and no adversaries. Scouts were the first to join the fray. The outbreak of WW2 on September 1, 1939 forced the whole Bulgarian society, and particularly the fugitives from Macedonia, to seek more actively ways for the liberation of the country. In the course of the talks it became clear that the problem of organizing the Bulgarian population in Macedonia could be solved by two active figures - Stephan Yanakiev Stephanov and Vassil Hristov Hadjikimov. They had both suffered, and would suffer again for the liberation of their native territories. Here was her access to the sea, here was her enlargement. The Unification showed as well that Bulgaria does not have any of the Great Powers as a constant friend: there were only Powers that had their constant interests in Bulgaria. Russian nation was beloved by the Bulgarian, but it was not the case with the politicians, most of whom had in those early years understood that moral values very often contradict with the political ones. It was the Exarchate to do that, and the Bulgarian population itself sponsored it. The Powers needed a small Bulgaria, they were not interested of the needs of the population. The first to be set up were six battalions grouped into three regiments. This was the territory where in fact the different wings of the Organization, the fractions and groupings found their combat field among themselves. The townsmen decided to create a local CC, which would have to follow the directives of the BCCCM for Macedonia\u2019s unification with Bulgaria. They sent a note to the envoys of the Great Powers to Constantinople, which expressed their hopes that \u201cthe excellent men sitting at the High Seat, inspired by philantropic sentiments, will impose an European sanction on the San-Stephano treaty thus recovering our ultimate deliverance\u201d. The townsmen had hidden the crosses from the graves, because the Serbs would violate them. The establishment of citizens-in-arms, consisting of the popular masses previously organized by IMORO, enhanced the army and the police capacity of enforcing law and order in Macedonia. They should be on the basis of the territories where the Bulgarians had self-determinate themselves. Being the Bulgarian nation in Macedonia was the strongest, this time the Ottoman authorities did not defend it. Occupied nations during the WW2 would be glad to have such an occupator, to build roads and plants. The establishment of citizens-in-arms, consisting of the popular masses previously organized by IMORO, enhanced the army and the police capacity of enforcing law and order in Macedonia. The population was simply to be Hellenized and Serbianized, and it had to do that in a Balkan manner - with tortures, murders, expelling to Bulgaria, prison, forceful mobilization in the army. And to make the absurd full, the Serbians, feeling discomforted by the rapid increase of the Bulgarian territory, declared a war to the latter. A heavy war in a heavy time. In 1912, the order of general mobilization for the conduct of a liberation war against Turkey stirred up universal enthusiasm in Bulgaria. Dobroudja was given to Romania, Moravia to Serbia, Macedonia and Thrace remained in of the Ottoman Empire. A substantial number of Bulgarians were mobilized in the Serbian and Greek armies as well: some 50 000 in the former and 20 000 in the latter. The Bulgarian recruits, however, fiercely resisted the forced mobilization and deserted when mobilized. The important thing is that the tens of thousand of Macedonian Bulgarians not only fled the alien armies, but also wholeheartedly sought their place in the Bulgarian army. The outbreak of WW1, the upheaval among Bulgarians in the newly liberated parts of Macedonia, the steady influx of refugees from Serbia and Greece and of deserters from those countries\u2019 armies gave Macedono-Odrin\u2019s revolutionary theoretists food for thought. But their interests contradicted with the interests of the Bulgarian population. This court sentenced V. Hadjikimov to death, and Stephan Stephanov to 16 years of prison. At a time when no power existed in Vardar Macedonia, before the establishment of the official power of the Bulgarian state, this rule of the people took care of everything that concerned the population: food supply, order, relations with the German and the Italian powers; liberation of captives - Bulgarians from Macedonia, who had been soldiers in the Yugoslavian army; preparation of the population to welcome the Bulgarian troops; organization of industrial and agricultural activities; education and culture, etc. The main goal of the armed struggle though, was expressed most clearly in the letter of the Melnik rebels of December 11,1878, which they sent to the chief of the Petrich police: \u201cWe took up the arms and will not leave them until we get united with the Bulgarian Principality\u201d. The main column carried on the offence in the fortified Serbian area and reached the Skalisti Vrh above Kriva Palanka, threatening Sultantepe from the west. The list contained 184 officers, most of them born in Macedonia. Till the end of 1878 however, no more overt action was attained. A teacher\u2019s committee was formed too, as a department of the BCCC. Communists created a pro-Soviet wing, which did the same. Bulgarian power was established, but still many missions were to be fulfilled by the Ccs, providing food for the people, reviving of the production and the market, functioning of the administrative boards and schools - all that had to be organized by the functionaries of the Ccs. Like many other Bulgarians from Macedonia, they were to be imprisoned after the war. Hadjikimov stayed in prison for more than 11 years. The principle of nationalities was very well formulated by the US policy, but the ambitions of Serbia and Greece did not coincide with it. Nevertheless the pressure of the Macedonian intelligence was great. Along with that, it was ordered to call for a 21-day training muster the former volunteers of the Macedono-Odrin\u2019s Corps, on record at the regimental draft registration offices, and \u201call Macedonians and Thracians from the newly liberated territories, who served in the former Drama and Syar brigades.\u201d There was not a single Serbian in the territory of the Ohrid Bulgarian Archbishopry. Socialist ideas at that time were a fashion among the younger people, but they were forbidden in the military school. The German commandant in Skopje answered the delegation of the BCCCM that he would give the power to the Bulgarians, if only they could give him proofs that the Bulgarians predominated to Skopje.. \u201cI allow myself to add that I am one of the honest Bulgarians in Shtip, I have worked for Bulgaria and for the Bulgarian idea, and during the World War 1 I used to be a volunteer in the Bulgarian army, I was wunded at the Albanian border by a bullet, and as a result I became an invalid.\u201d According to it the decisions from the Conference in Constantinople from January 1878 had to be taken into consideration. The centuries-old slavery in Macedonia - Greek, Serbian and Turkish, mental and political, economic and social as well, in the 20th century, is abolished. In the hall of the town\u2019s cultural house, in the presence of many townsmen a long discussian took place. According to the protocol, the purposes of the Committee were: to serve as a representative of the town of Veles, to keep contacts with all the foreign powers, and to defend the townsmen\u2019s economic, political and cultural interests. The reasons which led to the Kresna-Razlog Uprising - the foreign national and religious oppression and the semi-feudal methods of exploitation of the Bulgarian population in the conditions of stepped-up terror in the Ottoman Empire. Macedonia: Its Races and their Future. It was in 1934 when the decision of the Comintern was taken for the formation of the Macedonian nation. Up to 1878 there was not any noise about Macedonia, it was very rarely mentioned in the European documents. The Corps was reinforced with an engineer and workshop unit, a supply company, a subsistence transport and with an ambulance detachment. The hipocricy of the new regime entered in the everyday life of the people. As for their establishment, it happened during the Ottoman yoke, a Bulgarian state did not exist at that time to do that, to finance, and to organize that. In the performance of its military-administrative mission, the Division also reported to the Chief of the Macedonian Military Inspection District \u201cfor the maintenance of law and order in the area\u201d. With the start of training of Bulgarians from Macedonia and Eastern Thrace, the Commander of the Division Colonel Krustyo Zlatarev, and the Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Peter Drvingov drew up a mobilization directive. However, they were too many, and the battalion was soon overmanned and had to be augmented into a regiment. In 1903 they gathered in Solun (the Bulgarian name of Thessaloniki) and after a detailed analysis of the heavy socio-economic, political and ecclesiastical situation of the Bulgarian population in the two districts - Thrace and Macedonia, made the decision to organize the population into a \u201cBulgarian Macedono-Odrin\u2019s Revolutionary Committees\u201d. The congress of the Odrin\u2019s district was held in the end of June. The outbreak of WW2 on September 1, 1939 forced the whole Bulgarian society, and particularly the fugitives from Macedonia, to seek more actively ways for the liberation of the country. Hadjikimov to death, and Stephan Stephanov to 16 years of prison. The Mountain Division demonstrated the commitment and devotion of the Bulgarians in Macedonia to the liberation mission of the Bulgarian Army. It also demonstrated that the Turkish and Albanian population in Macedonia accepted a solution of the Macedonian question in favor of Bulgaria. In his reminiscences Vassil Hadjikimov wrote: \u201c He, who wants to get an idea of what the Serbian slavery is, must come here and get familiar with something else: the real face of the Bulgarian spirit. That was not true: they were appointed by the Ccs. So, whatever the considerations were, it looked like the German army gave the Macedonian population the possibility and the right to freely express its nationality. It was especially strong in Macedonia and this made the name of the district appear very often in the politics. Five years later - in 1767, the Bulgarian Archbishopry in Ohrid was forbidden. Everyday there were clashes in those regions between rebel bands passing the borders and Turkish border troops, and in the interior of Macedonia clashes between bands and Turkish forces. In fact the struggle was not against the Serbian administration, but a problem of obtaining proofs about the ethnical picture of the town, which the population had to present before the German powers. It manifested the high national consciousness and nationality of the population of the area as well as its lofty strivings to throw off the national and social dominion and to live a free life in the same home country with all the other Bulgarians. At the same time in the territories held by the Bulgarian Army the population enjoyed freedom and actively cooperated with the Bulgarian authorities. That was not true: they were appointed by the Ccs. Later on, when refugees from Dobroudja appeared, they were included also in it. Serbian aspirations towards Macedonia (By the way at that time the name Macedonia was used by the diplomats having in mind Bulgarian Macedonia, and it could be read whenever one reads diplomatic correspondence. In 1762 the Bulgarian monk Paisiy Hilendarski (born in Bansko, Macedonia), wrote the first Bulgarian history, which enlightened the people. The only victim on the very place were only they. The decision of the Great Powers to convene a congress in Berlin to review the San-Stephano Treaty deeply alarmed the Macedonian Bulgarians. Thousands of people left for Bulgaria and America, the Serbians were moving forward to form an organization, which had to help the Macedonian population. In the course of the war, however, the Division also performed combat missions on the Salonica Front. The wide participation of Bulgarian peasantry in the uprising was attributable to its aspirations to get rid of the hard socio-economic conditions and resolve the still pending and aggravated agrarian question in the region. Their participation was praised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Bulgarian Army Lieutenant-General Mihail Savov: \u201cWith their glorious deeds in the area of Kirdjali, Mastanli, Balkantoressi, at Saranli, Dedeagach, Merhamli, Malgrad and Sharkoy they have justified the sacrifices which Bulgaria is making for the freedom of our brothers in Macedonia and Thrace..\u201d A June 9th Coup d\u2019etat of the Army, in 1923, killing the Agrarian Prime Minister Alexander Stamboliyski, was followed by the provoked by Moscow Uprising in September the same year. A large-scale petition campaign was started - collecting signatures and addressing memoranda and pleas to the representatives of the Great Powers. The leaders of the Uprising sent over voivode Georgi Karaiskaki, a participant in the Bulgarian volunteer corps during the Russio-Turkish War, and his band to Olimpus, where he had to establish a contact and obtain the support of the local Greek detachments and of those who were passing to the north from Greece. This is precisely why the Regiment was incorporated into the 2nd Occupation Brigade in 1917. About 400 rebels attacked the Turkish garrison at the Kresna Inns and after 18 hours of fighting succeeded to crush its resistance. It organized demonstrations and meetings on the occasion of the liberation. At the same time Bulgarian Government was constantly accused by the Powers for supporting the movement, and it had often to declare its neutrality, although it was not easy to be neutral. They were defecting from the Serbian and the Greek army not simply to shirk military service, but to join the Bulgarian army. Communists created a pro-Soviet wing, which did the same. The permanent IMORO chetas were formed into a \u201cGuerrilla Detachment\u201d, just as Headquarters of Guerrilla Detachments had been formed at the beginning of the First Balkan War. The national liberation movement of the Macedonian Bulgarians was developing in parallel to the Albanian and Greek. In the new Bulgarian country there existed a state which cared about the education, but in the Empire this was not the principle. The rebels were aware that fighting for national liberation and unification they were actually fighting for the destruction of the feudal ways and for obtaining land. In this case the young Balkan nations had to make strong efforts to prove themselves. He promised them that he would not hurry to run to Bulgaria and hide himself from the Serbians, but would stay with the population and help it. The division of Bulgarians from Macedonia was one of the first Bulgarian formations to engage the Allied invaders in the area of Krivolak, sending a clear signal to the whole world that the enemy forces were unwanted in the former\u2019s native lands. In their capacity as Bulgarian army regulars, they were supposed to qualify for POW treatment. The transformation of the Byzantine Hellenistic ethnicity into a Greek nation tended to make the Slavic Bulgarian and Serbian people Greek. The townsmen had hidden the crosses from the graves, because the Serbs would violate them. As one of the IMORO leaders Hristo Matov put it, the organization assumed a \u201cmilitary shape\u201d during the war. But the direct reason for the creating of the first and mightiest revolutionary organization was the advance of the so called Serbian propaganda. They should be on the basis of the territories where the Bulgarians had self-determinate themselves. The decisions of the Berlin Congress crushed the hopes of the Macedonian Bulgarians to live a free life. Although the author of the document surely exaggerated, it may be sure that without these representatives of the rapidly developing and ful with modern ideas New World, Bulgarian cause would have had much difficulties. According to Yussouf Bei, the destiny of the Albanians demanded accord and friendship with the Slav peoples and principalities against the plots and claims of the Great Powers on the Balkans, and the honest Albanian patriots had to be well aware of the truth about Macedonia - in the districts, confined between Vranya, Shar, Ohrid, Kostour, up to Achichelebi area, he claimed that there lived about one million and a half Bulgarians. An important part of the activities of the Ccs was the organization of the guard in front of the shops, stores, etc. This Uprising was the embodiment of the strivings for national liberation and unification of the entire Bulgarian people at that time. The end of the slavery has come... And he explained that his son had begun his service in the Yugoslav army not because of any love towards this state, \u201cbut being from a poor family, he needed to find there temporary subsistence, with the hope that our country will be one day a part from the Motherland, and he would be able to serve to our dear Bulgarian Tsar and State.\u201d In the US cities like Memphis people have nothing to do with Egypt, but the latter was not angry with this. A meeting of Professors and teachers of Macedonian and Thracian origin gathered in the University and decided to cover with meetings all the country with protests for the passive policy of the Government, pushing it towards war with the Ottoman Empire. At that time the interests of the Bulgarians clashed with the Russian ones\u2019 and coincided with the Ottomans\u2019 . Because of the peculiarities of its formation, employment and missions, the regiment was under the concurrent authority of the High Command, the 11th Infantry Macedonian Division and the First Sofia Divisional District. The Regiment was billeted at the reserve sub-lieutenants\u2019 school in Knyazhevo, and another part in Gorna Banya. At that time the interests of the Bulgarians clashed with the Russian ones\u2019 and coincided with the Ottomans\u2019 . The detachment crossed the river Vardar, destroyed the railways, fought against the Turkish forces, but was dispersed and defeated to death. In a short time, with the help of the Bulgarian powers the Ccs restored them. It consisted in organizing LCCs, which had the right and the task to provide for the life and the food for the population. The Albanian population was friendly to the Bulgarian army and especially to the units composed of Macedonian Bulgarians. The Bulgarians in Macedonia did not reconcile themselves to the settlement of the Treaty of Bucurest, a repeat of the Treaty of Berlin. On November 8, 1878 the Uprising started in the Razlog area as well. In March 1916 the Regiment was transferred to Skopje, where it bivouacked about 1 km to the northwest of the town. A part of Macedonia, which was liberated, the so called Pirin district, was turned into a main basis of the revolutionary movement. But no alliance of the Bulgarian and the Greek elements was possible to attain. Only in June a hundred railway carts with food came from Bulgaria to Skopje. Under the leadership of the revolutionary activists, the population launched an armed struggle which grew into two uprisings against the tyrannical Serbian regime in 1913: the Tikvesh and the Ohrid-Debur uprisings. The example of the April Uprising in Bulgaria of 1876, when Europe was impressed by the Turkish atrocities and allowed Russia to attack the Ottoman Empire, inspired the strategists. Dr. Tochkov was also instructed on the matter by the High Command. This success showed that to establish Bulgarian rule was not an easy thing, and that a struggle should be waged for it. After the end of the Russo-Turkish War the social and economic situation of the population in the districts remaining under Ottoman rule abruptly deteriorated. The difference was that instead of two, only one autonomous Bulgarian state should be organized. With the start of training of Bulgarians from Macedonia and Eastern Thrace, the Commander of the Division Colonel Krustyo Zlatarev, and the Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Peter Drvingov drew up a mobilization directive. A June 9th Coup d\u2019etat of the Army, in 1923, killing the Agrarian Prime Minister Alexander Stamboliyski, was followed by the provoked by Moscow Uprising in September the same year. Nowadays many are asking a banal question: since they were strong Bulgarians, how was it possible that they recognized themselves as Greeks, as Serbians, and at last as Macedonians? The necessities of the historical moment always call for the right men. It was stationed in those two towns for garrison duty and maintenance of law and order in the post. A secret conference in a house of a Bulgarian teacher on April 24th was everything that could be done. Great quantities of food were sent from Bulgaria on the request of the BCCC. They were led by the member of the National Assembly, Andro Lulchev. Macedonia is liberated for ever. The end of the slavery has come... This fact was positive morale motivator too. The Mountain Division demonstrated the commitment and devotion of the Bulgarians in Macedonia to the liberation mission of the Bulgarian Army. With their urgent requests for help to the Bulgarians of the Bulgarian Principality and Eastern Roumelia, the active figures of this movement contributed to the establishment of these committees. Albert Long, who were the direct cause of this saving undertaking, Gladstone\u2019s name would never have come to be forever bound up with the liberation of Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian nation would never have existed, and the Russian Tsar would never have proclaimed the war of emancipation.\u201d Although the author of the document surely exaggerated, it may be sure that without these representatives of the rapidly developing and ful with modern ideas New World, Bulgarian cause would have had much difficulties. That is why the Bulgarian one had to coincide too. The successful formation of the Mountain Division increased the numerical strength of the Bulgarian Army. The leaders of the Uprising sent over voivode Georgi Karaiskaki, a participant in the Bulgarian volunteer corps during the Russio-Turkish War, and his band to Olimpus, where he had to establish a contact and obtain the support of the local Greek detachments and of those who were passing to the north from Greece. But no alliance of the Bulgarian and the Greek elements was possible to attain. The Kresna-Razlog Uprising made the climax of the struggles and protests of the Bulgarians in Macedonia against the decisions of the Berlin Congress. Spiro Kitinchev was appointed the first mayor of the city. The townsmen of Shtip seem to be the toghest Bulgarians. Bulgarian politicians were divided in many different groups: Agrarians and some others wanted to be faithful to the Western Powers and to Versaille; former officers from the Army, the several Liberal parties and the King were inclined for a revision of the Treaty, the Socialists and the Communists divided the society into classes and predicted clashes among them, even provoking them. This was the territory where in fact the different wings of the Organization, the fractions and groupings found their combat field among themselves. He analysed a talk that he had had with one of the prominent and most intelligent Macedonian revolutionary Boris Saraphov, one of the leaders of the Uprising. Here was her access to the sea, here was her enlargement. They were informed by the Bulgarians about the Turkish brutalities in the Philippopolis district in April 1876. IMRO of course was the most powerful and their leader Ivan Mihajlov was in fact a factor in the Bulgarian policy. Because of the peculiarities of its formation, employment and missions, the regiment was under the concurrent authority of the High Command, the 11th Infantry Macedonian Division and the First Sofia Divisional District. The national character of the legal action was enhanced the moet by the active participation of the Bulgarian intelligentsia in Macedonia in it. In this question, however, the guiding principles are clear and unmistakable. The Turkish authorities and the press for instance were trying to misinform the European public opinion in any possible way regarding the causes, character and range of the Uprising, the support of the Slav Committees in Russia, the participation of Russian officers in the Uprising and so on, and so forth. And that is why it was namely in Macedonia where the number of such farms was several times bigger than in the remaining Bulgarian lands that the agrarian question and the eastern, semi-feudal methods of exploitation stood with full force. He used to live in Sofia and I had the chance to often meet him. It would be an unpleasamt task to make a clear difference between the activities of the Ccs up to the arrival of the Bulgarian troops in the district, and after it. D o i n o v, D. Kresnensko-Razlozhkoto vstanie 1878-1879, S., 1979. Of a great importance was the preserving of the public order. All the authors unanimously claim that the Macedonian political question appeared after the Berlin Treaty, and it was as a part of the Bulgarian question. Why? One of the most important functions of the Exarchate was the organization of the education. The revolutionary mission consisted in destroying the remnants of the administrative power of the former Versaille Yugoslavia. The Headquarters of the Replacement Macedonian Regiment remained together with the 1st Battalion in Skopje for garrison duty. Pirin was not declared to be autonomous and was not declared to be for the Macedonians. The liberation struggle of the Bulgarian population in Macedonia and the pursuits of unification of the entire Bulgarian people in the situation set after the Berlin Congress confronted with the interests of the Great Powers, with their resolute and overpowering stand on observing the decisions of the Berlin Treaty. The functionaries of the Ccs prompted the contacts between students from Bulgaria and Macedonia. Those relations were in conformity with the events of March 1941. The most important conclusion, which could be made about the CC is that it was in only that single case after the catastrophes at the beginning of the century, that history gave the opportunity to the Bulgarians from Macedonia to make their self-determinatiuon without any pressure. It was in 1934 when the decision of the Comintern was taken for the formation of the Macedonian nation. Upon their arrival they were examined and deloused at the border checkpoints and then inducted. The German flag was taken down and the Bulgarian one was raised. His greatest will at that time was to become an officer in the Bulgarian army, as well as it was the case with many boys from Macedonia and Thrace. The first one was the director and the other the assistant director of the American school in Constantinople - the famous Robert College, where many of the extinguished Bulgarians were trained at the time. The Bulgarians in Macedonia did not reconcile themselves to the settlement of the Treaty of Bucurest, a repeat of the Treaty of Berlin. There was good reason to believe that they belonged in that very division. Although the territories of the Exarchate were divided into several parts, the latter continued to exist in Constantinople, nevertheless the Greek and the Ottoman authorities strongly insisted that it go to Sofia. In the middle of April in the village of Smilevo was held the regional congress of the Bitolja revolutionary district. The integration of the Albanians and Turks in Macedonia was a Bulgarian idea, espoused by the IMORO leaders. There were found documents in the Hoover Institutions, which show that prominent Macedonian revolutionaries actively insisted on making Union with Austria-Hungary and Turkey. The reason was that the Macedonian Turkish population suffered from the Serbians and Greeks together with the Bulgarians and a common struggle against the occupators was already being waged. This struggle in fact helped the formation of the Bulgarian nation. At the same time, being impatient and nervous, like all the emigrants are, impatient for the liberty to come sooner, and strongly convinced that it would come only with the help of the Bulgarian army, they directed their efforts in activities for involving the country into war with the Ottoman Empire. Alexander Georgiev - for the sanitation. A proclamation was published in the \u201cMacedonia\u201d newspaper towards the population of Skopje and the neighbourhood. This newspaper started to be edited again, as a continuation of the tradition of the Ccs \u201cMacedonia\u201d newspaper of 1941. This was not only declaration, it was the very war. This promise appeared later for legitimizing the struggle of the Bulgarian population in Macedonia and Thrace against the Ottoman Empire. What were the relations between the German military powers and the Ccs? On November 14, 1878 the British \u201cDaily News\u201d wrote about the Macedonian massacre, that the Bulgarian village Krishnitsa, near Melnik was slaughtered by the Turkish troops killing 360 people, fifty Bulgarians fled, but the Turks overtook them and stroke them dead, the newspaper read. And he explained that his son had begun his service in the Yugoslav army not because of any love towards this state, \u201cbut being from a poor family, he needed to find there temporary subsistence, with the hope that our country will be one day a part from the Motherland, and he would be able to serve to our dear Bulgarian Tsar and State.\u201d There were slogans for unification with Albania. The Albanian committee here was in connection with the one in Prizren, so that the behavior of the Italians and of the Albanians expressed self-confidence. Even some Serbian soldiers were freed, with the lie that they were Bulgarians. After the chetas were sent to the enemy\u2019s disposal, the attention shifted to the formation of Macedono-Odrin\u2019s battalions. The Macedonian-Thracian societies in the larger cities and abroad avalanched the General Staff of the Bulgarian army with requests and telegrams. The Unification was done with almost no casualties, and no adversaries. \u201cI allow myself to add that I am one of the honest Bulgarians in Shtip, I have worked for Bulgaria and for the Bulgarian idea, and during the World War 1 I used to be a volunteer in the Bulgarian army, I was wunded at the Albanian border by a bullet, and as a result I became an invalid.\u201d (The principle of the majority of the population is not a Balkan invention, it is an universal one. In the course of the war, however, the Division also performed combat missions on the Salonica Front. Bulgaria did not happen to be the country to help them, being in disorder after the WW1. In 1880 Ohrid was on the brink of an uprising. The problem was also connected with the preserving the Bulgarian character of the district. Combat activities against the Ottoman army took place, and the result was not a great one: instead reforms, the leaders of IMORO dr. A decision was made to organize armed detachments to defend the border and the Bulgarian population from the bashi-bozouk attacks, and at the same time to carry out intensive preparations for an uprising. It became gradually clear that Bulgaria was taking the side of the Central Powers, hoping to regain its irredenta with their help. In the historical works there is often mentioned that Bulgaria has entered the war on the side of Germany, against the Western democracies, and against its Liberator - Russia. But they were not united in a net. Of a great importance was the restoration of the reading clubs. The strategists counted on their popularity with the enslaved population and with the soldiers of the division. Its mandatory for them that they first enter the struggle, which is waged for the Liberation of our Motherland.\u201d They helped the Serbians and the Greeks. In the performance of its military-administrative mission, the Division also reported to the Chief of the Macedonian Military Inspection District \u201cfor the maintenance of law and order in the area\u201d. In the course of the war, however, the Division also performed combat missions on the Salonica Front. The successful formation of the Mountain Division increased the numerical strength of the Bulgarian Army. The other two districts were not active enough to be mentioned here. The establishment of the Bulgarian administrative authorities was an official act. They had to loudly express their strength, their number, their culture, and religion. The townsmen of Shtip seem to be the toghest Bulgarians. This was a process of whole nations self-determination, an expression of the will of the people to join Bulgaria after being liberated from the Serbian rule. The Razlog district actively participated in the national liberation movement of the Bulgarian people. Thus they hoped to help the liberation of their home countries. Some 150 enemy soldiers were taken prisoner. At the same time people got convinced that this struggle could be successful only if it was well organized, and if there was unanimity among the supporters of the different tendencies and groups. They worked down the following plan: first, if the conditions required that Bulgaria should not engage in the war, they would struggle for the autonomy of this region; second, if there were a plebiscite for joining any of the neighboring countries, they would urge the people to take part in campaigns, demonstrations, petitions for joining Bulgaria. In the very first days the volunteers in these courses in Skopje outnumbered 800. Of a great importance was the preserving of the public order. The functionaries of the Ccs did not allow personal revenge over the enslavers. The leaders of the uprising were approached by delegations requesting armaments and support. Now, along with expanding the scope of the petition campaign, the Bulgarians of Macedonia already started preparations for an armed struggle as well. The Ccs prepared lists of the prisoners, which were sent to the Ministry of War. The striving of the Bulgarian rebels to organize interaction with the Greek national movement in the southern regions of Macedonia dated back to the time of the preparations for the Kresna-Razlog Uprising. Their importance was out of the question. After the April Congress of the Bitoya District Leadership, the Supreme Commettee Leadership with General Tsonchev on top sent an appeal towards the Bulgarian officers, saying: \u201cAmong the Bulgarian officers there are hundreds of Macedonians and Thracians, who are called by the Fatherland. It arose in conversations among some representatives of the former Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (united). On the Balkans there were together with the Constantinople (which was the traditional Byzantine), also - the Serbian bishopric in Pech (Kosovo), and the Bulgarian - in Ohrid (Macedonia). The chetas were expected to scout enemy operations, movements and strength, and report to the nearest headquarters. So, in the process of organizing the Ccs in 1941 the basic part of the population was participating actively. This testifies to their democratic character. The main goal of the armed struggle though, was expressed most clearly in the letter of the Melnik rebels of December 11,1878, which they sent to the chief of the Petrich police: \u201cWe took up the arms and will not leave them until we get united with the Bulgarian Principality\u201d. What was the attutude of USA towards Bulgarian participation in the WW1 could be seen in a document, found in the archives of the Hoover Institution. George Washburn and Dr. Macedonia and Thrace should have to wait. Speaking seven languages, he was appointed telegrapher at the headquarters of the 3rd Macedonian Infantry Brigade. There was not a single larger Bulgarian family in Macedonia between the two world wars, to be not strongly suffered from the Serbian and Greek powers. After several months they murdered the Minister of the Intermal Affairs, and in the coup d\u2019etat against Stamboliyski the Macedonians participated actively, a Macedonian being the one to kill Stamboliyski. Quite a few of them were not members of the army proper, but policemen, civil servants, teachers, priests, taxmen, etc. This struggle in fact helped the formation of the Bulgarian nation. This court sentenced V. The Ottomans, on the contrary, aimed at weakening the enslaved population. Russians were against whatever division and thus weakening of the Orthodox world. One of the main missions, which the BCCC started to fulfil was to help free the Bulgarians from Macedonia who were captured in the German army as soldiers in the Yugoslav army; as well as all the political prisoners from the prisons in Versaille Yugoslavia. The schools were closed, the priests and all the intelligentsia was expelled to Bulgaria. But how do we know their boundaries? Or at least what were the developments, which led to the expression of the Bulgarian population to be the majority at certain regions, which then one could call Bulgarian. It was called \u201cMacedonia\u201d and published most of the documents and the decisions of the BCCCM. Two days after the mobilization was decreed, on September 19, 1912, the Executive Board of the Macedono-Thracian charitable brotherhoods called up all emigrants who had not served in the army. The Albanian League had a specific attitude to the course of events at the time. \u201cWithout losing a moment of time, these two philantropic Americans set to work and persuaded their good friend Mr. Russian nation was beloved by the Bulgarian, but it was not the case with the politicians, most of whom had in those early years understood that moral values very often contradict with the political ones. The struggle for overtaking the power in Skopje showed that in other Macedonian towns the Serbs might also have strong positions; that is why the immediate formation of local committees was necessary. One of its first tasks was to send a telegram to Dr. This is a secret letter to the chief of the Secret Cabinet of the King Dobrovich from the secretary of the American Consul in Sofia Murphy. To a large extent the division of oppinions among the leaders of the Uprising also contributed to the defeat. The hostilities were supervised by the headquarters of the uprising under the command of Dimiter Popgueorgiev. In May 1878 this detachment entered Macedonia, but irrespective of the sympathies of the population it failed to fulfil the task set, due to the lack of efficient preliminary organization. We should naturally mention here the revolutionary movement of Yusuf Ali Bei, an Albanian from Debar. Though insignificant, it came out with a clearly proclaimed programme of joint struggle of the Bulgarian and Albanian population against the Turkish feudal rule. According to Yussouf Bei, the destiny of the Albanians demanded accord and friendship with the Slav peoples and principalities against the plots and claims of the Great Powers on the Balkans, and the honest Albanian patriots had to be well aware of the truth about Macedonia - in the districts, confined between Vranya, Shar, Ohrid, Kostour, up to Achichelebi area, he claimed that there lived about one million and a half Bulgarians. Most important reason for the limited outcome of the Kresna-Razlog Uprising and its failure was the unfavourable foreign political situation. Quite a few Macedonians and Thracians however had arrived in Bulgaria recently and had not seen service in the Bulgarian army. They were also eager to sign up.",

According to most polls, the AKP's government coalition with the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) is losing popularity. CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu has even called for elections to be moved ahead so that the opposition can capitalize on its momentum. The CHP, which is Turkey's largest opposition party, is doing everything it can to seize power with the help of its partners, even coining an official slogan: \"Governing with friends.\" IYI leader Meral Aksener said: \"We are ready.\" The CHP will surely be pleased to have the support of the Democracy and Progress Party (DEVA) and the Future Party (Gelecek Partisi) as well. Turkey's largest opposition party has called for snap elections, receiving support from most parties except the ruling AKP and its coalition partner. Snap elections are the only solution, says Ozel, who explains the idea of coaxing the AKP's smaller partner away: \"The MHP's seeming lack of concern about the country's problems and its unconditional support for the government make no sense. As a result, the number of new infections is considerably higher than previously declared. Watch video 00:49 The Turkish government is not interested in snap elections. Though neither party enjoys more than about 3-5% support, they are both dangerous for the president as they could potentially win over disappointed AKP voters.

The purpose of the study was to show flexible partial prostheses as a method for prosthetic treatment in children. Conclusion: Partial dentures in childhood should only be temporary solutions until the development and development of children is completed. Materials and Methods: The materials for this study were obtained with extensive searches from the relevant literature. They have very low weight. Denture base is reduced, thus avoiding the feeling of nausea in children.

The amendment published in the Official Gazette No. The amendments published in the Official Gazette No. 170\/2013 have been adopted in a direction of precise regulation of periods of obsolescence of initiating and conducting a procedure for determining dismissal liability of employment contract due to employees fault. boosting employment policies, A key consent on the provisions of the proposed legislation has been reached in order to be clarified and further regulated in the collective agreements. 03-00 of 08.01.2014, the Independent Trade Union of Health, Pharmacy and Social Care of Republic of Macedonia No. One of the provisions of NAPE is increased investment in economic sectors and enterprises with major impact on youth employment by providing loans and other services for development of enterprises. This applies only to the base of the average wage. Internship program- to include young unemployed up to 29 years of age (active jobseekers) who have completed at least secondary education, through their involvement in internship programs for a period of three months. The training will include unemployed persons with primary and secondary education and skills close to the needs of the employer. The amount of financial assistance for the unemployed, or the employee involved in the preparation equals 5,700.00 MKD per month plus reimbursement of employers cost for mentoring and trainings. Opting for this change in the law CCM deems that in this way a direct care of the workers in practice will be provided regarding the current trend of blank contractual dismissals. The percentage of salary for officers who partially met their working responsibilities from 30 % decreases to 20 % and for the lowest evaluated officials from 20 % to 10 %. Amendments to the fundamental Law on labor rights of workers have been made through social dialogue and participation of social partners in the Economic and Social Council. Also the inspector may punish the employer, initiate infringement proceedings under provided conditions or to adopt a ban on work in the current premises for a period of 30 days. Especially important is that the law provides that during the ban employers are obliged to paid compensation to these workers in amount of 70 % of the salary and benefits and during the ban the employer must not reduce the number of employees. 0302-004 of 03.01.2014, the Trade union of the workers in Catering, Tourism, Communal and Housing Economy, Handicraft and Protecting Associations of Macedonia, No. Amendments to the law stipulate precisely the rights and thus provide greater protection and safety of seasonal workers. To implement this program 6,200 MKD per person per month will be paid including personal income tax and insurance in case of accidents at work and occupational disease. Number of complaints on separate legal bases Most based on: 187 introduces a provision No. In the frameworks of this meeting a special program for young trade unionists was also presented. On 17 October 2012 the Government adopted a three-year action plan to promote more and better jobs for young people aged between 15 and 29, and in the preparation of the action plan were included the social partners. Training at known employer, in order the registered unemployed to acquire a certain level of knowledge and skills at an employer who has already established certain jobs requirements. social inclusion. The plan is aligned with the National Employment Strategy of the Republic of Macedonia 2015 where youth represents special target group. National Action Plan of Youth Employment 2015 The same is distributed to all affiliated unions in the public sector in CCM which requested written comments regarding the draft legislation to be submitted by 08.01.2014 to the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia and the Ministry of Information Society and Administration. An obligation for the employer to notify in advance the State Labor Inspectorate for each overtime work has been introduced. According to statistics of ESA there are 45,000 people, out of which 25,000 are actively job seekers. Apart from the social contributions the employer will be exempt from paying personal income tax on that person, an opportunity that exists as a legal solution. Based on the continuous monitoring of the implementation of the General Collective Agreement for the private sector of the economy in practice its signatories, CCM and ORM during this year had launched an initiative for its amendment. Target group are all young unemployed people up to 29 years. Also at the request of the unions also in this case for dismissal on grounds of fault of workers the terms originally proposed by the government have been reduced. including programs for education, training of youth in order to improve the employability and The Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia presented information on the given legal protection, latest changes to labor legislation, and national action plan for youth employment in 2015 from which the latest measures for youth employment years have aroused. 0306-1 from 08.01.2014 and the Trade Union of Defense and Security, No. CCM continues with its practice of raising initiatives through the Economic and Social Council to ratify relevant international conventions and in that direction upon trade union request the following conventions have been ratified: Convention on Labor Relations (Public Service) No. 151; Recommendation on Labor Relations (Public Service) No. 159; Convention on Collective Bargaining No. 154. The amendments to the Law introduced a requirement for employers to accurately indicate the beginning and end of working time arrangements for part- time contracts and for the part- time contracts to inform the State Labor Inspectorate once a month. The training enables acquiring and improving the knowledge and skills of registered unemployed persons due to their easier employability. In connection with the initial proposal to increase the limitation periods for the dismissal of workers, the position of CCM was that a too long period of expiration and no distinction has been made regarding the invalidity of dismissal for personal reasons and for reasons of fault. NAPE, together with the National Program for Development of Education 2005 - 2015 requires harmonization of education and training needs of the labor market. The employer will be exempt from paying contributions for pension and disability insurance, health insurance and insurance in case of unemployment. The exemption will be for a period of 12 months with an obligation to keep the person to work for another year. National Action Plan of Employment of Youth (NAPE) focuses on: The amendment of the Labor Law published in Official Gazette No. 25 is aimed at clarification of certain provisions from the law due to inconsistency of such provisions that caused different legal practice in their application. Also the agreement stipulates that on employer level the union elects or appoints representative for information and consultation and also it was determined that OHS representative is elected among employees on a meeting of the representative trade union upon trade union proposal. Additionally, regarding the evaluation of administrative officials for greater transparency of the procedure, a committee has been formed that will conducted the assessment and which includes the administrative officer, a representative of labor organizations in those institutions where unions are established. At the same time the duration of the period during which the salary is reduced from one year is shortened to six months. For all the accepted suggestions and objections a joint press conference of CCM, KSS and MISA was held on which agreed amendments of the draft laws have been elaborated. On the meeting the countries from the region have presented the changes in the work and social legislation in the period between the two meetings of RTUC \"Solidarnost\" from April 2013 to February 2014. Based on the written proposal and discussions on the meetings between CCM and the unions in the public sector affiliated in CCM with the Ministry of Information Society and Administration, the Minister of Information Society and Administration has accepted a larger number of the proposals for the amendments to the Draft Laws. CCM advocates for a complete prohibition of all types and forms of discrimination due to pregnancy, birth and parenting with regard to employment access, working conditions, labor rights and cancellation of employment contract of workers who are in a state of pregnancy or using rights arising from childbirth and parenting. Training Program to meet labor market demands The measure training at known employer comprised 7278 people and 6591 employments have been realized; the measure training for meeting the labor market demands comprised 1036 people and 491 have been employed and the measure internships comprised 1295 people out of which 759 have been employed. This is one of the most important activities of the union in the European integration processes of the state and CCM will continue with this activity in future. Activities of trade unions affiliated to CCM regarding these laws overdue salaries, benefits and allowances - total 2119, In connection with the agreement of the meeting held on 02.01.2014 a Notice and a Request for comments on the Draft Law on public sector employees and the Draft Law on administrative officers, Reg. No. 03 - 06\/ 8 of 01.03.2014 had been submitted. An argumentative and constructive dialogue on both sides have been led in order to align positions on amendments to the GCA which resulted in signing of an agreement on amendments to the GCA (Official Gazette No. 189\/2013). By signing the agreement significant results and benefits to collective bargaining, social dialogue and promotion of workers' rights have been achieved. The most important change contained in the Agreement is that right of annual leave allowance have been regulated for workers in amount of at least 40 % of the average monthly net salary paid in RM in the last 3 months. In addition we present the original texts explained by CCM on the meeting of RTUC \"Solidarnost\": The Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia submitted a Notice of the meeting in MISA regarding TU proposals on the Draft Laws to the Unions affiliated in CCM, Notice No. 0306-8\/11 from 01.08.2014 to continue with the negotiations between MISA on 10.01.2014 and as agreed at this meeting of 11.01.2014 separate meetings held in MISA had representatives from MPS, SOB and SUTKOZ, while the Independent Trade Union of Health, Pharmacy and Social Care of Macedonia on 13.01.2014. Emphasis is placed on the reform of curricula for vocational education and training for including acquiring skills and work -based learning. Amendments published in: Official Gazette No. 13, Official Gazette No. 25, Official Gazette No. 170 and Official Gazette No. 187. 0301-6\/1 from 09.01.2014, the Macedonian Police Union No. Government supports the programs for labor market trainings for unemployed youth and NAPE determined a goal - 60 % of these young people to be employed within six months after the training. Parental leave should not be confused with the right of a birth and motherhood which is mandatory and paid. After this notification and request for comments suggestions and remarks to CCM and MISA the following TUs had submitted: Trade Union of Forestry Wood Industry and Energy of the Republic of Macedonia No. These amendments envisaged more powers of labor inspectors in protecting irregular workers in order to motivate employers to make employment contracts with workers and to report the funds for compulsory social insurance. Notably with the legislative changes it is envisaged the labor inspector when countering unregistered workers to oblige the employer to make an employment contract of indefinite period of time of the unregistered workers and in the next three months the employer not to reduce the number of employees. Also it was agreed the representative of labor organizations in those institutions where unions are established to participate in the committees that implement disciplinary procedures and offenses. Furthermore, NAPE requires introduction of career education in secondary schools and improving the services of the in directing careers. The proposal of trade unions to reduce participation of the superior in the assessment of 75 to 65 % has been adopted and thus to increase the participation of colleagues, associates, clients or administrative officers which would reduce the subjectivity of the assessment. with the amendments to the Labor Law a provision that provides workers protection from abuse or manipulation in mutual consent of employment contracts termination has been regulated, so in that direction with these changes to the law the treaty for termination of employment should contain a signature with full name and surname of the employee and written date of termination of employment by the employee. In many European countries in addition to the paid leave for pregnancy, childbirth and parenting a right to parental leave for child care and spending some time with the child during its development to a certain age has been regulated. Legal protection by the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia For 2014 these three measures are planned to comprise 1670 people. With this agreement CCM through an argumentative dialogue with employers has provided this right to all employees in the private sector of the economy, thus determining the amount of the recourse in GCA in accordance with the Labor Law which is binding for all workers and employers. Practice has showed that in companies where there is no union organizing and collective bargaining workers are not able to exercise this right. This amendment supported by CCM will provide greater security and protection of workers' rights who in this way will be transparent and fully informed about the basic working conditions as well as the most significant right of employment - the amount of the basic salary. Amendments to the law published in the Official Gazette No. 13 have been made with a direct initiative from CCM and aimed to ensure full protection of workers against discrimination based on pregnancy, birth and parenthood. Also further concessions were made regarding the amount and duration of the reduction in salary for poor performance.\t\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430, \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0435\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a. During 2013 four changes to the Labor Law have been made. Funding for such programs is certainly a problem and to solve the lack of adequate funding of active labor market policies (ALMP) NAPE requires part of the income of the insurance in case of unemployment be forwarded to the funding of ALMPs aimed at youth. In this respect changes in the provision governing public posts i.e. with the amendment the employer is obliged in addition to other special conditions to indicate the beginning and end of daily and weekly working hours, the schedule of hours and the amount of the salary for the position for which the employee is required. On 27 and 28 February, 2014 in Terme Tuhelj, Tuheljske Toplice a meeting of the Regional Trade Union Council \"Solidarity\" was held. If the employers pay wage higher than the net average wage they will need to pay the social security contributions of the difference of the average wage paid and the salary. The meeting was not attended by the President of UPOZ, Peco Gruevski and President of SRSVM, Mico Stojanovski although they had been invited and also upon all requests submitted by CCM to UPOZ and SRSVM to be present on the sessions (meetings), the President of UPOZ was addressing CCM in written and had not accepted participation in meetings and submission of proposals and remarks; President of SRSVM had not submitted any response. Opting for regulation of these provisions in the Labor Law CCM takes direct measures and activities to implement Maternity Protection Convention, which was also ratified in the Republic of Macedonia upon initiative and request of CCM. Particularly significant are changes to the law that provide protection to unregistered workers. Setting a parental leave of absence after completion of the pregnancy leave, birth and parenting is an additional right that stipulates participation in the care of the child until a certain age. An agreement about the way of rewarding the performance of administrative officials has been reached who will receive a bonus in amount of \"last paid salary\" which exceeds the possibility of subjectivity in determining the amount of the award since the primary solution envisioned a bonus \"to a salary\". Although most of the above provisions are aimed at the supply side of the labor market, NAPE is taking in consideration the role of the private sector in job creation and employment of young workers. Labor market unit will play a key role in determining the potential growth sectors. In this context during February 2014 through amendments to the Law on Employment and Insurance in Case of Unemployment and the Law on pension and disability insurance, employment to young people up to 29 years has been provided which means that employers in the private sector that will employ young people up to 29 years, registered as unemployed within the Employment Agency will be exempt from paying social contributions in the first year. 170-a which regulates the right to unpaid parental leave of up to 3 months for up to three years of age of the child at least in 3 parts due to a child care. Upon the request of the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia regarding the proposal of the Government a meeting of the Economic - Social Council was held and the trade union proposal of limitation of dismissal due to personal reasons has not changed and the amendments regulated the limitation period for dismissal by workers fault. Conventions and Recommendations For the internship program an announcement has already been published by which a support for registered unemployed up to 29 years of age will be provided in order the unemployed to acquire practical knowledge and skills.",

In truth, the conviction according to which Astrology has a fatalistic approach probably goes back to the time when psychology was in its infancy, when the influence of the unconscious on individual reactions was unknown. The only sin of astrology is that it helps us to discover who we are, our needs, where we are coming from and where we are going as well as where we could be going were we to manage to change our negative character traits. Indeed, if we start from the principle that character creates destiny, then the less awareness of the cause and effect of one\u2019s actions, the more one is slave to one\u2019s instincts and the less one is able to direct one\u2019s life.

The Department for Gender Equality within the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy shall play a key coordinative role and must have the appropriate resources in order to ensure efficient implementation of the legal and political tools\" \u2013 European Commission. As already mentioned, the process of drafting the text of the new Law on Prevention and Protection from Violence against Women and Domestic Violence was transparent and included all relevant stakeholders. Besides by the Working Group of the Human Rights Council, this recommendation was also issued by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). One of the biggest concerns is that no change in the legislation so far has changed the status of women victims of violence and domestic violence, despite the international recommendations Consequently, revision of the national legislation in order to harmonize it with the Istanbul Convention is recommended. Amendments to the Criminal Code are also recommended regarding marital rape and changes in the definition of rape, i.e. deleting the condition for penetration. Besides by the Working Group of the Human Rights Council, this recommendation was also issued by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). In terms of improving the legal framework, the main remark refers to the unrecognized forms of violence against women and girls, and the obstacles women are faced with in getting solutions for temporary protection. Additionally, the new law does not stipulate solutions for the most burning issues \u2013 the right to housing (permanent and\/or temporary) for women-victims. Furthermore, since 2017, the Ministry has increased the budget for supporting the organizations that offer specialized services for women victims of domestic violence. Namely, recommendations were received by the European Commission on the country's progress in the period March 2018-March 2019, from the United Nations following the submittal of the UPR (the Universal Periodic Review) for a period of five years (2013-2017) and from the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for a period of 5 years. \u2013 to ensure that the National Coordination Body against domestic violence has a mandate regarding all forms of gender-based violence against women and that it adopts measures for identifying and combating specific gender-related aspects of domestic violence; In the first half of this year, the Ministry developed and adopted a Methodology for calculating the costs for 6 specialized services for women-victims of violence. One of the biggest concerns is that no change in the legislation so far has changed the status of women victims of violence and domestic violence, despite the international recommendations The situation regarding this issue is alarming, as these developments (or the lack thereof) have a long-term impact on the economic and social status of women, especially the most vulnerable groups, leading to an increased poverty risk in women, their exclusion from social and health insurance, economic instability and an increased risk of exposure to violence. A new Law on Social Protection has been adopted, which does not recognize women victims of domestic violence as a separate vulnerable category and does not stipulate special measures for their financial support. Amendments to the Criminal Code are also recommended regarding marital rape and changes in the definition of rape, i.e. deleting the condition for penetration. Additionally, the improvements include the amendments to the Criminal Code which stipulate increasing the minimum age for common-law marriages from 16 to 18 years, including the changes in the definition of the criminal offence \"hate speech\" by recognizing gender-identity as one of the grounds. The general conclusion is that although the country has noted progress in this area, albeit minor and mostly regarding improvement of the legal framework, the situation with regard to direct assistance and protection of women-victims of domestic violence remains unchanged. In the implementation of the Law on Prevention and Protection from Domestic Violence, special attention should be given to the provision of appropriate support to victims of domestic violence. Moreover, although in 2018 the country opened three new crisis centers for victims of sexual violence in Skopje, Tetovo and Kumanovo, to meet the standards of the Istanbul Convention, additional shelters for victims of sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking will be needed.

Furthermore, the adoption of the National Action Plan for Gender Equality (2018-2020), one chapter of which is dedicated to gender-based violence, as well as the measures undertaken for raising awareness about gender equality and eradicating gender prejudices and stereotypes as one of the most significant reasons behind the violence against women, have also been recognized as progress. deleting the condition for penetration. The preparation process of the new Law on Gender-Based Violence is finished, and the Law is adopted by the Government, but it's still not adopted by the Parliament. The situation regarding this issue is alarming, as these developments (or the lack thereof) have a long-term impact on the economic and social status of women, especially the most vulnerable groups, leading to an increased poverty risk in women, their exclusion from social and health insurance, economic instability and an increased risk of exposure to violence. The harmonization of the Criminal Code with the provisions of the Istanbul Convention is in its initial stage, and no amendments to the Law on Housing have been announced. A new Law on Social Protection has been adopted, which does not recognize women victims of domestic violence as a separate vulnerable category and does not stipulate special measures for their financial support. One of the recommendations refers to intensifying the efforts for strengthening the legal framework for violence against women, including adoption of a definition of gender-based violence and incrimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the Criminal Code. The process of amending the Family Law has not been started yet although was planned to begin in the first half of 2019. One of the main remarks refers to the slow pace of implementing changes and to the need for prioritizing this area and undertaking urgent measures. In terms of improving the legal framework, the main remark refers to the unrecognized forms of violence against women and girls, and the obstacles women are faced with in getting solutions for temporary protection. More specifically, this refers to the protraction and postponement of court proceedings for issuing temporary measures, the absence of a gender-sensitive approach during the proceedings and the absence of mechanisms for monitoring of their conduct. Namely, all three reports recognize and welcome the steps the country has undertaken for improving the legislation through the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul Convention), including the preparation and adoption of the National Action Plan for its implementation (2018-2023). The process of amending the Family Law has not been started yet although was planned to begin in the first half of 2019. \u2013 in the part National Human Right Institutions, the Committee recommends that the State undertakes all necessary steps in order ensure full harmonization of the Ombudsman Office with the principles relating to the status of the national institutions for advancement and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles), taking into account the recommendations of the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions. \u041fo\u0447eTHa > Activities > 31.12.2019: Press Release: Country Progress Regarding the Issue of Violence against Women and Domestic Violence Namely, all three reports recognize and welcome the steps the country has undertaken for improving the legislation through the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul Convention), including the preparation and adoption of the National Action Plan for its implementation (2018-2023).

The preparation process of the new Law on Gender-Based Violence is finished, and the Law is adopted by the Government, but it's still not adopted by the Parliament. The general conclusion is that although the country has noted progress in this area, albeit minor and mostly regarding improvement of the legal framework, the situation with regard to direct assistance and protection of women-victims of domestic violence remains unchanged. Unfortunately, it is still difficult to say that the situation with women-victims of violence and domestic violence has been improved. We call on the competent institutions and the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia to pay due diligence to the problem of violence against women and domestic violence and to urgently start implementing the recommendations of the international bodies in the direction of more successful implementation of the Istanbul Convention. Furthermore, the adoption of the National Action Plan for Gender Equality (2018-2020), one chapter of which is dedicated to gender-based violence, as well as the measures undertaken for raising awareness about gender equality and eradicating gender prejudices and stereotypes as one of the most significant reasons behind the violence against women, have also been recognized as progress. We call on the competent institutions and the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia to pay due diligence to the problem of violence against women and domestic violence and to urgently start implementing the recommendations of the international bodies in the direction of more successful implementation of the Istanbul Convention. A new Law on Social Protection has been adopted, which does not recognize women victims of domestic violence as a separate vulnerable category and does not stipulate special measures for their financial support. Furthermore, since 2017, the Ministry has increased the budget for supporting the organizations that offer specialized services for women victims of domestic violence. The CEDAW Committee notes that \"There is a limited number of shelters available in the member state, despite the high incidence of gender-based violence against women and girls, including domestic violence\"; and that \"women and girls, including women-migrants and refugees, have no access to the referral centers of the victims of sexual violence\". \u2013 adoption of a comprehensive strategy for elimination of all forms of gender-based violence against women, addressing the basic reasons for gender-based violence and high-risk situations for women with disabilities, women in prostitution and women in detention; Namely, recommendations were received by the European Commission on the country's progress in the period March 2018-March 2019, from the United Nations following the submittal of the UPR (the Universal Periodic Review) for a period of five years (2013-2017) and from the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for a period of 5 years. The harmonization of the Criminal Code with the provisions of the Istanbul Convention is in its initial stage, and no amendments to the Law on Housing have been announced.

Freezing the embryos can be recommended for patients with hyperstimulation, inadequate thickness of the endometrium or inadequate hormonal status, reasons that may contribute to reduced implantation of embryos. Frozen eggs are stored in special containers with liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196 degrees. Cryopreservation of egg cells The egg-freezing procedure begins with the in vitro procedure where the patient receives specific hormone therapy so as to obtain more eggs in the same cycle. The success rate is the same for the fresh transfer and transfer of frozen \/ dehydrated embryos. The embryo defrosting method is also fast and easy and allows 90% survival of the embryo. This procedure is present in 50-60% of couples who do in vitro fertilization. Once the eggs are punctured they are removed and collected. Frozen eggs are stored in special containers with liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196 degrees. Under proper laboratory conditions, a proper treatment is carried out and later the eggs are frozen. This process allows quick and safe embryo digestion at -196 \u00b0 C in liquid nitrogen. The main purpose of this procedure is patient not exhibiting again on hormone therapy and anesthesia but to accept a therapy that will allow endometrium with appropriate thickness suitable for embryo transfer. The process of freezing eggs is carried out only for those egg cells mature and of good quality. In practice, the only frozen embryos are the ones with good development and good quality in order to reduce the chances of damage or complete extinction of the embryos in the process of freeze \/ thaw. The frozen embryos are kept in special liquid nitrogen tanks which allow maintenance at a temperature of -196 \u00b0. Once the embryos are frozen they can be stored for an indefinite period under the same conditions, but according to the latest standards it is not recommended to keep the embryos longer than five years. Cryopreservation of eggs is recommended for patients planning delayed parenting without a partner, patients with certain types of cancer or other diseases.

That is the natural form of folic acid in the body that belongs to B group vitamins and is very essential especially during conception, proper development of the fetus during pregnancy and many metabolic processes in the human body. These effects affect the absorption of folic acid and related processes. MegaFolate is a nutritional supplement which contains 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) in the form of glucosaminic acid. It is the base of MegaFolate - every capsule contains 800 \u00b5g 5-methyltetrahydrofolate - the active form of folic acid. It is a natural folic acid from B group in the organism and is very important during conception, proper development of the fetus during pregnancy and many metabolic processes in the body. In certain genetic or hereditary disorders of metabolic disorders and in various physiological loads, the transformation of folic acid into the active form of folate is either not performed properly or is insufficient. 3 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and in the nursing period; One of the most important reactions is the conversion of homocysteine to methionine in the synthesis of S-adenosyl-methionine - an important methyl donor. Two of the most problematic types of MTHFR gene polymorphism are C677T and A1298C. It is a natural folic acid from B group in the organism and is very important during conception, proper development of the fetus during pregnancy and many metabolic processes in the body. Two of the most problematic types of MTHFR gene polymorphism are C677T and A1298C. The natural 5-MTHF in MegaFolate has important advantages over synthetic folic acid - it is well-absorbed even when gastrointestinal pH is changed and its bioavailability is not affected by metabolic defects. MTHFR gene gives instructions for the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme. That is the natural form of folic acid in the body that belongs to B group vitamins and is very essential especially during conception, proper development of the fetus during pregnancy and many metabolic processes in the human body. 3 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and in the nursing period; for the proper synthesis of amino acids, vitamins, minerals and etc. that interact with folic acid; Unlike synthetic folic acid that folate form can reach the blood-brain barrier and is the natural folic acid that cells can recognize. for the proper synthesis of amino acids, vitamins, minerals and etc. that interact with folic acid; Folate is an essential micronutrient and critical cofactor in a variety of metabolic processes. for the proper synthesis of amino acids, vitamins, minerals and etc. that interact with folic acid; for complete blood composition and prevention of anaemia; It is a natural folic acid from B group in the organism and is very important during conception, proper development of the fetus during pregnancy and many metabolic processes in the body. It is very important during the first trimester of pregnancy when ann reduces the risk of brain and spinal cord damages Folate functions as a coenzyme or cosubstrate in mono carbon transfers in the synthesis of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and amino acid metabolism. for the proper synthesis of amino acids, vitamins, minerals and etc. It is very important during the first trimester of pregnancy when ann reduces the risk of brain and spinal cord damages It is a bioactive form which is absorbed in the body and is well recognized by the cells without methylation. One of the most important reactions is the conversion of homocysteine to methionine in the synthesis of S-adenosyl-methionine - an important methyl donor. Another folate depending reaction - methylation of deoxy uridylate into thymidylate during DNA formation is necessary for the proper cell division. The use of 5-MTHF instead of folic acid reduces the risk of hematologic symptoms of deficiency of vitamin B12, reduces the interaction with drugs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase and overcomes metabolic defects caused by polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. MTHFR gene and mutation MTHFR gene gives instructions for the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme. MTHFR gene gives instructions for the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme. It is a bioactive form which is absorbed in the body and is well recognized by the cells without methylation. It is the same form like the one in Mega Folate and which remains naturally in the blood.

        "text":"In the hands of the labourer, it is transformed into revenue which he draws out of the sale of his labour-power, is converted as revenue into means of subsistence and consumed. Or, on the other hand, that what is revenue for the one is capital for another, and that therefore these are but subjective relations. But how, then, the old capital can be replaced when the value of the entire product is consumable in the form of revenue; and how the value of the product of each individual capital can be equal to the value sum of the three revenues plus C, constant capital, whereas the sum of the values of the products of all capitals is equal to the value sum of the three revenues plus 0 \u2014 this appears, of course, as an insoluble riddle and must be solved by declaring that the analysis is completely incapable of unravelling the simple elements of price, and must be content to go around in a vicious circle making a spurious advance ad infinitum. Accordingly, a portion of the profit, therefore of surplus-value and thereby also surplus-product, in which (as concerns value) only newly added labour is represented, serves as an insurance fund. 1) The fundamental relationship of constant and variable capital, hence also the nature of surplus-value, and thereby the entire basis of the capitalist mode of production, are not understood. Evidently, therefore, the value of the constant portion of capital is not reproduced in the annually created value of product, for the wages are only equal to the value of the variable portion of capital advanced in production, and rent and profit are only equal to the surplus-value, the excess of value produced above the total value of advanced capital, which equals the value of the constant capital plus the value of the variable capital. It is completely irrelevant to the problem to be solved here that a portion of the surplus-value converted into the form of profit and rent is not consumed as revenue, but is accumulated. \u2014 By the way we shall see later that Ricardo now refuted Smith\u2019s false analysis of commodity-price, its reduction to the sum of the values of the revenues. The value of each partial product of capital, each individual commodity, contains a portion of value = constant capital, a portion of value = variable capital (transformed into wages for labourers), and a portion of value = surplus-value (later split into profit and rent). In fact, there is always something more than the wages of the labourer contained in the cost-price, and always more than the profits of enterprise in the selling price, for instance, the price of raw materials, often paid to foreign countries. 998.) It is the materialisation of that portion of the total working-day of the labourer in which the value of variable capital and thus the price of labour is reproduced; that portion of commodity-value in which the labourer reproduces the value of his own labour-power, or the price of his labour. A difference between the product of the individual capitalist and that of society exists only in so far as: from the standpoint of the individual capitalist the net income differs from the gross income, for the latter includes the wages, whereas the former excludes them. Back of this still lurks the idea that the profit, or surplus-value in general, is an excess above the value of the commodity, which can only be made by an extra charge, mutual cheating, or gain through selling. This entire portion of constant capital consumed in production must be replaced in kind. In one stage they form a portion of constant capital, in the other they are consumed individually, and thus pass wholly into the revenue. It is therefore immaterial for our discussion whether the entire surplus-value of the commodities, i.e., all the surplus-labour contained in the commodities, is realised in their price or not. Its normal form presupposes wages corresponding to the value of labour-power. Even monopoly rent, in so far as it is not a deduction from wages, i.e., does not constitute a special category, must always indirectly be a part of the surplus-value. If it is not part of the price excess above the price of production of the commodity itself, of which it is a constituent part (as in differential rent), or an excess portion of the surplus-value of the commodity itself, of which it is a constituent part, above that portion of its own surplus-value measured by the average profit (as in absolute rent), it is at least part of the surplus-value of other commodities, i.e., of commodities which are exchanged for this commodity having a monopoly price. (Revue des deux Mondes, 1848, Tome 24, p. This value thus exists in the form of available additional wealth, in short, from the viewpoint of the individual capitalist, in the form of his revenue. That portion of the value of the product, then, which is destined in the course of reproduction to be converted into wages, into revenue for the labourers, first flows back into the hands of the capitalist in the form of capital, or more accurately variable capital. The portion of the product of Class II which must replace its constant capital is consumed in its natural form by the labourers, capitalists and landlords of Class I. They spend their revenue for this product of II. Furthermore, we saw that the same is true of the value of the annual total product of a society. This double process is revealed through the mediation of money circulation. With the exception of the employed but not consumed portion of fixed capital, the value of the gross output, or gross product, equals the value of capital advanced and consumed in production, that is, constant and variable capital plus surplus-value, which resolves itself into profit and rent. On the other hand, wages, which form the third specific form of revenue, are always equal to the variable component part of capital, i.e., the component part which is laid out in purchasing living labour-power, paying labourers rather than in means of labour. (The labour which is paid in the expenditure of revenue is itself paid in wages, profit, or rent, and therefore does not form any value portion of commodities by which it is paid. The consumed product of II is consumed as revenue by I, and the portion of the revenue of I representing an unconsumable product is consumed as constant capital by II. The latter component part of value, B, is counterposed to the former A, in so far as A, under otherwise equal circumstances: 1) never assumes the form of revenue and 2) always flows back in the form of capital, and indeed constant capital. There can, then, be no net produce, because the cost of production, according to M. Say, consists of rent, wages and profits. On page 508 he says: \u2018The value of a product, the value of a productive service, the value of the cost of production, are all, then, similar values, whenever things are left to their natural course.\u2019 For this total labour is divided into necessary labour, by which the labourer creates that value portion of the product with which he is himself paid, that is, his wages, and into unpaid surplus-labour, by which he creates that value portion of the product which represents surplus-value and which is later divided into profit and rent. Here we have the optimism of bourgeois thoughtlessness in the form of sagacity that most corresponds to it. But it is not this change of form which turns it into capital. It is the commodity and its value which now function as capital. However, that the value of the commodity is not paid for \u2014 and only by this means does it become surplus-value \u2014 is quite irrelevant for the materialisation of labour, the value itself. Thus the yarn of the spinner contains a portion of value representing profit for him, Should the weaver buy the yarn, he realises the profit of the spinner, but for himself this yarn is merely a part of his constant capital. Transformation of profit into capital is no more than employing a portion of excess labour to form new, additional means of production. When this is overlooked the impression is created that the revenue of consumers replaces the entire product, i.e., including the constant portion of value. Just as little is the law of value changed by the circumstance that the equalisation of profit, i.e., the distribution of the total surplus-value among the various capitals, and the obstacles which landed property partially (in absolute rent) puts in the way of this equalisation, bring about a divergence between the regulating average prices and the individual values of commodities. Thus, the value of the annual commodity-product, just like the value of the commodity-product produced by some particular investment of capital, and like the value of any individual commodity, resolves itself into two component parts: A, which replaces the value of the advanced constant capital, and B, which is represented in the form of revenue \u2014 wages, profit and rent. Aside from this labour, the labourer performs no labour, and aside from the total value of the product, which assumes the forms of wages, profit and rent, he creates no value. On the other hand, if we leave aside that portion of constant capital which did not pass over into the product, and which therefore continues to exist, although with reduced value, as before the annual production of commodities; in other words, temporarily leaving out of consideration the employed, but not consumed, fixed capital, then the constant portion of advanced capital is seen to have been wholly transferred to the new product in the form of raw and auxiliary materials, whereas a part of the means of labour has been wholly consumed and another part only partially, and thus only a part of its value has been consumed in production. The entire value portion of the annual product, then, which the labourer creates in the course of the year, is expressed in the annual value sum of the three revenues, the value of wages, profit, and rent. Secondly, this is eliminated in the average movement. The price of commodities contains not only an excess over wages, but also over profit, namely, the constant portion of value. For instance, the revenue of the labourers and capitalists of Class I, which produces constant capital, replaces in value and substance the constant capital of the capitalists of Class II, which produces articles of consumption. But even this is an abstraction to the extent that the entire society, on the basis of capitalist production, bases itself on the capitalist standpoint and thereby considers only the income resolved into profit and rent as net income.",

In 70 per cent of the countries, citizens are denied a simple indication of how much is spent by their government on secret items. Those with poor controls include two-thirds of the largest arms importers and half of the biggest arms exporters in the world. According to Dr. Oliver Cover, the principal author of this study, \"this Index shows unequivocally that there is a severe risk of corruption in this sector. These countries accounted for 94 per cent of the global military expenditure in 2011, equivalent to USD 1.6 trillion.",

In addition, there is a significant improvement in social cohesion and inter-ethnic relations. The yield on the country's euro-denominated bonds maturing in July 2023 fell 2 basis points to an all-time low of 3.2 percent at 5:22 p.m. in Skopje, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tevdovski for Bloomberg: Rep. of Macedonia Sees Economy Expanding on Restored Confidence The government plans to change its policy \"toward greater social justice\" and will replace the current 10 percent flat personal tax with a progressive one, Tevdovski said, without giving a time frame for the tax change. We have made considerable progress in terms of political stability, said Tevdovski, a former university professor. Zaev's coalition \u2013 with two parties representing ethnic Albanians \u2013 consolidated its power after local elections on Sunday. With the end of the political crisis, we are already seeing some pickup in economic activity, which will intensify next year, Tevdovski said.

Sustainable Development Sustainable development, as a global concept, poses a challenge for every person, country and the world in general, all with one objective - to ensure continuous improvement of the quality of life, well-being and sustainable development of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The energy intensity of the economy is calculated as the ratio of gross inland energy consumption (in kilos of oil equivalent) to GDP (in constant 2005 euro). Achievement of this aim means creating an economy with full and qualified employment, quality health care, social and territorial cohesion, as well as environmental protection. Therefore, it is the obligation of the present generation to preserve the planet's capacity to support life with its entire diversity, and to ensure sustainable development. The employment rate of older workers is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 55 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group The indicator is based on the Labour Force Survey. The indicators have a multi-domain character and reflect the economic, social, environmental, and, to a certain degree, the institutional dimension of sustainable development. The progress in realizing the defined objectives is monitored trough a set of indicators, defined by the European Commission. Therefore, it is the obligation of the present generation to preserve the planet's capacity to support life with its entire diversity, and to ensure sustainable development.

In 2019, share of LGUs revenues as percentage of GDP in the Republic of North Macedonia accounted for 5.4% (according to the data on GDP revised by the State Statistical Office). Nonetheless, there are exceptions, as well as different models of fiscal decentralization, which also depend on the levels of government, Besimi wrote. Besimi: Economic development is correlated with fiscal decentralization, therefore its strengthening is needed Economic development in most of the transition countries is also usually linked with the increase of the degree of decentralization. Nonetheless, there are exceptions, as well as different models of fiscal decentralization, which also depend on the levels of government, Besimi wrote. Minister of Finance underlines that for the purpose of strengthening the fiscal decentralization, many activities and measures are envisaged, grouped in three pillars: improved fiscal capacity and increased municipal revenues, strengthened fiscal discipline and transparency, and accountability. Compared to the countries in the region, analyzed according to Report of the Network of Associations of Local Authorities in SEE (as per the preliminary data on RNM, its degree of fiscal decentralization is 4.9%), fiscal decentralization is lower in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina (4.5%), Albania (3.6%), Turkey (3.5%) and Slovenia (4.7%), but higher compared to Croatia (7.4%), Montenegro (6.5%) and Kosovo (7.7%). The first pillar, or improved fiscal capacity and increased municipal revenues, will be implemented through activities which envisage increase of the funds distributed to the municipalities on the basis of collected fees in the central Budget, increased own revenues of the municipalities and establishment of funds to support the good performance. \u2013 Building sound and functioning public finance system is the cornerstone for sustainable economic growth. Compared to the countries in the region, analyzed according to Report of the Network of Associations of Local Authorities in SEE (as per the preliminary data on RNM, its degree of fiscal decentralization is 4.9%), fiscal decentralization is lower in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina (4.5%), Albania (3.6%), Turkey (3.5%) and Slovenia (4.7%), but higher compared to Croatia (7.4%), Montenegro (6.5%) and Kosovo (7.7%). He points out that should one analyze the recent available data of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on share of revenues at local level (local government units (LGUs)) in GDP, it can be noted that, as regards Europe, Sweden exhibits the highest share of local revenues in GDP \u2013 16%, followed by Finland and Denmark with 14.79% and 14.12% respectively, Iceland with 11.7% and Norway with 9%. the fiscal capacity of the local government, which, in the case of our country, can be an inverse factor as well to this positive correlation without having the matching local government's capacities. On the other hand, share of LGUs revenues in GDP in the case of Western Balkans is 5.6%, being by 5 percentage points lower compared to the EU average (10.6), Besimi wrote in his article. Minister of Finance underlines that for the purpose of strengthening the fiscal decentralization, many activities and measures are envisaged, grouped in three pillars: improved fiscal capacity and increased municipal revenues, strengthened fiscal discipline and transparency, and accountability. Thus, we propose a reform comprising three pillars aimed at strengthening the fiscal capacity of the municipalities, their cost-effective operations and increased transparency, Minister of Finance, Fatmir Besimu, wrote in his article dedicated to fiscal decentralization.

As Besimi wrote in the article, for the purpose of increased transparency and accountability, i.e. within the third pillar of strengthening the fiscal decentralization, government oversight will be enhanced, in particular by the Department for Public Sector Financial Inspection in terms of the Law on Reporting and Recording Liabilities and reporting non-compliance with the Law on Financial Discipline, measures will be adopted with respect to increased transparency at the municipalities by announcing the financial reports in a transparent and understandable manner, and activities will be undertaken for the purpose of strengthened accountability when using budget funds.

Thus, we propose a reform comprising three pillars aimed at strengthening the fiscal capacity of the municipalities, their cost-effective operations and increased transparency, Minister of Finance, Fatmir Besimu, wrote in his article dedicated to fiscal decentralization. The second pillar, aimed at strengthening the financial discipline of the municipalities, arrears repayment and cost-effective operations, envisages activities aimed at measures for planning the actual revenues and expenditures of the municipalities, rationalizing the operations and reducing the unnecessary expenditures, regular servicing of arrears, strengthened financial discipline, procedures on declaring financial instability, issuance of municipal bonds and analysis of the existing arrears of both the municipalities and the public enterprises.

Nonetheless, there are exceptions, as well as different models of fiscal decentralization, which also depend on the levels of government, Besimi wrote. 21st March 2021, Skopje \u2013 Fiscal decentralization has significant influence on the economic development, i.e. developed countries exhibit, on average, higher level of fiscal decentralization compared to the developing countries.",

Kuma's buildings are often deceptively simple and make use of ancient materials, especially wood. Kuma is tall, informal \u2013 he was wearing stonewashed jeans, and a striped T-shirt under a nylon jacket with frayed and shredded shoulders \u2013 and he greeted me with a quick handshake, as if I were another employee. Kuma's design for the Fujiya ryokan \u2013 his take on the traditional Japanese inn \u2013 at Ginzan Onsen, a secluded hot spring town in Yamagata Prefecture, north of Tokyo. The interior of Fujiya ryokan. Kuma's Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center in Tokyo, which is 128 feet tall and was built in 2012. Rejecting flashy forms in favor of buildings in harmony with their environment, the architect \u2013 poised to become world famous for his stadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo \u2013 is trying to reinvent his entire trade. Speaking to me about the building in October, in the glassed-in penthouse library above his firm's Tokyo offices, Kuma became animated. KENGO KUMA'S FASCINATION with architecture began when he was 10 years old and his father took him to visit Kenzo Tange's famous Yoyogi National Gymnasium, constructed for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Many of his notable works are in rural areas and serve an ostensibly minor purpose \u2013 say, to exhibit a collection of Hiroshige woodblock prints, or to sell Taiwanese pineapple cakes, or to house a Starbucks in the city of Fukuoka, known equally for its ancient temples and shopping malls. Tange treated natural light like a magician, he said, discussing the way the panels on the ceiling reflected light bouncing off the swimming pool. He is the most famous Japanese architect Americans have never heard of, mostly due to his sparse record of building outside of East Asia; he has only one public commission in the United States, a \"cultural village\" for the Japanese Garden, Ore., whose most notable structure is a small glass box of a teahouse cantilevered past a single post, making it appear to float above a ravine. And yet Tange's work \u2013 aggressively modern, wresting enormous form out of space, deploying the latest synthetic materials, an imposition on the landscape and an attention-grabbing demonstration of what architecture could do in a city that only 20 years earlier had been comprehensively destroyed by American bombs \u2013 could not be further from Kuma's own aesthetic. But he grew noticeably excited speaking about Tange's gymnasium. Tange's arena \u2013 with its high mast and violently sloping roof, its form like a discus emerging obliquely from the earth \u2013 was a masterpiece of engineering, and remains the most breathtaking example of Japanese Modernism. I had only met him a few minutes earlier, in the cramped main quarters, when he swiftly emerged from his tiny, cubicle-like space in the far corner.

In Bloomington, Rector Dika and Pro-Rector Goodspeed held meetings with the Vice President of Indiana University, David Zaret, who is also a board member of SEEU and Prof. Venkataramanan from the IU Provost office. These meetings concluded successful cooperation between these two institutions of higher education, emphasizing the necessity of deepening this cooperation. This was a unique experience of merging theory and practice of most current cases, always based on results from scientific researches for transmitting knowledge and competences which open new paths for managing with institutions, said after his return from Harvard, Rector Dika. Moreover, in Bloomington an important meeting with the Dean of the Kelley Business School (ranked in the top 25 higher education institutions in the global ranking), Prof. Idalene K. and executive director of the Global MBA Program, Prof. M. Richard, with whom SEEU is implementing a joint program in Master of Business Administration (MBA), where one semester is accomplished by this prestigious business school has been realized. In particular, is needed to be stressed the meeting with SEEU's friend, Dean of the School of Informatics & Computing, Prof. Mathew Palakal and other Representatives of this globally recognized school. Series of meetings in Bloomington continued with the Director of International Programs and institutes with whom the intensification of relations are expected to occur including the exchange of students and staff. SEEU's Rector Prof. Dr. Zamir Dika successfully completed the Harvard University Executive Program For the executives of various institutions from 23 countries that were part of this program, a great opportunity to closely analyse contemporary models of financial management was offered, using the most advanced techniques of financial analysis based on case studies, said SEEU's Rector, Prof. Dr. Zamir Dika, after returning from Harvard (USA). For executive representatives of different institutions from 23 countries which were part of this program, an excellent opportunity for analysing contemporary models of financial management, using the most advanced technique of financial analysis based on case studies was offered. According to Rector Dika, for South East European University this is another opportunity to advance its own unique model in the region and to explore new ways of strengthen its international presence. In Indianapolis a meeting with the Chancellor of the Indiana University, Purdue(IUPUI), Prof. Charles R. B. and his deputy Prof. Gil L., has been realized which has given positive feedback and opinion for the progress that SEEU has made during this period, whereby Rector Dika thanked them for their continued support. Legend (photo): Executive representatives of various institutions from 23 countries that were part of the program \"Finance for Senior Executives\" in Harvard Business School . For Prof. Palakal, we can freely say that he is the creator of the computer science program at the SEEU and he has consistently pursued the development of this program, says Rector Dika, adding that in this meetings were discussed ways in how to increase the level of cooperation in the field of scientific research, bearing in mind that some SEEU staff members have completed master and doctoral studies at this faculty and now is offered the opportunity to compete together in joint research projects and the possibilities for student and staff exchange.",

I learned a lot about international football within seconds of the start of that game against Italy when Chiellini took me out about three seconds after I played the ball, Kane told me for Rabona magazine. We've been fortunate enough to play against Tottenham so I know him well.\" Six years on from his baptism of fire, Kane and Chiellini, now captains of their respective countries, will lock horns again in the final of the European Championship. A key battle of the Euro 2020 final will be between the captains, England's Harry Kane and Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. Kane is a player I have always liked a great deal, Chiellini said this week after England's semifinal victory over Denmark. He knows better than most the scale of Kane's ability, and the Italian will be relishing the chance to lock horns with Kane. The latest installment of their long-running rivalry has more at stake than ever. His contest with Kane will be one of the individual contests that will decide the final. His game-clinching free kick for Tottenham Hotspur against Aston Villa in 2014, which convinced his then-manager, Mauricio Pochettino, to promote him to the starting lineup, is one. Rewarded with a start following his scoring cameo four days earlier in that game against Lithuania, Kane went toe-to-toe with one of the finest defenders in the world. It didn't go particularly well for the Englishman. He knows better than most the scale of Kane's ability, and the Italian will be relishing the chance to lock horns with Kane. England's Harry Kane (left) and Italy's Georgio Chiellini (right) meet again in the Euro 2020 final His game-clinching free kick for Tottenham Hotspur against Aston Villa in 2014, which convinced his then-manager, Mauricio Pochettino, to promote him to the starting lineup, is one. One of those was his first England start, against Italy in Turin on the final day in March 2015. Even after he failed to score in England's first three group games \u2014 the Three Lions scored just two goals combined \u2014 it's somewhat remarkable that some England fans still doubt Kane. But he learned from it. In 2018, Kane's Tottenham would meet Chiellini's Juventus in a Champions League double header. England's Harry Kane (left) and Italy's Georgio Chiellini (right) meet again in the Euro 2020 final There have been a few moments in Harry Kane's career that have bookmarked his ascent.

Several countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Russia and the Czech Republic have sent rescue teams to help with the search.

Germany's Federal Agency for Technical Relief said at least eight German nationals were injured in the disaster, while the Netherlands confirmed that the Dutch Ambassador to Lebanon and his wife were among the wounded. Even residents in the city's outskirts reported hearing the blast, with some saying their windows were shattered. The site of the explosion in Beirut What caused the explosion? The cause of the first explosion has yet to be confirmed. Experts have suggested that fireworks could have been involved, though Lebanese officials did not indicate that was the cause of the first explosion. Online videos of the disaster showed a dark cloud with sparks and lights inside after the first blast, before a much larger explosion shook the Lebanese capital. According to Germany's geosciences center GFZ, the second explosion struck with a force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake. It is unacceptable that a shipment of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate has been present for six years in a warehouse, without taking preventive measures, Diab said.

The building did not collapse after 30 minutes of being on fire, but the flames have damaged the walls, roof and many icons from the church. To put the fire out, it took 60 firemen and women, while three of them received light injuries during the blaze. \"We were very surprise of the intensity of the fire, the building collapsed very fast. Today, another Orthodox Monastery in Russia also had a fire. The police are conducting an investigation into the fire, some of the Australian media say there is a possibility of arson, because the church had a lot of money after Easter donations were given to the church. The Serbian Orthodox church in Manhattan, New York, St Sava was completely destroyed in the fire, there were no fatalities or injured. Fire in four different Orthodox Churches on Easter day Just a few hours earlier a fire broke out in the oldest Orthodox Church in Melbourne. The cause here, is also unknown, however investigations and inquiries are being conducted. The fire began in the Macedonian Orthodox Church of the Resurrection of Christ at 22:00 local time, luckily, no-one was in the building at the time.

At the start of the 2019\/2020 school year, students from the secondary school \"Kole Nehtenin\" from Stip organized a humanitarian action for donating funds to the State Secondary School for Education and Rehabilitation \"Iskra\". The young people from Stip with a humanitarian action I had fun \u2013 at the beginning we played games in order to get to know each other better and become friends, and then, we focused more on the play. Immediately after that we will visit the Mayor and ask for support from the Municipality and, together with their assistance, we will try to organize a concrete action\", added the teachers Zaklina Atova and Vilma Ilievska. We choose the society in which we will live, we should be responsible and aware of that\", said Slavica. It is very important for the students in our school to feel accepted\", says Atanasova. We decided to donate the funds to the SSS Iskra\", because we believed that they needed them the most. The play \"Together in the Future\" was the final result of the several months' participation of around thirty students from \"Kole Nehtenin\" in creative workshops, supported by the USAID Youth Ethnic Integration Project. We need to raise the environmental awareness both in young and older people. It is important for young people to participate in these activities, to help other children and people that need help, to volunteer\", said Slavica. Unfortunately, students with special educational needs are rejected and discriminated in our society. Often we stayed after later because we had fun, we all built strong friendships.

Slavica Ivanovska, a student in the secondary school \"Kole Nehtenin\" from Stip The students discussed the real problems in their city and the possible manners to overcome them. We called it \"Together in the Future\" because we wanted to send a message that we are all equal. They raised the funds by selling various food products that they themselves prepared and sold during the play that they performed at the end of the previous school year. There were more than 100 guests in the audience \u2013 parents, teachers and students from all schools in Stip. This was my first time participating in such an activity and I would like to have more such activities in the school in the future\", said Slavica.

The program for educating women in performing breast self-examination in order to prevent breast cancer is designed and developed by \"Acibadem Sistina\" Hospital, in collaboration with non-governmental organizations. Since this area of the human body is delicate and significant, the surgeons' experience, the collaborative team environment and the use of up-to-date medical equipment are all particularly important in minimizing risks as well as in increasing the overall success rate. Thoracic surgery is a medical field of surgical treatment of diseases affecting the thoracic (chest) organs such as: lungs, diaphragm, esophagus, tumor structures of the chest wall and the mediastinal tumors, as well as all congenital chest wall anomalies. Thoracic Surgery The Department performs over 1,000 surgical interventions annually, leading in the number of successfully performed breast interventions. In addition to surgeons, these consultations include specialists in the field of anesthesiology, pulmonology, radiology, pathology, oncology, radiotherapy and nuclear medicine. MULTIDISCIPLINARY ACCESS The experienced surgical team supported by specialists from the departments of X-ray diagnostics, pathohistology, nuclear medicine, and by colleagues from respected branches of the Internal Medicine Unit, enables all necessary diagnostic procedures. Thyroid Gland Surgery The department provides standardized high technology in the implementation of the diagnostic and therapeutic protocol in treating each patient individually. Considering the generalized nature of atherosclerosis, the treatment of these patients is carried out through a collaborative team approach of colleagues from the departments of cardiology, radiology, anesthesiology, blood transfusion etc. Besides the classical surgical approach these surgical interventions are performed in a minimally invasive video-assisted manner, which is particularly important since the period of rehabilitation is shortened, the post-operative pain is reduced and better aesthetic results are achieved. Vascular surgery is a specialization which treats diseases of the blood vessels i.e. arteries and veins. Today, lung carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies encountered in everyday practice. The department is therefore led by one of the most experienced surgeons in this area in our country. Breast Surgery Vascular interventions are performed free of charge for HIFM insurers. The Breasts Cancer Centre holds consultative meetings of leading experts in the field of X-ray diagnostics, tumor and reconstructive surgery, diagnostic histopathology and oncology, thus thoroughly covering the complete diagnostics, surgical reconstruction and oncological care of all types of breast cancer. The Thoracic and Vascular Surgery Department is headed by Dr. Mitko Karagjozov, the most experienced surgeon in this field in our region.

As a comparison, in 2012, there were 146.4 passenger vehicles per 1.000 citizens which is a sign that the number of citizens that own one or more vehicles is constantly rising.

        "text":"Chemotherapy is often used as a complement to the surgery and the treatment with radiotherapy. The clinical examination implies a range of diagnostic procedures such as examination of the pharynx (oropharyngeal screening), examination of the larynx and vocal cords with rigid or flexible endoscope (laryngoscopy), palpation of the neck and radiological examinations of the neck (ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging). There are two treatment approaches for the laryngeal cancer: surgery and radiotherapy. Consuming alcohol, especially when combined with smoking, increases the risk of developing the disease by up to 40 times. If the tumor is big and is detected too late, it will be necessary to remove the entire larynx (total laryngectomy). Men are diagnosed with this type of cancer 4-10 times more often than women. Depending on the results of the histological analysis, the patient is advised for further treatment. There are functional laryngectomies in which the tumor and a part of the larynx is removed (partial horizontal and vertical laryngectomy). The laryngeal cancer is diagnosed by an ENT specialist on the basis of several diagnostic procedures. Surgery and radiotherapy Depending on the size and location of the tumor, the surgery can be functional by removing only the tumor with part or all of the vocal cord (chordectomia). If an occurrence of laryngeal cancer is suspected, because of the histopathological diagnosis of change, in short-term anesthesia and biopsy, a direct laryngoscopy with video laryngoscope or operating microscope is recommended. Sometimes the tumor may be so big that it does not allow a surgical treatment and in those cases the only way of treatment is radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The risk of this type of cancer is 5-25 times higher for smokers. The type and the scope of surgery depends on the position and the size of the cancer, as well as the progression of the disease. First symptom, hoarseness If the cancer spreads to the lymph nodes, a swelling appears on the neck. Diagnosis The tumor is usually located on the chords and the first sign is the change of the voice quality and hoarseness. Other symptoms are ear or throat ache. In advanced cases difficulty breathing, pain when swallowing, as well as bloody sputum can also be noticed.",

He made a comparison of the previous Census law and the current Census Law and highlights two key moments. To damage the process it takes very little, but to carry out the process with credibility, it takes a lot of work from all stakeholders, so we organize this debate to raise awareness\", said the Rector Bexheti. There is a fierce war for numbers in the Balkans, therefore it is our national obligation to register and to call on our relatives and acquaintances to register massively and to verify our presence said Prof. Pajaziti. I am deeply convinced that this process cannot be just a technical operation, as it produces legal and constitutional effects, said Rector Bexheti. Census is not just a statistical operation as it produces legal and constitutional effects - SEEU Debate on Census of Population in RNM Regarding the challenges of registration, Rector Bexheti drew attention to the registration of internal migration and the possibility of double registration. The debate was also attended by representatives of the Student Parliament and Association, as well as other students who asked questions and gave opinions on the topic. The current Census Law has a more advanced legal basis than that of 2011, noted Prof. Shasivari. In capacity of a communication expert Prof. Dr. Demush Bajrami, spoke about the aspect of sending reliable information to citizens, so that there is no misinformation and disinformation that would harm this process. I am not saying that now there is more confidence, but with the new law protection mechanisms have been created, such as the signing mechanism concluded between the director and deputy-director of the State Statistical Office, whereas in the previous law the Albanian representatives did not have the right of veto. Prof. Dr. Ali Pajaziti, spoke about the social aspect of the census, which is taking place in the context of a divided or fragile society. The main panelists of the debate were Prof. Dr. Jeton Shasivari, Prof. Dr. Demush Bajrami and Prof. Dr. Ali Pajaziti. We need to make a wide publicity in the mainstream media and on social networks for the census as a very important and necessary moment for the further developments in the state itself said Prof. Bajrami. The organization of this debate was in function to raise the awareness of citizens to participate in the census in the most organized and massive way. The debate was organized on the initiative of the SEEU Rector, Acad. Prof. Dr. Abdylmenaf Bexheti, who gave an introductory speech and spoke about the registration as an extremely important process. Prof. Dr. Jeton Shasivari, said that by organizing this debate, we as a University prove that we are where social processes take place. At the South East European University in Tetovo, today (11.03.2021), a public debate was held on the census process in the Republic of North Macedonia, on the topic: \"The need to raise public awareness on the census in the Republic of North Macedonia\" \".",

        "text":"Covid-19 Passports Were not Planned 7 Months Before the Wuhan Pandemic Broke Out The fact that the EC planned to introduce such an integrated digital system at the European level does not mean that these vaccine passports were \"Covid-19 passports\". Simply put, if Covid-19 did not appear, then these vaccine passports would contain information about other vaccines of EU citizens in electronic form. The Recommendation also welcomes the Commission's intention to examine the feasibility of developing a common vaccination card\/passport that would be compatible with electronic immunisation information systems and recognised for use across borders. Covid-19 passports that are served to us today, as the only way to open the borders, were actually planned in advance with aim to control the human population \u2013 A NECESSARY PANDEMIC! The document reads: The claim made in the post we are reviewing that the Covid-19 passports were planned in advance with the aim to control the human population and that a \"necessary pandemic\" was created is false and manipulative. Given all of the above, we evaluate the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine passports were planned 2 years before the pandemic and that the Covid-19 pandemic was \"invented\" as disinformation and manipulation. How could that be the case? Even if there were a European integrated vaccination passport system, it does not mean that it depopulates the Earth or that a pandemic is planned. A vaccine passport in 2018, in the context of documents published by the European Commission, is not the same as a Covid-19 passport in 2021. The vaccine passport planned in 2018 refers to different vaccination schedules of EU member states, i.e. vaccines that existed at that time. And this is the main problem. A Facebook post claims that Covid-19 passports were planned 7 months before the Wuhan pandemic broke out. It does not say that these are Covid-19 vaccines, but all vaccines in general. They did not even bother to remove the documents, because they know that the majority of people are in front of the TVs and few are investigating. There is no evidence that the development of a European Vaccine Information Sharing System at the EU level is a \"pandemic plan or depopulation plan\". Covid-19 is neither mentioned nor can be mentioned in this document, because the virus and the pandemic did not exist in 2018. However, the truth is quite different. This is summary information from a meeting of the eHealth Network, held on 13 November 2018. The document that is linked and quoted in the text does not mention vaccination with a passport, which is a Covid-19 passport. They know that there are idiots, who blindly believe them, and this text with documents and evidence will be declared FAKE NEWS and they will say: No, the EC DOCUMENT is not proof that the pandemic is planned, \u2013 reads the post and a link from an article published on a portal is provided. So, in the passport that was planned in 2018, a Covid-19 vaccine was not planned to be administered, because then there was no coronavirus and Covid-19 pandemic worldwide. (COVID-19 PASSPORTS PLANNED 7 MONTHS BEFORE THE WUHAN PANDEMIC BROKE OUT). Simply put, two years before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the European Commission planned to integrate vaccination information for EU citizens into an electronic system that could be used for travelling. Given all of the above, we evaluate the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine passports were planned 2 years before the pandemic and that the Covid-19 pandemic was \"invented\" as disinformation and manipulation. The two things are separate and unrelated. What was planned in 2018 by the European Commission is, in fact, a vaccine passport that is not related to Covid-19 at all, but to any vaccine, in order to electronically connect the systems with health data for the citizens more easily, in order to integrate and facilitate the flow of passengers at EU level. The document is published on the website of the European Commission and it says that the recommendation envisages the development of a European Vaccine Information Sharing System (EVIS). Even if there were a European integrated vaccination passport system, it does not mean that it depopulates the Earth or that a pandemic is planned. Another disinformation is the fact that the vaccine passports that were the idea in 2018, mean that the pandemic is planned.",

However, in his interview, Patriarch Eirinaios claims that he never signed or empowered the sale of Patriarchal real estate and he accused the arch-secretary of not acting properly. RAMALLAH (AFP) - Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei held talks yesterday with the beleaguered Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, who pledged to cooperate with any probe into charges that the Patriarchate sold land to Jewish investors. On the disputable illegal actions that burden the Greek Patriarchate of Jerusalem (04.04.2005) The properties of the Church in Jerusalem and properties of mosques in Jerusalem all belong to the Palestinian people and we are worried about any measures being taken that undermine this. Speaking to Ethnos tis Kiriakis newspaper, the Patriarch of Jerusalem rejected allegations that he sold Patriarchal real estate to Israeli businessmen and ruled out the possibility of resigning. I was sent Vavilis by Athens, by the Archbishop, stressed the Patriarch of Jerusalem, noting that the man with the thousand faces never gave him rights or knew his nature. Patriarch Bartholomew, as the highest ranking Orthodox leader, can convene a Synod at the request of the Synod of the Patriarchy of Jerusalem, in order to examine any misdemeanours on the part of Patriarch Eirinaios or ways out of the crisis. At the same time, Patriarch Eirinaios once again connected Archbishop Christodoulos with Apostolos Vavilis. The agreement regards the sale of lands in Jerusalem in order to build a security wall, which brought 156,000 euros. At the same time, the agreement signed in Jerusalem on 17 August 2004 by the representative of the Israeli Ministry of Defence and by Nikos Papadimas of the Patriarchy of Jerusalem was published by the newspaper Apogevmatini tis Kiriakis . The matter was discussed yesterday in a meeting in Istanbul between Greece's deputy foreign minister, Panayiotis Skandalakis, and Ecumenical Patriarch Vartholomaios, head of the world's Orthodox Christians.] The situation that has arisen recently in the Patriarchy of Jerusalem has demanded my presence in Istanbul and my meeting with the Ecumenical Patriarch, stated Mr Skandalakis after the meeting, and he went on to conclude: \"the Greek government supports all the Patriarchies, but it does not impose its opinions.\" In the meantime, tensions ran high in Jerusalem, when Arab faithful jeered Patriarch Eirinaios during Sunday Mass. [In an interview with the Eleftheros Typos daily on Saturday, Irenaios insisted he was innocent and rejected calls to resign. At the same time, the agreement signed in Jerusalem on 17 August 2004 by the representative of the Israeli Ministry of Defence and by Nikos Papadimas of the Patriarchy of Jerusalem was published by the newspaper Apogevmatini tis Kiriakis . Our position is very clear.\t\u041d\u0430\u0448\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0448\u043d\u0435 \u0458\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430. At the same time, Patriarch Eirinaios once again connected Archbishop Christodoulos with Apostolos Vavilis. I met with the patriarch to clarify things, said Qorei. I would be na\u00efve to betray the Holy Sepulchre, stated Patriarch Eirinaios, and blamed the accusations on personal interests of certain people, including church fathers. RAMALLAH (AFP) - Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei held talks yesterday with the beleaguered Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, who pledged to cooperate with any probe into charges that the Patriarchate sold land to Jewish investors. The patriarch confirmed that he did not issue any authorization for sales or long leases... [and] that there was not any sale.\" At the same time, in an interview to a Sunday newspaper, Patriarch Eirinaios repeated that there is no question of his resigning, and that Vavilis was sent to the Patriarchy by Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens.

This today was a crucible for your character, endurance, patience, perseverance and fortitude. Are you aware how different you are from your peers? When i gather all the thought that pass in a few seconds through my mind, i understand how privileged and unique we are that are members of this dojo. You trained exposed to the cold fall wind. After the seminar ended, he on the Forum of the dojo posted this text: All that knowledge gained in this way remains forever 'stuck' to You. A seminar has been held on the topic of: Shurikenjutsu How many of them had their hearts warmed by the fireplace in the dojo? Some left with 'embedded' warrior characteristics and traits, while some forgot what the dojo made out of them and for them. That you have chosen the best path? On those fifty seminars and almost ten years of my membership in the dojo, in attendance were a lot of kid. I want to express my gratitude for Sensei for again (as always) maximally truing to convey all that he can in those few hours, and also for the new details about the techniques. Training inside the dojo and outside of it is not the same and i am glad that you felt that for a little bit. Do you know how many kids grew up running through the leafs in the yard? Do you know that on those tatamis are laid all the pure souls of our youngest members and that for them there is no greater satisfaction that the chance to grow amongst true Warriors? Some left, few stayed and in some way each chose his own way. Yesterday in the yard of the Homby Dojo of the Organization \"Taiyou e no Michi\" a seminar was held on which the instructor Igor Dovezenski schooled his students on the ninjutsu skill of throwing metal blades, otherwise known under the name shuriken.",

She was talking about money, about SIM-cards. In Macedonia a developed network of juvenile prostitution exists which is not only situated in Stip. However the discovery of the cases goes with difficulty because the children that are abused do not have the courage to report their pimps or users of sexual services say experts in this field. People from Stip are disgusted by the information that the number of people who paid for sex with the two girls who at that time had less than 13 years age, has increased. Registered five crimes showing pornographic material to a minor who is still not at the age of fourteen and four crimes for rape as well as a sexual intercourse with a disabled person. Police reveilles that the arrested were: businessmen's, intellectuals and people from other fields. The investigation found that the two pimps of the minor girl's eight-graders organized meetings for them with the customers and taxi transport to reach the designated place. Apparently she went with her friends. According to Natalya Panova, director of the Center for Social Work in Stip there are no elements for initiating proceedings against the families of both juveniles. J (32) form Kumanovo, A. There are still fresh memories of Madame Vaska, Bate Vane, and Brother Saso... They are nice and shy girls. Half of them were minors and gave sexual services to clients from Stip and eastern Macedonia. They took the girls for weekends in Ohrid where events began to unfold. Instead of 9h she would return home before midnight. Sociologists appeal that those children which were victims of juvenile prostitution urgently need to be removed from the environment that left a mark on them so that they may be able to lead a relatively normal life. For sex services customers paid 1.000 to 5.000 denars. Stip police continue the investigation of juvenile prostitution and expect more arrests. Then in Stip several chains of prostitution and several networks of prostitution were discovered. The mother of one of the girls yesterday spoke in public to discharge the rumours and lie's that it was not true that someone offered them money or they asked to remain silent about the case. Criminal charges are brought against them for sexual assault on a minor who hasn't even turned fourteen. On several occasions, I found money in her purse, usually up to 500 denars. From 1.000 to 5.000 denars - This last month I noticed some strange conversations my daughter made on the phone. The police action arrested two girls from Stip that were the minor's pimps which lead them to prostitution and found clients for them. One time by force I took her mobile and heard an adult man as saying: \"Say, doll. No longer is he among the living as well as one of the minor girls caught in the network of prostitution. Sometimes for three thousand dinars, sometimes for a bucket of cheese or bag of flour, depending on the agreement the pimp made with the client. Stip police investigation continues with juvenile prostitution and expects more arrests. The parents of one of the girls say that there child was not neglected, she had as much money as her peers. It turned out she was in Ohrid. \u0427\u0438TajTe \u0444oHeTck\u0438 Dictionary - \u041fper\u043be\u0434 Ha \u0434eTa\u043beH pe\u0447H\u0438k Psychologists, pedagogues and social workers in Stip stress that society, will barley improve with these problems until the economic and social situation improves. Now we are under severe stress and we well do anything to help them overcome this bad experience - said the mother. All of them had sexual services with the two 14 year old girls from Stip. Some of them served the sentence and one of the suspected fielded abroad immediately after the verdict. The police on Saturday arrested M. According to the police the two girls from Stip from January to July this year on several occasions organized meetings for the juveniles. The convict of pedophilia form the Stip village Krupiste these days hanged himself in Stip jail. After the arrest and detention five days ago of businessmen's P. I (42) from Stip, yesterday in the network of juvenile prostitution another six were caught. -We have potential to deal with problems. One of the detainees was having an affair with one of the suspected businessman's. T (63) from Kocani and merchant K. According to MIA from the first six months of this year registered were 41 crimes that were made over 43 minors and 48 persons were arrested. Recently she started going out more often than usual. The sexual services are usually made and given in the catering facilities, in cars or apartments to those suspected of pedophilia. They complain that in public the most exploited are the actions of the children rather than those of the instigators and adults which have sexually abused minors- Panova said. The First Children's Embassy,,Megjahi\" said that it is overwhelming how in most cases the parents know about the prostitution of their child and in a way approve of it. In their chain ten girls from Stip, Kocani, Vinica were involved. We reported to the police. The investigative judge of the detainees gave them custody of 30 days. After the last clarification of the pedophile network in Stip, the Center for Social Work said that in cooperation with the police and other authorities they will take the necessary measures to protect the victims. The pimps are in jail. She said that the money was her friends. T (39) form Kocani and M. The parents of both girls say that in the last mouth they have recognized strange behaviours with their daughters. Then events began to unfold.",

Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.(K) 17 For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.(L) 18 Therefore consider carefully how you listen. 52 Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning(AP) for her. 44 She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak,(AH) and immediately her bleeding stopped. \u201cShe is not dead but asleep.\u201d(AQ) 53 They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. 54 But he took her by the hand and said, \u201cMy child, get up!\u201d(AR) 55 Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. 49 While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader.(AN) \u201cYour daughter is dead,\u201d he said. 13 Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. When he said this, he called out, \u201cWhoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\u201d(E) \u201c\u2018though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.\u2019[a](G) 11 \u201cThis is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.(H) 12 Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. 45 \u201cWho touched me?\u201d Jesus asked. Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman(AE) 40 Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. 41 Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader,(AF) came and fell at Jesus\u2019 feet, pleading with him to come to his house 42 because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. 33 When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake(AA) and was drowned. 50 Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.\u201d 26 They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes,[b] which is across the lake from Galilee. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up. 6 Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. 4 While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: 5 \u201cA farmer went out to sow his seed. 43 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding(AG) for twelve years,[c] but no one could heal her. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus\u2019 feet,(AB) dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. 51 When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James,(AO) and the child\u2019s father and mother. 8 After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God.(B) The Twelve were with him, 2 and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene)(C) from whom seven demons had come out; 3 Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod\u2019s(D) household; Susanna; and many others. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. 30 Jesus asked him, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \u201cLegion,\u201d he replied, because many demons had gone into him. So he got into the boat and left. 47 Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. 48 Then he said to her, \u201cDaughter, your faith has healed you.(AL) Go in peace.\u201d(AM) 27 When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, \u201cWhat do you want with me,(X) Jesus, Son of the Most High God?(Y) I beg you, don\u2019t torture me!\u201d 36 Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed(AC) man had been cured. 37 Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them,(AD) because they were overcome with fear. \u201cStop wailing,\u201d Jesus said. 24 The disciples went and woke him, saying, \u201cMaster, Master,(S) we\u2019re going to drown!\u201d He got up and rebuked(T) the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.(U) 25 \u201cWhere is your faith?\u201d he asked his disciples. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.\u201d(M) 34 When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, 35 and the people went out to see what had happened.",

It is the perfect destination to escape from civilization and merge with natural and spiritual. Such a combination offers an exciting Treskavec. Anchored between the stone confines of Zlatovrv, 1,280 meters above sea level, this place leaves no one indifferent, mostly because of unique natural beauty, but also because of the mystique ancient stories and the peace and tranquility of the namesake monastery complex. Free flight is an exciting experience itself, but when you combine the adrenaline with the beautiful place, which you fly over it, you get an unforgettable experience. From Treskavec you can see the Pelagonija valley, the mountains Babuna, Pelister, Kajmakcalan, and at night the lights of the cities Bitola, Prilep and Krusevo.",

The police filed criminal charges against him yesterday for parental sexual abuse for which a criminal charge awaits ranging from 5-10 years. It is suspected that in 2009 he used force to sexually abuse his minor daughter, who he had from his first marriage. The father defends himself and says that it is about revenge. Gostivar- - The padlock on the iron door of the high concrete fence of the house of the man from Gostivar is suspected of raping his daughter for two years. House locked 2 years after the incest ocuredUtrinski vesnik, No. 3589 \u0447eTBpTok, 26 Maj 2011 She said that she conceived while being with him, but later changed her statement that she conceived with an unmarried man. Also in this case the father denied the allegations and the case reached the court rooms. The First Children's Embassy in the World Megjashi thinks that he should remain in custody until the case is closed, because there have been previous situations where the suspect exercised pressure on the victim to change their statement. The daughter and her step mother were scared to report the case because the rapist threatened to kill them. The neighbors in shock say that they found out about the case from the media. The residents of Rashche were in shock when three years ago it was released that a 37 year old men from their neighborhood beat his wife for months, locked her in a room, and after that raped their daughter. The father according to them spent the majority of his time in the village of his birth in Gostivar, and rarely came to his current house in Gostivar. The father has rejected the accusations claiming that they are untrue and tales from his wife, in relations to revenge for impaired marital relations. I was arrested and has been in custody for the short period of 48 hours, which expires today at 14 o'clock. Cases of incest are not news to the public in the country. For clarification of this complicated case, swabs have been taken from the girl in order to make a DNA analysis to determine the truth. Last year, a scandal was released in Veles when a 42 year old father sexually abused his three daughters, of whom the oldest was seven years old. The daughter kept silent about the incest due to fear and threats. According to the daughter the rape mainly occurred in her father's car and in the support facility to their family home. A 40 year old man from Tetovo was sentenced to three years in prison for raping his nine year old daughter. And the next day, accompanied by her husband's daughter from his first marriage, she visited the Gostivar police station and reported that the girl has been raped by her father for the part two years. Speaking about the incest the girl who has developmental disabilities, said in front of the investigators that her father forced her to have sexual relations with him. In the past the big problem was the small files that were given to convicted perpetrators. The residents of the house, which was locked yesterday, say that they know very little. The horror, which according to the police occurred on their street, they have nor heard nor felt that this terrible of a secret was hiding in the neighborhood. The 17 year old girl was found by the \"Alpha\" police as frantically running through the village, fleeing from her violent father.",

The incest, shocked the public and caused big reactions of conviction from the organizations for child protection, its discovered now, although according to certain allegation, the abuse of the oldest child began 6 years ago. Megjashi ask for most sever punishment for the father rapist. He, very shortly after he was detained, was brought before investigative judge. Having in mind what was happening in the last period in one family from Veles, its more than obvious that the father sexually abused his three juvenile daughters. Megjashi request the children to be put in foster family and call for the most sever punishment for the father rapist. The police statistic shows fall of number of sexual abuses, which are towards juveniles. According to the police statistic for the same period last year is notice fall of 18 percent. The husband and wife were unemployed, and the suspect has not been reported in police before for this kind of criminal acts.. If the mother knew this and approved the sexual abuse of the three girls we request deprivation of the parent's right of the booth parents and their punishment if she didn't report the case\" is stated from \"Megjashi\".",

        "text":"Just as uncleanness is stigmatised and must be overcome to some people, to others uncleanness is acceptable, even pleasing, and an act of taking a step forward to the moral virtue as opposed to the sterility of the moral horror. The entire language experience of the subject thus becomes schizophrenic, both deficiency and desire experience. It was Lacan who noticed and Kristeva who further elaborated the point of relation between uncleanness-maternal thus giving the abjection, and at the same time cleanness, a psychoanalytic interpretation for the first time. The floor smelled of an old headachy chemical substance, the windows were so clean that one might have thought that there were no windows at all, the furniture was polished - not one fingerprint of the ten professor\u2019s fingers. This means that there was no difference between the former me (as pre- subject) and any other object, occurrence or phenomenon from the outside world (of the object). For other people, however, the perfect order is the hell of this world. I believe that the untidiness was the worst punishment for him. In dictionaries, the abjection (also abject) denoted something despised, mean and poor, i.e. something that had little direct connection with the physical uncleanness and had more associations to a moral, cultural and sociological fall. Given the chance to talk about the experiences from the proto- phase, this entity, with an endless authority, would repeat the words of the Christ\u2019s god that he is equally within all of us. I need to make up for everything I have missed out\u2026 I used to go once a month into his apartment to get him the electricity and water bills and, in return, he would give me chocolate wrapped in white paper and a pack of Fructal juice with a straw. This rift, depending on the subjectification success, will remain a generator of deficiency feeling. Just as cleaning is an act of purification of the guilty conscious to some people, to others, cleanness inaugurates a whole set of feelings of guilt, concern and a need for \u2018getting dirty\u2019. The reason for the inability to achieve final stabilisation lies in the capacity of the semiotic space to enter the symbolic. The Symbolic is just as imaginary, i.e. post-imaginary (being different from the imaginary of the pre-subject) because it is a place of signifiers rather than referents. Thus, the struggle against the unethical and the uncivilised begins with the struggle against disorder and uncleanness. Cleaning as a result of nervousness or neurosis is a common type of female struggle against anxiety. Such habits are not accidental. Seeing around me the despairing ugliness and the multifold severe consequences of the disorder and unwillingness, I promised myself that I will work with a thought and with my hands, for myself and for the others, always and everywhere, yet I will work. In other words, I, the proto- subject, was the whole world. While it exists on the territory of the imaginary\/semiotic, the pre-subject has an illusion of uniqueness. It is in this rift that I will continue functioning indefinitely long, practically forever. To some people, a dirty and untidy fate is part of the hell of this world. For many women, dusting is part of the self-cleaning ritual. This way, every one of us creates a deficiency (of the illusion of the uniqueness) and an infinite desire (for it). According to Lacan, the Symbolic is not identical to what we simply call reality. However, for the psychoanalysis the abjection signified rehabilitation of the cultural stigma of uncleanness and a psychoanalytical answer to the question why civilisation is perceived as a need for cleanness and uncleanness is a blow to civilisation, terrorism against the system, i.e. as Douglas writes, a breach of the order. UTOPIA Territorial issues related to the phenomenon of order and disorder are treated as controversies, at the very least. Due to this fact, the subject will always be dual in nature, having the memory of the imaginary, pre-subject phase, and at the same time he will continue to live the symbolic cultural universe because he knows no other universe. Ego, in Freud\u2019s words, bargains with reality to the benefit of id. According to Andric, as we can see, the ethical dimensions of brutality towards oneself and others, as well as the cultural dimensions of stagnation and poverty are directly related to the feeling of disorder and uncleanness. All cultural segments that offer ready-made models for proper life point to this and they are most evident in the advertisements, which constantly compete in saturating the market with products that successfully help the struggle against uncleanness. Even this ritual spoke of his tidiness, as well as my greed - for I would cry in tears if someone else got him the bills before me. Occasionally, various personal states and various phenomena, within and outside of me, remind me of the semiotic state of all allowed and achieved enjoyment, which Kristeva called abjections. Kristeva robs them of the objective quality - they are neither tools, objects, machines nor anything that has the qualities of an object, therefore, they cannot be part of the symbolic because the symbolic consists of objectified phenomena, of signifiers with correlatives. Unfortunately, this feeling, though not rare, is not supported by cultural institutions, including the church. As such, this group of people have no choice but to quietly endure their contradictory drives for uncleanness because the culture refuses to channel them. I have faith in my ability more and more. So I will - and this is only the first step - start doing mathematics. When the subject chooses pleasure that weighs the balance of gain and loss, practically, when the subject bargains for pleasure, this is a kind of pleasure. The obsession for cleanness goes hand in hand with the desire for order - namely, for many people, cleaning is the synonym for order, therefore, cleaning to them means tiding up, arranging things in the right place, despite the indefinite question: what is the right place for an object? We might just as well say, with a certain degree of na\u00efve simplification, that the proto- subject is a kind of God, or even better a proto-God. The way Kristeva inaugurated the abjection, was practically to unite the two perspectives from a psychoanalytical point of view - the repulsiveness and the attractiveness of the phenomenon of uncleanness. This way I will live permanently in a fertile movement and useful changes; I promised myself that I will defend myself and the place where I live from disorder and uncleanness, from stagnation and poverty.\u201d Nevertheless, even if you cannot imagine your daily routine without dusting, washing up the dishes, personal hygiene and spatial hygiene, it is highly unlikely that the reasons for such need seem more transparent to you than the reasons for their own tolerance of uncleanness (or dirt) are unintelligible to other people. One thing is clear: if you practice the cleanness rituals without a high degree of guilty conscience or if you practice them in order to overcome a guilty conscience, then you belong to the group of socialised people because the culture and its institutions act in a way that they impose a guilty conscience about uncleanness. Let us remind ourselves of the Bosnian writer Ivo Andric, a Nobel Prize winner for Literature, who wrote the following in his famous book of meditative prose \"Signs by the Roadside\": \u201cThe people in a small town are chatty, brutal and stupid, while life is smelly and futile, full of misery and humour, Gogolian humour \u2026 As a child, I was afraid of the sorrow of that apartment. In the Oxford Dictionary of English Language from 1990, the abjection (abject) is still defined in three ways: 1. People, apart from various other issues, are generally different regarding their experience of uncleanness as an ethical equivalent of the fall and corruption. It is interesting to point out that Ana Dimiskovska-Trajanovska, a Macedonian philosopher and poetess, in the poem Betrayal from her book of poems Flower Blossom, intuitively complies with Kristeva\u2019s theory when she defines the principle of entering the world as a principle of betraying one\u2019s mother: \u201cFirst\/ you betray the non-being \/ for you mother\u2019s sake \/ Then \/ you betray your mother \/ for the world\u2019s sake.\u201d This illusion is megalomaniac in its nature, for the proto-newborn is, just as everyone in the world is, part of a single unique entity. There is another group of people who have a guilty conscience caused by cleanness. Miljenko Jergovic, the famous author of Sarajevo Marlboro - a portrait of the war in Bosnia (1992-1996), in the women\u2019s magazine Cosmopolitan (May, 2003), in other words, a magazine intended for cultural inauguration of cleanness and tidiness, published an article in which he described order and cleanness as synonyms for stagnation and ethical hell. For the proto-subject, which is referred to as the libidinal child by Kristeva, the reality is the very principle of enjoyment - he will never be able to say the things that a child in a semiotic phase might say: that the only reality is my own enjoyment because there is neither a system of norms and values nor an order which is endangered by my enjoyment. I and I only exist and my enjoyment as part of me, and this will be the case as long as, through the speech and the choice of the desired object in the phase of the Oedipal triangle, I enter the world of language, which is paternal. This crazy proto-subject who enjoys the grand megalomania, to its own misfortune and (maybe) fortunately for the others, will have to replace this megalomania later in its life with a more modest position of a renegade from the Middle Ages, who will never smile again nor be able to say that he feels like God, except in the rare moments of infinite happiness (let us remind ourselves about the definition that life is fifteen minutes of infinite happiness). I, subjectified, as part of the order which marks, uses, gives and produces meaning, remember the illusion of uniqueness. Freud incidentally explains the need for beauty.",

He asked who he was and what he had done. 10 While we were staying there, a prophet named Agav came down from Y\u2019hudah 11 to visit us. 20 On hearing it, they praised God; but they also said to him, \u201cYou see, brother, how many tens of thousands of believers there are among the Judeans, and they are all zealots for the Torah. 21 Now what they have been told about you is that you are teaching all the Jews living among the Goyim to apostatize from Moshe, telling them not to have a b\u2019rit-milah for their sons and not to follow the traditions. 39 Sha\u2019ul said, \u201cI am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of an important city; and I ask your permission to let me speak to the people.\u201d 32 Immediately he took officers and soldiers and charged down upon them. 17 In Yerushalayim, the brothers received us warmly. And now he has even brought some Goyim into the Temple and defiled this holy place!\u201d 29 (They had previously seen Trophimus from Ephesus in the city with him and assumed that Sha\u2019ul had brought him into the Temple.) 33 Then the commander came up, arrested him and ordered him to be tied up with two chains. We have four men who are under a vow. 24 Take them with you, be purified with them, and pay the expenses connected with having their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that there is nothing to these rumors which they have heard about you; but that, on the contrary, you yourself stay in line and keep the Torah. Guided by the Spirit, they told Sha\u2019ul not to go up to Yerushalayim; 5 but when the week was over, we left to continue our journey. When they finally became still, he addressed them in Hebrew: 35 When Sha\u2019ul got to the steps, he actually had to be carried by the soldiers, because the mob was so wild \u2014 36 the crowd kept following and screaming, \u201cKill him!\u201d 8 The following day, we left and came to Caesarea, where we went to the home of Philip the proclaimer of the Good News, one of the Seven, and stayed with him. They brought us to the home of the man with whom we were to stay, Mnason from Cyprus, who had been a talmid since the early days. 31 But while they were attempting to kill him, word reached the commander of the Roman battalion that all Yerushalayim was in turmoil. 27 The seven days were almost up when some unbelieving Jews from the province of Asia saw him in the Temple, stirred up all the crowd and grabbed him. 9 He had four unmarried daughters with the gift of prophecy. 28 \u201cMen of Isra\u2019el, help!\u201d they shouted. The next day we went to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 2 On finding a ship that was crossing over to Phoenicia, we embarked and set sail. 3 After sighting Cyprus, we passed it on the left, sailed to Syria and landed at Tzor, because that was where the ship was unloading its cargo. 25 \u201cHowever, in regard to the Goyim who have come to trust in Yeshua, we all joined in writing them a letter with our decision that they should abstain from what had been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled and from fornication.\u201d There we greeted the brothers and stayed with them overnight. \u201cThis is the man who goes everywhere teaching everyone things against the people, against the Torah and against this place! 18 The next day Sha\u2019ul and the rest of us went in to Ya\u2018akov, and all the elders were present. 15 So at the end of our stay, we packed and went up to Yerushalayim; 16 and with us went some of the talmidim from Caesarea. 19 After greeting them, Sha\u2019ul described in detail each of the things God had done among the Gentiles through his efforts. As soon as they saw the commander, they quit beating Sha\u2019ul. 12 When we heard this, both we and the people there begged him not to go up to Yerushalayim; 13 but Sha\u2019ul answered, \u201cWhat are you doing, crying and trying to weaken my resolve? 7 When the voyage from Tzor was over, we arrived at Ptolemais. 34 Everyone in the crowd shouted something different; so, since he couldn\u2019t find out what had happened because of the uproar, he ordered him brought to the barracks.",

        "text":"The last official data provided by the PERI-RNM indicate that the utilization of the railroad tracks in North Macedonia in 2019 was only 15.62% of their full capacity. Mostly because of that, the international passenger trains to Greece and Serbia were and are unattractive for the passengers, which has led to their cancellations throughout the years. If this is translated into metric tons, out of 1,838,888 tons of goods transported by trains on the Macedonian railroad, the \"transiting\" participated with 833,951 tons. Concerning all the goods that are transported with cargo trains in Macedonia, almost solely on the railroad track of the Corridor 10, the share of the transiting trains in the total railroad transportation in 2019 was 45.4 %.

They promise that this year they will finish the reconstruction of the railroad track between Nogaevci and Negotino, 31 km long, with the money provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, i.e. \u20ac3 million. These studies have led to the conclusion that the passenger transportation in the future will not be dominant for the railroad and that high-speed trains for intercity transportation of passengers during the analyzed period are not a profitable investment, said professor Zoran Krakutovski. The reconstruction of the Nogaevci \u2013 Negotino section of the railroad track on the Corridor 10 that has been delayed for 7 years has again shifted the attention to the question of how competent we are as a state when it comes to maintaining the strategic infrastructure facilities. Such analysis of the current condition of the track was performed in 2008\/2009, but since then so much time has passed and I cannot give an evaluation of the track's condition along Corridor 10 now on the basis of that study.\t\u0412\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0432\u043e 2008\/2009 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0434 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0448 \u0434\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043c \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440-10 \u043e\u0434 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d \u0430\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442. The research study states that the adjustment of the public procurements for major infrastructural projects to the economic criteria for the EU accession is important, in order to ensure that this market is functional, is competitive and free, and this country is adhering to the public debt norms, as was planned with the Maastricht criteria. Professor Zoran Krakutovski, PhD, of the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Skopje explained for Meta.mk that analyses were conducted about the idea to build a completely new railroad track between Drachevo and Veles, with the idea to vacate the current railroad corridor along Vardar River and enable construction of hydro power plants. By this deadline, only 15% of the railroad between Belgrade and Stara Pazova were built and 44% of the railroad between Stara Pazova and Novi Sad, and the building of the railroad track between Novi Sad and Subotica hasn't started at all. The country's public debt towards the end of 2020 has reached almost 61% of the GDP, which means that Macedonia is one step of becoming a highly indebted country. The Public Enterprise for Railway Infrastructure of the Republic of North Macedonia (PERI-RNM) reveals that several variants were outlined and according to them, the most favorable one is for a new railroad track as part of the Corridor 10, starting from the Karposh Station at Kumanovo through Ovche Pole and the eastern part of the country to the village of Miravci near Gevgelija, where it would join the existing railroad track. The Institute for Democracy \"Societas Civilis\" last year published the study \"Pushed into a dead-end street: The deluded belief in the Chinese corrosive capital for building motorways in North Macedonia.\" China's interest for fast railroad in Macedonia If such a railroad is built in our country, it certainly will be part of a regional or continental connection between bigger cities and demographic centers, where there is a potential for a larger number of passengers that would be traveling long distances,\" said Krakutovski. With the new track, greater speeds could be achieved and the distance would be shortened by 30 km. Accordingly, Professor Krakutovski's expert opinion is that so far the most economically feasible option is the upgrade of the existing railroad track along the Corridor 10. A fast railroad track is a track for speeds higher than 160 km\/h intended for faster passenger transportation and these tracks are built as double track.\t\u041f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u0440\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0434 160\u043a\u043c\/\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0434\u0432\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438 (\u043f\u043e \u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a \u0432\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u045c\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0430). Even though PERI-RNM wouldn't directly mention the potential investor, still China is the only country that at the moment is interested in building fast railroad from Budapest through Serbia and North Macedonia to Thessaloniki along Corridor 10. As a result, any new loans from China for construction of a fast railroad track could put the country into financial slavery \u2013 without any financial justification for such a project. With the new railroad track, the time for the transit trains from Serbia toward Greece and vice versa would be shortened, trains that do not need to enter either Skopje, Veles, or Negotino.\t\u0421\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u0431\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043e\u0434 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0440\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0432\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u043e \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0458\u0435, \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441, \u041d\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, North Macedonia faces major hurdles on the way of obeying the Maastricht criteria, at least in the part of the public debt and the norms it involves. Instead of building new railroad track with \"slavery\" loan from China, North Macedonia must reconstruct the current railroads At the same time, the transit trains which were passing through North Macedonia weren't chartered by Chinese logistics companies only, but also by other European companies. Namely, 991,245 tons or 53.9% out of the total cargo transported by trains in 2019 represented import of goods in North Macedonia and export of goods. And finally, what is considered a top strategic priority for North Macedonia is the railroad connections with all of its neighbors, which could be achieved only if the Corridor 8 toward Bulgaria and Albania is put into place. Regarding the track to toward Bulgaria, loans have been taken and EU assets have been granted for all three phases of its construction, while during the past autumn, the government has decided to start the search for assets for building a railway line toward Albania. The study stresses that what is necessary is to check the origin and the ownership of the capital before giving it a privileged position in the country's domestic economy, in order to prevent the entrance of corrosive capital that could undermine the trust in the institutions, to weaken the rule of law, to promote non-transparency and to impose monopoly over enormous segments in the economy. Yet, five years later, the data provided by the State Statistical Office of North Macedonia indicate that the country is far from being an important transit route for the Chinese merchandise transported to the West. By delaying the deadline for finishing the project and with the irregular railroad reconstructions, the travel time for passengers and goods transportation amplifies. What is the reason to not build at all? Bigger investments in the reconstruction of the railroad tracks in North Macedonia, meeting the deadlines for the reconstruction projects and raising the maximum travel speed to 120 km\/h on the railroad track between Tabanovce and Gevgelija. By the 31st of December 2019, US$521.2 million were spent on the construction of the fast rairoad track between Belgrade and the Serbian\/Hungarian border. Still, even the pre-feasibility studies for the Drachevo \u2013 Veles and Kumanovo \u2013 Deljadrovci had shown that there is no economic grounds for abandoning the existing corridor and constructing a track for faster speed, because that since a greater demand for passenger transportation is needed. All in all, the upgrade of the railroad track between Kumanovo and Deljadrovci, 17 km long, will cost \u20ac50 million, said PERI-RNM. What is important is that the statistical data shows that the most certain partner of the cargo railroad traffic until today has been the Macedonian economy. He also said that an compprehensive analysis of the track's condition on basis of existing data and a visual inspection ought to be performed. Using Chinese loans, Serbia and Hungary are building the railroad track between Belgrade and Budapest. One of the projects is for preparing the technical documentation for the repairs of the bridges and facilities located along the Corridor 10. The second project is on the preparation of the technical documentation for the enlargement of capacities of border stations such as Blace, Tabanovce, Bogorodica, and Kremenica. If these goals are not reached by the government of North Macedonia, the railroad of the Corridor 10 cannot be competitive to the motorway on this corridor nor to the railroad track of the Corridor 4 that is passing through Bulgaria and Romania, when it comes to the transport of goods and passengers from Greece to the countries of former Yugoslavia and Central Europe. The data provided by the State Statistical Office for the period before 2019, indicate that there were years when the transiting trains were transporting larger quantities of goods, as is the example of 2011, when 875,908 tons of goods were transported. During the analysis back in 2009 it was concluded that out of 215 km total length, an upgrade must be done for 102 km until the year 2015,\" explains professor Krakutovski. The option for construction of a fast railroad track with the possibility of reaching 160km\/h was rejected, as is the case with idea for a fast railroad track between Drachevo and Veles. There are two options for the upgrade, and the decision to be made is whether in the future the passenger and cargo trains would be driving with a maximum speed of 100 km\/h or 120 km\/h. Because of this, the companies are opting for truck transportation which leads to lowering the usage of railroad' capacities and to financial losses for the state. The case of the Chinese loan in Serbia closely resembles the construction of the Kichevo-Ohrid motorway on the Corridor 8 in North Macedonia, at least in the way the assets were spent and the deadlines were not met. Concerning Serbia, there are warnings that the country is on the edge of credit slavery to China, and the Council against Corruption in Serbia criticized that all deadlines were breached, but also the budget for this high speed track. In the aftermath of the study in 2009, a reconstruction of the railroad tracks Miravci \u2013 Smokvica, Tabanovce \u2013 Kumanovo, Zgropolci- Gradsko and Smokvica-Gevgelija was done, but since then, several years have passed.",

Last week, the ELN also released hostages, including two workers of an oil company operating in the Arauca province near the Venezuelan border. The ELN launched a deadly attack on a police academy last year, killing 22 cadets and injuring 66 others. After upending any chance for peace talks with a deadly attack last year, the group has signaled its willingness to temporarily end hostilities. As long as the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and armed violence persist, we will continue to work to protect lives and the dignity of those affected by this reality. ICRC teams that visited the areas verified the six people were in adequate health conditions for their transfer, said the humanitarian organization. The National Liberation Army (ELN), one of Colombia's biggest active guerrilla groups, released six hostages on Sunday, according to a statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Last month, the Colombian military killed a key ELN commander in a targeted strike. The Colombian government has said it would not engage in peace talks until the ELN ends kidnappings, frees hostages, and ceases attacks on infrastructure.",

With this donation, the Bank during the past 10 months has donated more than 220,000 euros in dealing with the coronavirus through equipment and materials for support of the health workers: We are now entering the immunization period which we believe will be the end of this global pandemic and people will finally be able to operate and function freely again. Last year, the Bank said that it would not stop there, and also thanks to Stopanska Banka for the special navigation systems and GPS locators for 21 ambulance vehicles, thus, allowing us to know exactly where they are, facilitating emergency medical care, which will completely improve the operation of this service, and faster access to health services for the citizens.

The following questions are an exercise: How they process it is another matter, but when they are put in such a function, then it is about abuse\", says Ilija Acevski, Professor of Urban Sociology. Children play elections! Skopje \u2013 Elections are introduced to children through games like \"Ludo\" and textbooks which at the age of nine teach them how to vote and how councilors are elected in municipalities Elections and their importance are introduced to children at school through textbooks that claim to be consistent with the age of the children. However, the authors of the textbooks are not to blame, but those in charge of preparing the curriculum.\t\u0421\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043a, \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u0442\u0443\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0438 \u0433\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438. When a ten-year-old child listens to it, he does not understand who these people are. Every citizen who has reached the age of 18 has the right to vote, it is written under the picture in the textbook \"Society\" for fourth grade, represented with a ballot box and a hand putting a ballot paper in it. However, university professors and experts do not agree with that. On the contrary, they warn that care should be taken in conveying the contents to children, especially to the younger age, to which only elementary knowledge of democracy needs to be introduced, not to force other contents. They say that when for example the term democracy is to be explained to a child at the age of ten, it is the basic, fundamental level without any complicated terms and definitions. The back writes: for aged 7-97. Acevski emphasizes that through textbooks children are prematurely taught the basics of democracy because according to him, the most appropriate age for teaching political terms is after the age of 12. And not only that, but what direct democracy is and what representative democracy is. However, university professors and experts do not agree with that. Or, to take them to campaign rallies, which according to them is nothing other than their abuse. Every citizen who has reached the age of 18 has the right to vote, it is written under the picture in the textbook \"Society\" for fourth grade, represented with a ballot box and a hand putting a ballot paper in it. Fourth grade children are nine or ten years old, and learn about elections, their relevance, how the local community functions and what representative democracy is. On page 69 in the same textbook pupils learn about municipal authorities, where, among other things, it says that elections for the municipal council are held every four years, as well as for the mayor, who is said to be \"elected in general, direct and free elections by secret ballot\".

Learning objectives are allocated and systematized according to the emotional, social, cognitive, psychomotor and moral development of pupils. On the front there are figures with hands raised up which associates victory, and in the background there is the state flag. In the textbook children are also taught about democracy. They say that when for example the term democracy is to be explained to a child at the age of ten, it is the basic, fundamental level without any complicated terms and definitions. \u2013 \"When were the last municipal elections held in your municipality?\" They can practically realize what democracy is through an exercise in which they all take part together.\t\u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0436\u0431\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0430\u0442, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0430.

Examples enumerate presence of children in rallies, then in electoral headquarters, in advertisements, or in cases where they stick posters or hand out leaflets with political content and other advertising material.

Elections and their importance are introduced to children at school through textbooks that claim to be consistent with the age of the children. If children could answer this question in details, it could be assumed that they are often exposed to discussions with political-party content within their family or in their environment\", says Dragi Zmijanac, director and founder of \"Medjashi\". \u2013 \"When were the last municipal elections held in your municipality?\" Biljana Kamcevska, Methodology Professor at the Pedagogical Faculty \"St. Kliment Ohridski\", says that the content offered in textbooks pertaining political notions does not correspond to children's age. Therefore when writing textbooks they should especially pay attention to the style of expression (harmonized with readers' age), as well as the scope and contents\", they point out from the Bureau. Zmijanac adds that children still need to be informed about what is happening in the municipality and be previously consulted if decisions are taken regarding them. Which means it is for kids, too! Concerning the fact whether children at the age of nine or ten need to learn about elections, as well as about their possible abuses in terms of politics, we discussed with those responsible at the First Children's Embassy in the World \"Medjashi\". Textbooks in primary education during the previous Minister Nikola Todorov were a subject of extensive review because of the identified errors, illogical and difficult style of expression in the textbooks, later confirmed by Todorov himself. For example, the book says that \"through a referendum (voting) citizens decide on matters regarding their settlement\". The investigation is supported by CIN SCOOP MACEDONIA within the project Raising awareness about corruption though investigative report A title written in capital letters on a box that resembles that of the well-known board game \"Ludo\", but of some other contents. \u2013 \"Can a discontented citizen file a complaint against the municipality? Although he adds: \"We doubt that a child could answer the question: How many councilors are there in your municipality?, he says. On the contrary, they warn that care should be taken in conveying the contents to children, especially to the younger age, to which only elementary knowledge of democracy needs to be introduced, not to force other contents. It raises the question: Is it clear to children what exactly elections are? \u2013 \"How many members are there in your municipal council?\"",

But there are some tips for home care during diarrhoea. Probiotic bacteria can also be used to maintain an adequate concentration of microflora in the gut. Children can dehydrate very quickly when suffering from diarrhoea, so it is crucial to know the signs of dehydration, e.g., infrequent urination and sluggishness. Probiotic bacteria can also be used to maintain an adequate concentration of microflora in the gut. All of these typically result in an imbalance in the gut flora. Firstly, they should consume more fluids (but avoid fruit juice and fizzy drinks) to replace the water the body is losing. In most cases, acute diarrhoea, especially the virus-related version, goes away by itself. When a child is suffering from a bout of diarrhoea, probiotic supplements are recommended to reinforce the gut flora. BioGaia drops or tablets, for example, contain Lactobacillus reuteri Protectis which has been proven to maintain the natural bacterial balance in the gut and enhance overall well-being. Defined as more than three loose or liquid stools a day, diarrhoea is one of the most common health problems affecting children worldwide. All of these typically result in an imbalance in the gut flora. The most common causes of diarrhoea in children are pathogenic microbes, maldigestion, and antibiotic therapy. In most cases, acute diarrhoea, especially the virus-related version, goes away by itself. In this condition it is recommended to supplement the gut flora, for example with BioGaia drops or tablets containing Lactobacillus reuteri Protectis which help colonize the gut microflora. Probiotic bacteria can also be used to maintain an adequate concentration of microflora in the gut. Surrounded by other children at nursery or school, children are bound to experience a bout of diarrhoea every now and again. Finally, WHO and UNICEF recommend supplementing zinc to aid rehydration.

        "text":"Indeed, it is a lot easier for you to cheat when you know you can always return to the fold. Nonetheless, a problem arises when you do not feel sufficiently caressed and protected by the one to whom you have entrusted her heart. Capricorn If you are a woman, brimming with feelings that you are unable to express, you will not imagine, not even in dreams, of cheating on your partner even in spite of numerous opportunities. Even if marriage is an institution supposedly invented by a Libran, Librans are masters in the art of flirtation because of their desperate need for compliments. For this reason, no extramarital relationship can make you happy. In such cases, you don\u2019t even realize you are leaving yourself open to infidelity. But when things do not happen that way, then you will seek confirmation elsewhere. If you are a woman, beautiful, sensuous, attached to house and family, ready to leave your ambitions behind in the name of the family\u2019s happiness, you should be a model of fidelity. Gemini Many say that the word \u201cInfidelity\u201d with a capital \u201ci\u201d should hang close to the Gemini sign. Thus in your parallel liaisons there is more flirtatiousness and shuffling of forces than a true love flame. This is why it is dangerous for you husband to lose interest in you, to become the type who hits the armchair, newspaper in hand, not responding to your new hairdo or perfume. However, at the last minute, in order to avoid rocking the boat, you change tactics and make a fast retreat. But when you sink, you sink all the way to the bottom. But as you get older and accumulate riches and power, you turn into a real seducer proud of each and every one of your conquests. If you are a woman, when you marry you truly wish to be faithful. Only a real convergence of circumstances will allow this desire to translate itself into reality. If you are a man, you are seemingly cold and indifferent. However, if you have already gotten over your fear that your partner might curtail your freedom and if you are already married, then you will remain faithful until the end of your days. At such moments you will feel like allowing yourself to indulge in an affair with the man who promises you will take first place in his life. You consider secret love meetings that could complicate your life as something unworthy of you. If you are a man, you often imagine how things might be if you were to check things out someplace else, but you will never allow an adventure to disturb your life. If you are a man, you are unfaithful by definition. If you are a woman, compliments are your weakness. If you are a woman, you will certainly give the best of yourself in order to make your marriage a happy one. Indeed, you simply love to melt women\u2019s hearts, imagining that in this way you prove your power over others. But from the moment when you feel that your husband does not treat you the way he should, you will seek praise elsewhere. But since you need to be caressed, pampered and often do not control yourself very well, you fail to resist temptation. If you are a man, you are undoubtedly proud when it is said of you that you that you are the biggest seducer in your midst. This is not to say that you will always go all the way. That helps you to recover your partner\u2019s trust. Cancer On the other hand, the need to be unfaithful in order to prove your power to other women is a definitely infantile reason. You have the capacity of imagining such lies that you wind up believing them yourself after just a few phrases. And further: you attempt to keep under control even those partners with whom you no longer have anything in common. Pisces Fortunately, nature has given you a way with words. If you are included in the first one, you are certainly equipped with great self-control. The latter do not have to be either beautiful or sharp and whether they love you or not is of no importance since in any case you will move in to catch your prize. In reality, you only want to taste a bit of the forbidden fruit and, should it please you, then you will gnaw into it right down to the very end. How, when and with whom are irrelevant. You may cheat for the sake of revenge or remain faithful until the end of your days as long as you find an intelligent and secretive partner who will know how to keep you interested. If your partner does not grant you total freedom in your relationship, you will use the first opportunity to cheat that happens your way. If you are a woman, you surely know that you trigger the erotic imagination of persons of the opposite sex. But when you are being unfaithful, you go about it without any style, satisfied with consuming your latest love prize at one time. If you are a woman, your calm nature and friendly disposition ensure you a good number of admirers. Signs and Fidelity You are the happiest of men when you do not have to struggle too much and when the one you have set your eyes on comes to cuddle into your arms all by herself. If you are a woman, you certainly know already that you are valued by men for the tolerance you show and for your capacity to sacrifice yourself for your spouse and your relationship. However, should you plunge but once into the waves of infidelity, you soon become an expert in the art of justifying all sorts of dubious situations. If you are a man, you certainly take many liberties and have more chances for adventure. It is not surprising to find you with one woman in the morning, another one later on in the day and a third one in the evening. If you are a man, you behave like a collector, independently of what may be involved, whether houses, money, art objects, blonds or brunettes. This is why you may well join in marriage without love entering into the picture. Most likely, he will be a person able to improve your material situation or help you get ahead in your career. If you are a man, you do not choose your victims. And if things turn the wrong way, you will first leave he family nest and then go looking for another partner. However, if you are more courageous than the rest, you will decide to throw the dice and choose to go for either everything or nothing. And only fear of finding your comfort compromised and your fortune diminished will force you to remain faithful. You tend to cheat on your companion smoothly and without spending too many words. If you are a woman, endowed with a strong temperament and self-confidence, you will do your best to conquer the kind of guy that drives all the other women insane, only for the fun of it and to prove to yourself how irresistible you are, even if you are married. Nevertheless, if you are satisfied with your sex life, you are the incarnation of fidelity itself. Only quality liaisons interest you. And if you should happen to cheat, you then will remain faithful to your partner. Nonetheless, if you are a woman, you are not unfaithful from birth; instead, your active intelligence and wide knowledge prompt you to become so. If you are a man, you hardly ever allow yourself to cheat. Daughters to Venus and sons to Mars, women and men behave in different ways when it comes to fidelity. However, you always go for what is least risky, intent on keeping up the appearances of being a stable woman, a good wife, a good housekeeper, and a good mother. This is why, if you should make up your mind to be unfaithful, you will do so with the goal of punishing your partner for his deficiencies or, otherwise, for interests of a material nature. It is interesting to notice that you have the capacity to love several men simultaneously without your marriage thereby losing in weight or quality. Seemingly, everyone is fulfilled. You think for a long time before marrying, afraid of making a mistake. Nonetheless, only rarely will you go by unnoticed and in some cases the whole neighborhood will be aware of your infidelities.",

I am not worried about my livelihood. With unrestrained enthusiasm, then as an outreach worker, armed with a backpack filled with \"injection equipment\" and educational booklets, I used to drop by and visit the \"girls and guys\" (I never liked calling them clients), from door to door, talking to them, explaining the program benefits and services. They welcomed us, understanding our inexperience. We were just beginning after all! Ten thousands of people are insignificant. I can earn the same salary in any of the textile companies or in construction, even receive social and health insurance as a bonus this time, something I sacrificed for the last 12 years, apart from my time of course. On the one hand, it was us, the \"novices\" fresh young activists with new vision about discrimination, stigma and injustice drug users suffered on a daily basis, and on the other, the already experienced colleagues from HOPS \u2013 Health Options Project Skopje. Twice a month, we would patrol around schools to collect needles and syringes left by users, a regular sight at the time but a rarity nowadays. We all learned from HOPS. The development of these programs would have been impossible without their unwavering support. The Program later developed into the civil society organization HOPS \u2013 Healthy Options Project Skopje, with its founding members later becoming our mentors. What can we say? In October, 2005, we started building the capacities of our organizations. From 2004 to 2007, with the Global Fund's support, five other new programs were opened within the organizations Pulse from Kumanovo, the Youth Club in Shtip, Zona in Kavadarci, Option in Ohrid and Help in Gostivar. Obviously, it made a difference. They welcomed the program as their own. We were deceived. The situation with Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria will reprise. There, after all harm reduction programs were closed, the rate of new HIV infections jumped to the ceiling. THAT is our job, to reduce the harm of every individual, save their health and that of the surrounding. Denis Ampev The author is the Harm Reduction Program Coordinator and human rights and workers' rights activist. Every day we meet new young people surprised to see that a person who has erred in this country can find understanding without being judged, or receive a medical service without having to repeat their medical history to every doctor they meet. How many lives have we saved? It's the same story everywhere, we have come to the same conclusion with the colleagues from other organizations, \"We have the support, but not the finances.\" I was overjoyed with happiness! Let's tell politicians we are fed up! I remember well, we started from scratch. I am personally not worried about myself. The fact that the experience of 100 employees and even more volunteers will go to waste and they will be forced to start anew is also insignificant. How many people have we helped? However, when on July 1, 2017, thousands of users of harm reduction programs implemented by HELP from Gostivar, Pulse from Kumanovo, Via Vita from Bitola, Option from Ohrid, Zona from Kavadarci, Izbor from Strumica, the Red Cross from Veles, Prilep and Kicevo, HOPS from Skopje and the Centre for Development and Promotion of Public Life Tetovo will come to find closed doors, after a decade of working and changing views, awareness, and opinions, they will realize that we abandoned them, and no excuse will suffice. We distributed thousands syringes and twice that many needles, hundred thousand condoms and many more educational leaflets and brochures, constantly working with them, reassuring them of their right to a second chance. All the hard effort to get to the point we have reached today would go to waste. In Shtip, I personally brought in a desk, chairs, pencil cups, staplers and other office supplies from my home for the new Harm Reduction Program in Shtip. We did our best in Shtip. We have to protect Macedonia from a disease developed countries already responded to. We never boasted or advertised, we simply did what we thought was right. Only several months later, whenever I returned to the offices from the field, \"the gang\" would chill with a cup of coffee, discussing different topics in the common room. At the moment, they are anxious about the prospective closure more than us. In the distant 1996, a group of people opened the first Harm Reduction Program in Macedonia called M.A.S.K.A. At the time of writing this article, there were 15 harm reduction centres in 13 towns in Macedonia, with additional services provided in some. The sooner the authorities realize that, the greater the odds to save ourselves from a Titanesque tragedy. Let us not be the iceberg that sank the whole ship! Our struggle will not suffice, in this I am certain. We participated in different platforms, conferences and festivals throughout the country, I apologize if I forget to mention some. Many of those events no longer exist but they boosted cooperation among organizations, introduced the citizens with the programs, gave visibility and helped us create quality services for our \"girls and guys\". We kept in touch with other organizations dealing with the same process, exchanging experiences and ideas. I know that thousands of users will come knocking on the institutions' doors, asking for what they are entitled to! But it's more than the material aspect. We were approaching Macedonia Square with heavy hearts, silently wondering whether it was possible to fall down in obscurity and be forgotten after 12 years in the forefront of the epidemic struggle. Now that they are aware of their rights and health, they will seek not only services but rather look for the culprit. In fact, the march was the last commemoration of the World AIDS Day before the Global Fund ended the financial support of our organizations and thousands of users within the harm reduction programs lost access to the HIV prevention services. How many lives changed to the better? Until 2011, Izbor from Strumica opened similar programs in Gevgelija, and the Centre for Development and Promotion of Public Life Tetovo in Tetovo, also with the support of the Global Fund. We were never offered the opportunity Croatia had, where 90% of the services are financed by the state. We designed programs with several services under one roof, where people who use drugs can find support without being judged or moralized, in anonymity and confidentiality. The greatest recognition, however, arrived from the \"girls and guys\" who still frequent our offices and use the services we offer. We managed to leave a permanent mark by closing the door shut to discrimination and stigmatization against similar organizations. Around the same time, the Macedonian Red Cross opened harm reduction programs in Veles, Prilep and Kicevo. From 2000 to 2002, couple of other harm reduction programs were developed in Izbor in Strumica and Via Vita in Bitola. They know they can receive a service and advice from a social worker without feeling like being questioned by the Gestapo (I use the word Gestapo because institutions in Macedonia have become interrogation centres with inexperienced doctors and social workers seeking new employment every two weeks). Was it really possible that the country would simply dismiss its own citizens after 12 years? Organizations in other towns went through the same ordeal, which only encouraged us in convincing the population how pointless and misdirected the stigma and fear were. We worked so hard to build this and now it might disappear forever. Together we set up the harm reduction teams for drug use and HIV prevention. It has been several months since the last protest march held by the HIV Platform on December 1, 2016 in Skopje, the last call for action and leadership to stop the closure of all HIV prevention programs in the country, including organizations implementing harm reduction programs. It wasn't us? More than a decade ago we participated in the first harm reduction training in order to stand at the forefront of human rights activism for people who use drugs in Macedonia. We worked hard in order to succeed. The recognition from the donor motivated us to persevere. Wandering through the institutional labyrinths from door to door, marginalized and discriminated against, with no services available to them, their future is doomed. We truly did! For now, however, politicians decided that the 12 years of experience bear no significance. In Shtip, we initiated voluntary collection of discarded infectious waste that had accumulated for years around schools and nurseries. By ourselves, with our finances and the guys' dedication we collected hundreds of kilos of potential risk to the local community. Together with the \"girls and guys\" throughout Macedonia we passed that exam. They will, because the time when drug users were silent is long gone. There was fear on the concerned faces of colleagues from other towns that the HIV epidemic we have successfully fought for 12 years will finally arrive at our doorstep. We have to move forward! We must show what we have achieved so far. It's about the young lives, the young citizens who, having made the wrong decision, will one day return to society as re-socialized, re-integrated and healthy. They'll be back on the streets, I know, just like 12 years ago, with no one to appeal to. They adopted their own house rules and respected the joint space. At the time 12 years younger, my colleagues and I managed to create a unique program, never seen before in Shtip. You have our support.\", now \u2013 the struggle for money continues. It wasn't easy for them (at the beginning, anyone seen in the vicinity of our organization was labelled a \"junky\" by the passersby), however, bashfully and with reluctance, the \"girls and guys\" flocked to our offices to seek the services we offered.",

Previously, in the course of December 2014 and January 2015 in total five working meetings were organized, which resulted in development of base-line questionnaires for collection of data from the courts and public prosecutor offices, as well as separate questionnaires for monitoring of court hearings. Based on the previous experience on the organization on this field, as well as the importance of USAID's Women's Legal Protection Project, representative of ESE moderated the thematic session for monitoring of court cases related to gender-based violence and discrimination. The court monitoring will be conducted by monitors from the Coalition All for Fair Trial. Millions of citizens around the world, particularly youth, are demanding more open and accountable governance. As part of the USAID Legal Protection Project, on 27th of January Association ESE is organizing the last sixth working meeting for development of questionnaires for collection of data from court cases related to violence and discrimination against women. The questionnaires for court monitoring will be used for monitoring on-going court cases related to violence and discrimination against women. We should promote open societies, a free media and freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, legal empowerment and the rule of law. Data collection regarding the work of judges in these cases shall be used for the preparation of an analysis with recommendations to improve the protection provided by the judiciary and other relevant institutions in this area. The main goal of the three-year project is to raise the level of legal protection of women who are victims of discrimination and violence in the country. The objective of the event is to promote the concept of judicial monitoring and exchange experiences between different missions and organizations that are applying this concept in their work. The reasons are overwhelming. We, the under-signed, believe transparent, accountable and inclusive institutions are vital if we are to end poverty and protect the planet. We are convinced that a specific goal addressing this urgent call is an essential component of the Post-2015 Development Framework. We should also join forces to implement anti-corruption measures that enable effective and inclusive economic, social and political institutions at all levels of society. The process of preparation of the respective questionnaires included representatives from vulnerable groups, civil, criminal and misdemeanour judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers, representatives of relevant international organizations, as well as representatives of partner organizations in the project, LA STRADA and Coalition of sexual and health rights of marginalized communities. In the period 26 - 28 November 2014 in Tbilisi, Georgia, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has organized the Annual Trial Monitoring Meeting. Stojan Mishev, the assistant on USAID's Women's Legal Protection Project attended the event On behalf of ESE.",

        "text":"The Spirit, the one who impresses on us the will of God and the love for Christ. It\u2019s not so much His prayer, but our prayer. You don\u2019t have to see God through the broken glasses of your family experience. Christ reveals a connection between the vertical and the horizontal relationship\u2014right in the middle of the Lord\u2019s Prayer. What a beautiful truth! \u201cOur Father\u201d says we can share in the inheritance He gave through Christ\u2014that we are a part of the heavenly family. The Bible says, \u201cIf ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father \u2026 give good things to them that ask Him\u201d (Matthew 7:11)? The phrase \u201cthe kingdom of God\u201d is found 70 times in the New Testament. We need to say, \u201cLord, teach us to pray.\u201d \u201cDeliver us\u201d takes us away from evil and separates us from it eternally. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses\u201d (Mark 11:25, 26 NKJV). It is the Spirit who gives the power to do the will of God. And so you have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit represented in the first three petitions of the Lord\u2019s Prayer. ADDRESSING OUR GOD AS A FAMILY In the garden of Gethsemane, facing separation from the father, Christ petitioned God three times with, \u201cNot My will, but yours, be done\u201d (Luke 22:42 NKJV). God has convicted me that my prayers are too selfish, and I need to keep Him and others first in mind when I go to the Father in prayer. \u201cFOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND THE GLORY, FOR EVER\u201d The central message in the book of Daniel is that the kingdoms and idols of the world, whether they are made of gold, silver, bronze, or clay will all disintegrate before the Rock of Ages\u2014the kingdom of God. It is the Spirit who gives the power to do the will of God. In the Bible, the priority is reversed. Likewise, the first great commandment is to love the Lord, and the second great commandment is to love your neighbor. We need to be willing to forgive one another, and God points this out to us repeatedly in Scripture. The whole purpose of the plan of salvation is to defend the glory of God. Some people think they can pray the Lord\u2019s Prayer and then sit back and do nothing, expecting Him to answer. Are you praying always? Recognize that it is essential to spend quality time with Christ in your personal and corporate prayers and devotions, so we can implement those changes in our lives that will glorify God. Take advantage of the \u201cdaily bread\u201d of God\u2019s Word, and communicate to God your desire to be transformed from selfish to selfless. You and I have no idea what\u2019s going on behind the spiritual veil, which is why we have to pray, \u201cThy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.\u201d You and I naturally have our wills twisted and confused by our carnal desires. The Christian\u2019s motive is to bring honor to God, to give Him the glory. This is how the devil works with temptation\u2014little compromises. In the Old Testament, His list of names includes: \u201cWonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father\u201d (Isaiah 9:6). He is powerful and omnipotent, yet He is also the all-sufficient provider. Taken together, He surely is the God of the universe ruling from heaven, but we can still approach Him personally as our Father. But when He made Adam, he took dust from the ground, formed it with His hands, and breathed life into it. He made humanity from the earth. Remember, though, that when we pray, \u201cGive us \u2026 our daily bread,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean that God expects us not to go out and earn it. Revisionists would have you believe that the signers of the Declaration of Independence were all pantheists, deists, or agnostics who didn\u2019t have a lot of time for God. That\u2019s why Satan hungers to be a god. When we pray the Lord\u2019s Prayer, it must be in a spirit of complete surrender. Now the name of God is a central issue in the great controversy between good and evil. The essence of prayer is bound up in loving God with all our hearts, for we cannot really love Him if we aren\u2019t getting to know Him. If we\u2019re not communicating our sorrows and our joys, even our most intimate secrets, how can we love Him? Love the Lord, then your neighbor, and then you. (If you need an easy way to remember, just think of J-O-Y. Thus the purpose of the Christian, by God\u2019s grace, is to defend the name of God as much as we can, to reveal who He really is. Bread represents many things in the Bible. But by the end of the prayer, the commander in charge said he was free to go. \u201cI believe your story,\u201d he said. Instead, the gospel says that we are to come just as we are to God, and He will forgive us. And our first petition to our God is \u201cHallowed be thy name.\u201d We need to say, \u201cLord, teach us to pray.\u201d \u201cIf you had not spent so much time at drill, you would not have performed so well during review.\u201d He then added, \u201cI can tell from the way you prayed that you are on regular speaking terms with God.\u201d It\u2019s not so much His prayer, but our prayer. When we pray for our daily bread, we\u2019re really asking God to supply the basic necessities of our everyday lives. Of course, Jesus is the perfect example of doing God\u2019s will here on the earth. Let\u2019s stand together and lift our voices to heaven so that we are more united in the brotherhood and sisterhood of Jesus. I\u2019m not sure how often that really means, but look at your own prayer life and see if it measures up. Daily bread, daily communion with the Lord, should be our top priority. Why do we not say, \u201cLord, give me a month\u2019s supply\u201d? Most of us don\u2019t fret from day to day that the refrigerator is going to be empty, so we don\u2019t often appreciate the implications of praying for daily bread. Without Him, we couldn\u2019t even come to the Father. I am powerless on my own,\u201d you are then giving Him the power to release His will in your life. The devil lives for pride, to bring glory to himself. How often do we need to be spiritually fed? I respectfully disagree with the notion that everything that happens is in accordance with the Creator\u2019s will. \u201cPlease, Lord, we know you don\u2019t want to tempt us. The times of our prayers should be frequent and regular, but even more important the content should be outward. Indeed, all the petitions in the Lord\u2019s Prayer are only possible because Christ is the power. However, God says, \u201cNow that you\u2019re forgiven, I expect you to forgive each other.\u201d I want you to take control. I surrender my will. We ought to be as concerned about the needs of others as much as, or more than, our own. I\u2019m giving myself to you. Instead, the gospel says that we are to come just as we are to God, and He will forgive us.",

        "text":"On the back very often a metal attached elements resembling \"ears\" can be found, through which the belt was passed, and thus they were fastened to the belt. Due to their complexity, they can be treated as a document of their time, a style related to customs and military needs, which should be seen as a whole. For example, during the 18 century, the Italian influence was especially noticeable in this type of objects, due to the performed compositions with dominant vegetative motifs such as naturalistically processed flowers, then vases with fruits or flowers which are characteristic of the late Baroque, but also other similar motifs. In this type of objects, on the side parts, there are often two small handles through which a chain or a narrow leather cord was threaded with which they were hung around the neck. This type of palaski - fishekli is essentially considered the newest. The \"palaski\" were closed with a simple locker, on which, in some objects, a kind of handle can be seen, made in an embroidery technique with various decorative motifs such as birds, zoomorphic and vegetative displays. These items could also be worn around the neck, but for that purpose a leather or metal strap was placed on them. Due to this property, the term \"pripojasnici\" (belted cartridge box) has been preserved in the wider Balkan cultural area. In essence, this type of objects in our country is known most often as \"palaski\" or \"fishekli\", and less often as \"enamluci\". They also differed in part in their shape, usually rectangular with flat sides, but there are also examples of semi-rounded, arched sides. Their presence and representation of these works slowly began to fade during the period of the establishment of the regular army, and especially after the withdrawal of the Ottoman army. Brass boxes from the museum collections The motifs were made in the technique of embossing and they essentially follow the Islamic or Christian iconography, depending on the owner or the client of the particular object. These items, which were intended for military use or as an indicator of the military dignity of the individual, are true masterpieces of the masters of that time. They were mainly made by goldsmith masters, of which the Bitola masters stood out in our area. In the wider Balkan cultural area, these objects, according to their specifics, were found under different terms, such as: \"palaski\", \"fisheklii\", \"enamluci\", \"pripojasnici\" etc. The \"palaski\" were of different sizes. What is interesting about this type of objects is the fact that according to the present motives they were a kind of mixture of various cultural, artistic and religious influences, which were visible in this area not solely with the arrival of the Ottomans, but also as a result of trade relations and influences with other European centers, which is especially noticeable among the Bitola masters. The decorative motifs in this type of objects were mostly geometric, made in the technique of engraving and embossing. This is evidenced by the numerous preserved objects of this type throughout the Balkans. The objects made by the masters from Skopje, Tetovo, Bitola, Debar, were dominated by depictions of Christian saints, but complex Islamic motifs as well. In addition to carrying amulets, soldiers often used them to store firearm cartridges, which is why they are also referred to as \"fiseklii\" (ammunition cartridge box).",

Prime Minister Zaev has stressed that it is very important for us that France is supporting North Macedonia's EU accession process with clearly set standards without losing any additional time.

Systems for gas liquefaction, which are considered by governments in Albania and Greece, i.e. the construction of such systems in Durr\u00ebs and Thessaloniki, from where, the gas would be transported in tankers, are alternative as well. We use about 20 percent from the existing gas we now get, and it can be increased to 50 percent for three or four years. In a situation that can be described as \"wishful thinking,\" this branch could pass through Macedonia and Serbia to Hungary and Austria, but if such plan is to be announced, Macedonia and Serbia would face an enormous pressure from the EU \u2013 stated the professor. \u2013 We can monitor the situation and we are working, worked and will be working on finding alternative solutions. Alternatives do exist, there is the pipeline TAP (Trans Adriatic Pipeline), which is projected to run 25 kilometers from the border between Macedonia and Greece and to which we could join \u2013 says Professor Konstantin Dimitrov, who is also President of the Center for Energy Efficiency. According to retired professor Tome Boshevski, the Government is the one to be searching for solutions for the gas supply to the country. After the newly developed situation with the construction of the pipeline South Stream, which was to supply the gas system in Macedonia, experts' opinions are divided. \u2013 Macedonia won't have any problems in the next five or six years. \u2013 With the permission of Greece, it is possible to build a pipeline which will pass through its territory to Italy, which would be the southern branch of the so-called South Stream, which was not as important put as the northern branch, which was to pass through Bulgaria and Serbia. We believe that there are such and, in the foreseeable future, the Government will inform on the progress on finding alternatives, i.e. finding other sources and approaches to gas supply for Macedonia \u2013 said Stavreski. The current situation is not good for the entire Balkans, even for Southeast Europe. According to some, Macedonia has enough gas for the next five or six years, and there are alternatives, while, according to others, it is a problem which the Government should seriously consider. At the request of META for a comment regarding the situation with South Stream, representatives of the state owned joint-stock company Macedonian Energy Resources quoted the statement given yesterday by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Zoran Stavreski, in which he said that the future of the project South Stream is in the hands of Russia and the European Union and Macedonia cannot affect this issue. \u2013 It is a problem that is not solved and it is the job of the Government to solve it. This option is also possible with the pipeline which Gazprom will now build in Turkey to the border of Greece, where a liquefaction system would be installed, a possibility announced by the Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Turkey a few days ago. There are alternatives for gas, but we should seriously work on them",

If left untreated, it can worsen in other situations, such as panic attacks, depressive syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, development of psychoactive substance dependence, social phobic disorder or other types of phobic disorder. 5 \u2013 All of these concerns are present daily and affect the functional ability of the individual and his or her ability to work. Patients are often overly concerned about their health, family or financial problems, death in the family or surroundings, problems with friends, problems with relationships with others, difficulties in the workplace, and so on. ANXIETY SHOULD BE TREATED ON TIME After prolonged use of sedatives there is an addiction and tolerance to them and often they become ineffective, warns d-r Chachev-Spanchevska. It often begins in childhood, and over time the disease progresses and manifests itself in middle age. Generalized anxiety disorder belongs to the group of anxiety disorders and is characterized by excessive, uncontrolled, often irrational care in daily functioning. In terms of therapy, the best results are achieved by the combined use of medications from the group of antidepressant cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, says d-r Chachev-Spanchevska. 3 \u2013 Physical symptoms require at least 3 of 6 \u2013 muscle cramping, cramps or cramping, tingling, headache, difficulty swallowing and breathing, fast heartbeat, sweating; They also often complain of a variety of physical difficulties \u2013 fatigue, headaches, nausea, vomiting, shaking hands and tensions, muscle strain, muscle aches, difficulty swallowing and breathing, decreased concentration, irritability, perspiration, restlessness, insomnia, heat waves, itching, difficulty controlling anxiety. With proper therapy, we manage to control the disease. Anxiety is a constant feeling of pressure, constriction, powerlessness to relax, lack of joy in life, says d-r Chachev-Spanchevska. She says excessive anxiety affects daily functioning, causing a feeling of near collapse. \u2013 The treatment should of course be carried out by a professional team of psychiatrists and psychologists. 4 \u2013 It is not about any other organic disease or comorbidity; Patients also often complain of a variety of physical difficulties \u2013 fatigue, headaches, nausea, vomiting, shaking hands and tensions, muscle tension and cramping, muscle aches, difficulty swallowing and breathing, decreased concentration, trembling, shaking, agitation, sweating, restlessness, insomnia, heat waves, itching, difficulty controlling anxiety. 1 \u2013 Excessive anxiety (constant worry over 6 months); When the disease develops, it can easily become chronic if left untreated and treated properly. If these symptoms persist for the last six months, then it is GAP. The condition occurs in all age groups, but is most common in middle-aged people. It is twice as common in the female population. Alcohol abuse is also common. Causes include genetic factors as a genetic predisposition that interact with environmental influences and psychological factors that can lead to disease. If these symptoms have been persistent for the last 6 months, then it is GAP- says the doctor. Scientists believe that there is a substantial impediment to the functioning of parts of the brain \u2013 the basal ganglia, which disrupt the concentration and exchange of protein molecules called neurotransmitters \u2013 she explains. It is advisable to learn some of the relaxation techniques, change of lifestyle and style, more physical activity, walks in nature. Because of the constant anxiety, patients often self-medicate for a longer period of time, which can further aggravate the condition \u2013 warns the doctor. SEDATIVES ADDICTION As d-r Bjanka Chachev-Spanchevska, a neuropsychiatrist at \"Re-Medika\" explains, symptoms last more than 6 months and are present daily.",

In their presentations, the representatives of the CCM, Lile Petrova and Ljupco Vasilevski explained the meaning of the employment contract as a prerequisite for eradication of undeclared work and gave a comparative analysis of national legislation with EU legislation. The launch of the campaign, for which propaganda materials (posters and flyers) have been prepared, was followed by a press conference on which the President Mitrevski stressed that the campaign will include a series of measures referring to trainings for the unemployed. Low tax revenues owed to the lack of contributions from wages, limits the capacity of the Government to introduce effective policies for the labor market and social protection. The high incidence of informal employment has various negative consequences on the economy, working conditions in general and the process of policy-making. The Federation of Trade Unions and the Youth Section of the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia on 2.11.2015 started a campaign to combat gray economy, titled \"Join in and say STOP to grey economy, say STOP to undeclared work\" within the Project \"Taxes, informal economy and corruption in the Western Balkan countries\", implemented by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the Pan-European Regional Council (PERC) and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO). Additionally, the large segment of the informal economy and the widespread practice of reporting lower wages create serious problems for the scope and financing of social security systems, thus depriving these workers and their families from protection against the significant social risks. It is estimated that the informal employment accounts for more than 22.5% of total employment in the country (58 811 out of 271 307 employed women and 93 993 out of 407 531 employed men). On the panel debate his address had the President of CCM, PhD Zhivko Mitrevski, the President of the Youth Section, M. Lidija Naskovska, representatives of the IPA Project: Support to the fight against undeclared work, Mr. Geoffrey Fieldhouse, team leader, Brian Kearney, KE2 and representatives from the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia, Lile Petrova, CCM and Ljupco Vasilevski RTUO Bitola. Also they presented the current situation in Macedonia regarding the undeclared work, its size, scope and nature as well as presentation of various campaigns on informal economy in Europe and the world. This campaign will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the fight against undeclared work in the country through a systematic and coordinated involvement of relevant institutional actors and social partners in the fight against undeclared work. - We start this campaign against this social evil, to combat illegal work. The analysis of previous studies has shown that approximately 22.5 percent of people are included in the informal economy in Macedonia, said, President Mitrevski. The President of CCM, PhD Zhivko Mitrevski noted that the formalization of the informal economy remains an area of high priority for the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia. The main objective of the panel debate is launching a campaign to combat grey economy and undeclared work, increasing the capacity and awareness among young people about this particular issue, learning ways of transition from informal to formal form of employment and strengthen the capacities of the various national actors involved in the fight against undeclared work.

        "text":"At the meeting in Tirana the WB leaders positively assessed the encouragement of the European Commission, the political and financial institutions of EU, the RCC, as well as the World Bank and other supporters of the European perspective in the region and extended the appreciation for implementation of initiatives arising from this process. The third meeting for enhancement of cooperation between the WB countries which takes place today in Tirana, started with the working part where President of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of Albania Edi Rama and the presidents of Montenegro and Serbia, Milo Djukanovic and Aleksandar Vucic, discussed the progress of implementation of the four freedoms in the region, as assessed on the previous two meetings in Ohrid and Novi Sad. The spirit of inclusiveness and the good neighbourly relations that stimulated this process has brought several benefits for the citizens of the region. On such note, it is worth to underline the recent decisions adopted within CEFTA during the Albanian presidency, especially the decision for automatic recognition of the authorized economic operators, as well as the unification of the procedures for issuance of work permits for all citizens in all countries in the region. The tragedy caused by the earthquake in Durres stimulated the idea for the mutual support in natural disasters and emergencies to be included as another pillar in enhancement of the cooperation in the region and in that line, in February in Belgrade, the competent institutions of each of the WB countries will sign the Durres Protocol for cooperation of the Directorates for protection and rescue. The main objective of these One Stop Shops i.e. border controls with one stop is to soon become Non Stop Shop i.e. border crossings without stops. Another contribution to this procedure will be the implementation of the paperless system that is to simplify the customs procedures. Stimulated by the initiative for regional cooperation, the negotiations between Republic of Serbia and Republic of North Macedonia have been completed and very soon the construction of the new border crossing Lojane \u2013 Miratovac is expected to start until the next meeting of this initiative which will take place in Belgrade; the customs administrations of North Macedonia and Albania will sign the Agreement for One Stop Shop for the border crossing Kjafasan, as the one with Serbia on the border crossing Tabanovce. The leaders of the participating countries reaffirmed the view that this initiative is intended to reinforce the cooperation and to alleviate and accelerate the process of European integration for each of the WB countries and that it is open for all 6 countries in the region.",

Petrit Sarachini's CIVIL \u2013 Center for Freedom organization which was observing the pre-election period, stressed that during the 21-day political campaign there were at least four efforts for organized action by orchestrated publishing of content with hate speech, disinformation, false news on online media and social networks with the goal to discredit, efforts for attacks on political opponents, and often attacks on persons who didn't participate in the election process.

Most of the respondents think that the attractiveness of journalism as a profession is dropping constantly, the perception of low wages and bad working conditions is dominating, there is mistrust towards journalism as a profession including a drop in the journalistic standards and the freedom of expression. The findings have also shown that the citizens have an equal mistrust towards informing themselves both from the broadcasters and the portals. Internet media aren't subject to a media regulation and most of them which have no transparent ownership aren't part of the self-regulatory instruments. An interesting conclusion from this presentation is that 72% of the respondents receive the information through the Internet, but are checking these through the interactions with friends i.e. people from the closest surroundings, and not through their own authentic channels. Regarding the freedom of speech, Stefanovski also said that a huge step forward was made in the period from 2017 until today, but still, even according to the report from the European Commission, there is more that needs to be done. Half of the respondents consider that the political parties are the biggest source of pressure,\" concludes the research conducted by Metamorphosis and Eurothink, and was presented by Ivan Stefanovski. Regarding investigative journalism, it was determined that both financial capacities and the human resources are lacking, and almost all of the respondents have replied that additional skills, knowledge, and journalist training are necessary including greater media literacy for the citizens. The worsened financial situation of the media reflects with a low-quality journalism content, weak products, and accordingly low interest for employment.\t\u041b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0438, \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0438, \u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u043e\u0432\u0430\u0430 \u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430. During the debate the importance of social responsibility on part of the big advertisers was stressed i.e. they should be aware of where they are advertising themselves and to support the true values of professional journalism. About 60% of the respondents have replied that the news from the portals is politically colored, consider the events as constructed, and untrue stories are presented. The hate speech also endures because of the impunity and the passiveness of the authorized institutions,\" said Nikodinoska. Gjorgji Mitrevski from the Research Institute on Social Development RESIS presented researches made by the Agency for Audio and Audio-Visual Services including OSCE where they presented the habits of the citizens in relation to traditional media and the Internet as sources of information, including the age group that is using the Internet as a source of information. Vesna Nikodinoska presented the research conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Media \u2013 MIM which states that hate speech, propaganda, and disinformation have marked a long and dark period in the political and media spheres during the period between 2008-2016, and these were again evident during this year as they are on the rise especially on the Internet. Very often, the hatred from the virtual world is spilling into reality resulting in incidents, threats with weapons, vandalism, attacks, violence. She even stressed the role of companies as advertisers at online media and noticed those that continuously violate professional and ethical standards have more adverts than the informative portals. During the discussion, prof. \u017daneta Trpeska, PhD, from RESIS pointed out the importance of the integrity of research efforts, and informed the public that RESIS has started an initiative for adoption of code of ethics relevant to research activities within the Media Literacy Network, which would cover aspects of protection of human rights of people being surveyed, as well as aspects of transparency and accountability towards the audience. He also said that we have little but not enough successes for self-regulation among the media since those that are creating provocative content are not part of the self-regulatory mechanisms. Over 50% of the respondents are checking the truthfulness through conversations with close acquaintances and only a small percentage is checking them through research and comparison with relevant sources,\" said Mitrevski. The state hasn't neither enough mechanisms to deal with disinformation nor that mechanism that we have at our disposal are used accordingly to decrease the series of felonies,\" said Sarachini.",
