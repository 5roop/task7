I suggest you try to use any beer you can find, even if it is not dark. This beer had very little alcohol in it, it was dark and sweet and smelled like a drink called Maltina from West Africa. Meanwhile, mash 2 avocados with a crushed clove of garlic, add lime or lemon juice, mix and season with salt and black pepper. Hope you will make us discover the food of this country!! We would be delighted if you could add your blog to Petitchef so that our users can, as us, enjoy your recipes. These delicious babies need nothing more than a salad on the side and another cold beer! As I promised couple of days ago, here is what we ate the mexican street salad with. Cut up the chicken in strips, put in a bowl and add the beer, sliced garlic gloves, splash of oil, the cayenne, the origano and a pinch of salt. 2 avocados 1 clove garlic juice of 1 lime or lemon salt, black pepper Cook until the chicken has browned nicely and caramelized. If you, like me, are new to getting more out of beer than refreshment in summer, then this is the perfect simple starting recipe. Let marinade for few hours or overnight in the fridge. Take the chicken strips out of the marinad, shake off the excess liquid and cook over high heat in a pan with a splash of oil. These chicken tacos are simply delicious. We would like to add it to the Petitchef.com. The chicken tastes amazing, the beer marinade keeping the inside moist and juicy, and making the outside sweet, sticky and caramelized.",

Lukashenko also said he had ordered officials to close the country's border with Ukraine to prevent \"a huge amount of arms\" from coming into Belarus.

        "text":"The motives for that are not being hidden. The Macedonian Association of Journalists was founded in November 2002, two months after the parliamentary elections which brought a change in the government and turned the then governing VMRO-DPMNE into opposition. Around twenty journalists participated in the reactivation, including Mirka Velinovska, Janko Ilkovski, Dejan Nikolovski and Gradimir Markovski. Instead, words like \"parallel\" and \"counter-organizations\" are the preferred choice. The documents and testimonies on which SSNM bases its research on this topic show that the parallel media organizations in Macedonia have been revived or established for the sole purpose of silencing the voice of media organizations critical of the government. We reached the president Dimishkova on her mobile phone and we send her questions which she agreed to answer in relation to the operation of MAN and the media situation in the country.

An Inactive Organization Stipulated in the Law Both NSNM and MAN refer to the International and the European Federations of Journalists in their statutes. MAN even went a step further and put the IFJ's logo on its website, which is allowed only to the members of this organization. In November 2014, ZNM and MAN became legally bound to submit their membership information to the Ministry of Information Society in order to determine how representative they are. Today MAN is an active organization, so it seems that the \"inactivity\" was not even then considered a serious obstacle. MAN urgently demands \"AJM and the Trade Union of Journalists as exponents of SDSD to stop pressuring the media and to stop acting as a censor in order to come to power without elections\" says the last public announcement of MAN. But, regardless of the description, the key purpose of these organizations is same everywhere \u2013 to counter, neutralize the work of the existing critical organizations or that a certain party deems as problematic. In the Executive Board of MAN since its foundations is also Dejan Nikolovski (NETPRES). We also tried to locate the offices though the phonebook of Telekom, but we were informed that there was no journalist association at the given address. After the expiration of the mandate, the president of MAN, a journalist in the Macedonian Information Agency, becomes part of the main threesome of the ambitious operation for destroying the NGO sector under the code name \"desorosoization\". The proposal presented at the meeting with journalists of 30 November expressly resulted into \"founding\" assemblies of unions in the portal \"Kurir\" on Friday, 18 December, and in TV Sitel and the weekly Republika on Monday, 21 December 2015. The epilogue from MAN's revival is that the new media laws gave them the right to propose one member for the new Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services and the Program Council of MRT each. More precisely, they demanded to take part in the dialogue between ZNM and the Government and the right to nominate their member in the Broadcasting Council (BC) or to have their member share the mandate with the member proposed by ZNM. The first elected president of MAN was Ilija Maksimovski, who was also the owner of the weekly \"Nacional\" at which address the association was registered. Our search for information about the operation of MAN brought us to the document from the Central Registry according to which in 2013 the status of MAN was \u2013 inactive. Search Macedonia's Media Potemkin Villages The pacification of the existing critical organizations considered problematic by the government stared right in the media sector. Only a few years after its foundation, the Council of Ethics becomes a protagonist in the parallel media reality, is labeled as \"another one of the clones or products of SDSM and the Foundation SOROS in Macedonia\". MAN even went a step further and put the IFJ's logo on its website, which is allowed only to the members of this organization. We Don't Need Media Reforms However, even without such evidence, which is for now hidden from the public eye, the time of foundation and the manner of operation are sufficient indicators of the nature of this parallel association. Vice-presidents are Cvetin Chilimanov (MIA) and Petar Tsalev (MRTV). President is Slagjana Dimishkovska (VEST). The last announcement to the public published on the website of the Macedonian Association of Journalists is from 14 March last year as a reaction to the joint position of five media organizations which united in their demand of immediate media reforms. Towards the end of 2013, MAN gets financial help from the Mayor of the Municipality of Karposh, Stevcho Jakimovski who, after entering into coalition with VMRO DMPNE, decided to donate 500.000 denars or around 8 thousand euros for acquisition of IT equipment for the association As 90 percent of the media workers in the TV stations are members of the Macedonian Association of Journalists, MAN thinks that there is no need for reforms in the media sector. The Council of Ethics is the youngest media organization, formed in December 2013. The offices are located in the building of the former \"Nova Makedonija\", the current location of the European University of Bojo Andreevski, who is also the owner of the daily Vecer with offices in the same building. Then the Government apparently withdrew the proposal, but at the beginning of 2012 started leaking information that the law was being drafted and would be placed under public scrutiny. The first elected president of MAN was Ilija Maksimovski, who was also the owner of the weekly \"Nacional\" at which address the association was registered. The Dialogue and the Media Laws Brought MAN TO Life If somebody refused, there was a problem\", he said. This organization played a key part in the negotiations for media reforms led after the Przino Agreement by aggressively exhausting the critical though and by defocusing from the real arguments. The registration documents are submitted to the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy on 28 June 2016. After the foundation of the affiliates in \"Kurir\", TV Sitel and Republika, there were more complaints from colleagues form several pro-government media about the pressure exerted on them to become members of the new union, for which SSNM issued a public reaction. Towards the end of 2013, MAN gets financial help from the Mayor of the Municipality of Karposh, Stevcho Jakimovski who, after entering into coalition with VMRO DMPNE, decided to donate 500.000 denars or around 8 thousand euros for acquisition of IT equipment for the association It is impossible to determine from the documents SSNM has at its disposal whether these assemblies did actually take place or there is only one founding act i.e. an identical text with empty space for the name of the media, and even the same date. However, what is interesting is that the new organization for protection of workers' rights of journalists is not rushing to register. It didn't, for example, stop the Ministry of Information Society to not only hold consultations with this association, but also to fight for it to get a guaranteed seat in the constitution of the new regulative body \u2013 The Agency for Media and the Council of MRTV, including in all conferences and meetings the topic of discussion of which was the media, one of which was the public debate about laws in the Parliament. Pavlovikj \u2013 Latas is the general secretary of MAN from its foundation, as indicated at the old website of the association. As 90 percent of the media workers in the TV stations are members of the Macedonian Association of Journalists, MAN thinks that there is no need for reforms in the media sector. The editor-in-chief came and said that all admission forms to the last must be signed and returned says one witness about the way members were recruited in the new union organization. The last announcement to the public published on the website of the Macedonian Association of Journalists is from 14 March last year as a reaction to the joint position of five media organizations which united in their demand of immediate media reforms. However, if you search for this protector of the \"seventh force\" at the given address, you will find no board or sign with its name. After less than a month, on 14 April 2012, the new management of MAN claims that they have \"numerous journalistic membership\" and sends a letter to the Government requesting conditions for \"their adequate representation\". The parallel trade union is the fastest registered organization in the union history in Macedonia. Relying on the available documents such as the Statute of MAN published on their website, it is evident that the last Assembly was held on 16 March 2012. By the words of the colleagues who participated in the foundation of MAN, this association was a result of the dissatisfaction within the media community with the operation of ZNM at the time. The freshly returned minister from within VMRO DPMNE, Dime Spasov, issues a decision for registration of the union ten days after the submitted request. Namely, the revival of MAN coincides with the period of the planned adoption of the first Law on Media, at the time under the competence of the Ministry of Transport and Connections, the Minister of which was Mile Janakievski. This address remains the official address of MAN. Journalists from pro-government media say that the manner of acquiring members in the union was identical to that of MAN. We tried to find the office of the Independent Union, but there was no sign of the new association. This results from the attempt in November 2016, when more than 80 mainly local and regional media become members, to overtake the control over this self-regulatory body. This new union does not have a website and its founding assembly was neither public nor transparent. The reasons and motives for the revival of MAN are hidden in the wiretapped conversations consisted in Zaev's \"bombs\". MAN was reactivated just before the public debate announced by Janakievski. In the Executive Board of MAN since its foundations is also Dejan Nikolovski (NETPRES). The current board, according to MAN's website, includes Ivona Talevska (TV Sitel), Maja Damjanovska (TV Kanal 5), Gradimir Markovski (TV Nova), Katerina Neshkova (Dnevnik), Gjorgji Tomikj (TV Kanal 5), Martin Pushevski (MRTV) and Filip Momirovski (TV Sitel). The address of this association has not been changed since then \u2013 Blvd. The Macedonian Association of Journalists was founded in November 2002, two months after the parliamentary elections which brought a change in the government and turned the then governing VMRO-DPMNE into opposition. One of the editors came and distributed admission forms to all journalists, which meant that we all had to sign them.\t\u0414\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435 \u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0434 \u0443\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0430\u0442. In this way, practically the three organizations dealing with freedom of expression, professional and workers' rights and journalistic standards would be covered with parallel organizations which, like Potemkin villages\", are more or less successful facades of the government's ambition to cover authentic media voices. At the time he was disclosing them, Zaev confirmed to members of SSNM and ZNM that there were conversations which make clear that the foundation and the operation of MAN had been in coordination with the Government The current board, according to MAN's website, includes Ivona Talevska (TV Sitel), Maja Damjanovska (TV Kanal 5), Gradimir Markovski (TV Nova), Katerina Neshkova (Dnevnik), Gjorgji Tomikj (TV Kanal 5), Martin Pushevski (MRTV) and Filip Momirovski (TV Sitel). So far, the new union association has issued no announcement or a press conference in order to present their mission and the objective of their formation. Since, despite referring to their principles in the Statute, the International Federation of Journalists is framed in a negative context. The plans for the new Law on Media however did not realize in April, as the issue took the back seat, i.e. Vanhoutte \u2013 A Motiv for a Parallel Trade Union Following the intervention from Brussels, MAN removed the logo of the biggest federation of journalist unions and association in which ZNM and SSNM are fulltime members. The address of this association has not been changed since then \u2013 Blvd. \"St. Kliment Ohridski\" bb in Skopje or, as specified in the registration published in the Official Gazette, it is the same address as that of the now non-existent weekly \"Nacional\". In the middle of the debate and the resistance against media laws in 2013, an inactive journalist association \u2013 MAN, registered in 2002, after more than a decade of hibernation was revived and firmly stood behind the government's initiative to adopt a media law. The three affiliates are formally structured in a branch union led by Gradimir Markovikj, a journalist in TV NOVA and member of the EB of MAN, on Saturday 16 April 2016, two days after the dramatic announcement of MAN in which ZNM and SSNM are labeled as \"exponents of SDSM\". Since its Foundation, MAN is the Opponent of ZNM The attempt for the semi-hidden passing of this law faced a united resistance from media organizations at the public debate held in the sports hall \"Boris Trajkovski\" in December 2011. If all these media and organizations got accepted, they would have representatives in the Assembly of the Council and could vote and overvote decisions of the managements under the complete control of SOROS, writes Vecer at the beginning of December 2016. After the efforts for inter-party negotiations for the media were reduced to candidates for the ad-hoc regulatory body for monitoring of the elections, which was rejected by AJM and the other media organizations, the president of MAN Dimishkovska and the vice-president Chilimanov became members of this interim body, upon proposal from VRMO DMPNE. Despite the fact that the first people of the new union are also members of the management of MAN, the closeness of these media organizations is obvious from their statutes. According to SSNM's information, among the materials handed over to the Special Prosecutor's Office, there is a separate folder titled \"MAN\" which contains wiretapped conversations of higher government officials which took part in the establishment of this association as an opponent to ZNM. The address of the seat is St. 1732 number 2 in Skopje, dividing the Chinese Wall in the City Park and the River Vardar bank. Namely, the revival of MAN coincides with the period of the planned adoption of the first Law on Media, at the time under the competence of the Ministry of Transport and Connections, the Minister of which was Mile Janakievski. At MAN's website, the only contact phone number is the mobile phone number of the president Slagjana Dimishkova. It didn't, for example, stop the Ministry of Information Society to not only hold consultations with this association, but also to fight for it to get a guaranteed seat in the constitution of the new regulative body \u2013 The Agency for Media and the Council of MRTV, including in all conferences and meetings the topic of discussion of which was the media, one of which was the public debate about laws in the Parliament. In our country, this method, which culminated with the formation of the infamous organization Stop Operation Soros, seems to have appeared right in the media sector. The offices are located in the building of the former \"Nova Makedonija\", the current location of the European University of Bojo Andreevski, who is also the owner of the daily Vecer with offices in the same building. The Close Ties of MAN with the New Union However, we received no reply from her or anyone else. Namely, is seems that the only difference between them is the name of the organization, the address and the laws under which they are formed \u2013 MAN under the Law on Associations and the Union (NSNM) under the Law on Labor Relations At the session held on 16 March 2012, presided by Dragan Pavlovikj Latas, as the reason for the reactivation and reorganization of the association is given, among other things, \"the current events related to the legislation regarding journalistic work\". This text coincides with the information leaked in the media community that formation of a new counter-council of ethics is already planned. The terms government-organized non-governmental organizations GONGO and party-organized non-governmental organizations PONGO are rarely used in Macedonia. How MAN acquired their members is best described by a colleague form TV Sitel, who asked to remain anonymous. The same address is shared by \"Ladna' and \"Dobra Voda\", i.e. the company \"Margoni DOO Skopje\" related to the owner of TV Sitel, Ljubisav Ivanov Tsingo. Since, during the negotiations for the media of the \"Przino Four\", and upon the proposal of the facilitator Peter Vanhoutte, the union of journalists was among the organizations which could nominate members of the Council of the Agency for Audiovisual Services, the intention to establish is counterpart materialized. ZNM issued a public reaction at the time following complaints from the regional centers about pressure being exerted on the employees to become members in the other journalist organization.",

The Court took the present decision in the following composition: Dr Trendafil Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mrs Liljana Ingilizova-Ristova, Mrs Vera Markova, Mr Branko Naumoski, Mr Igor Spirovski, Dr Gzime Starova, and Dr Zoran Sulejmanov. According to the Court, the legal solution of paragraph 1 in Article 145 of the Law, in contradiction with the constitutional guarantee of Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, which means an obligation for the employer to create conditions for the worker to use annual leave and to pay for that leave, the legislator prescribes a possibility for the employer to pay compensation to the worker for the unused days of annual leave, instead of enabling him to use paid annual leave, that is to replace the use of annual leave with pecuniary compensation. As the said legal provision means deprivation of the constitutionally prescribed right of workers to use paid annual leave, which they may not waive, the Court found that Article 145 paragraph 1 of the Law is not in agreement with Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution. According to the Court, the legal solution of paragraph 1 in Article 145 of the Law, in contradiction with the constitutional guarantee of Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, which means an obligation for the employer to create conditions for the worker to use annual leave and to pay for that leave, the legislator prescribes a possibility for the employer to pay compensation to the worker for the unused days of annual leave, instead of enabling him to use paid annual leave, that is to replace the use of annual leave with pecuniary compensation. This decision shall generate legal effects from the date of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\". Under paragraph 2 of the same article, any agreements with which the worker would waive his right to an annual leave or the compensation for the annual leave in the cases of paragraph 1 of this article are null and void. As the said legal provision means deprivation of the constitutionally prescribed right of workers to use paid annual leave, which they may not waive, the Court found that Article 145 paragraph 1 of the Law is not in agreement with Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution. Pursuant to Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, every employee has the right to a paid daily, weekly and annual leave. On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Book of Procedures of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 13 May 2009, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following Upon the initiative submitted by the Association of Trade Unions of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.200\/2008 of 4 March 2009 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions in the Law noted in item 1 of the present Decision, as there was a well-founded question raised regarding their agreement with the Constitution. This decision shall generate legal effects from the date of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\". The contested Article 145 paragraph 1 of this Law establishes the ground and the amount for payment of the unused part of the annual leave. Upon the initiative submitted by the Association of Trade Unions of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.200\/2008 of 4 March 2009 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions in the Law noted in item 1 of the present Decision, as there was a well-founded question raised regarding their agreement with the Constitution. Accordingly, the Court found the further existence of these provisions in the legal order to be unconstitutional. On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Book of Procedures of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 13 May 2009, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following Accordingly, the Court found the further existence of these provisions in the legal order to be unconstitutional.

Under Article 8 paragraph 1, lines 3 and 8 of the Constitution, the rule of law and humanism, social justice and solidarity are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. For the same reasons, the Court judged that any further existence of the heading before the contested Article 145, which reads: \"Payment of the unused part of annual leave\" would also mean violation of the principle of the rule of law. Thus, it is defined that if the employer has not enabled to the worker to use the annual leave, the worker has the right to compensation for the unused days of annual leave, in the amount of an average salary of the workers for those days. At its session the Court found that the heading before Article 145 of the Law on Working Relations reads as follows: \"Payment for the unused part of the annual leave\". The Court took the present decision in the following composition: Dr Trendafil Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mrs Liljana Ingilizova-Ristova, Mrs Vera Markova, Mr Branko Naumoski, Mr Igor Spirovski, Dr Gzime Starova, and Dr Zoran Sulejmanov.

Such provision leaves room for interpretation in the sense that if the employer finds it more profitable he may replace the worker's annual leave with payment of pecuniary compensation without any sanctions whatsoever. Pursuant to Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, every employee has the right to a paid daily, weekly and annual leave. The Court also established that under Article 145 paragraph 1 of this Law, if the employer fails to enable the worker to use his annual leave the worker has the right to compensation for the unused days of the annual leave, in the amount of the worker's average salary for those days. Pursuant to Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, every employee has the right to a paid daily, weekly and annual leave. Given that Article 145 paragraph 2 of the Law in the part \"or from compensation for the annual leave in the case of paragraph 1 of this article\" follows the legal destiny of paragraph 1 of this article, the Court assessed that any further existence of this part of the provision would mean violation of the principle of the rule of law, defined in Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution.

As the said legal provision means deprivation of the constitutionally prescribed right of workers to use paid annual leave, which they may not waive, the Court found that Article 145 paragraph 1 of the Law is not in agreement with Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution. Upon the initiative submitted by the Association of Trade Unions of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.200\/2008 of 4 March 2009 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions in the Law noted in item 1 of the present Decision, as there was a well-founded question raised regarding their agreement with the Constitution.

The Law on Working Relations regulates the working relations between workers and employers that are established with the conclusion of an employment contract (Article 1 paragraph 1). On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Book of Procedures of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 13 May 2009, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following The contested Article 145 paragraph 1 of this Law establishes the ground and the amount for payment of the unused part of the annual leave. The Court also established that under Article 145 paragraph 1 of this Law, if the employer fails to enable the worker to use his annual leave the worker has the right to compensation for the unused days of the annual leave, in the amount of the worker's average salary for those days. At its session the Court found that the heading before Article 145 of the Law on Working Relations reads as follows: \"Payment for the unused part of the annual leave\".

According to the Court, the legal solution of paragraph 1 in Article 145 of the Law, in contradiction with the constitutional guarantee of Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, which means an obligation for the employer to create conditions for the worker to use annual leave and to pay for that leave, the legislator prescribes a possibility for the employer to pay compensation to the worker for the unused days of annual leave, instead of enabling him to use paid annual leave, that is to replace the use of annual leave with pecuniary compensation. Pursuant to Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, every employee has the right to a paid daily, weekly and annual leave. On the basis of the aforementioned, the Court decided as in item 1 of the present Decision.

Thus, it is defined that if the employer has not enabled to the worker to use the annual leave, the worker has the right to compensation for the unused days of annual leave, in the amount of an average salary of the workers for those days. Accordingly, the Court found the further existence of these provisions in the legal order to be unconstitutional. Under paragraph 5 of the same article, the exercise of the rights of employees and their position are regulated by law and collective agreements. Such provision leaves room for interpretation in the sense that if the employer finds it more profitable he may replace the worker's annual leave with payment of pecuniary compensation without any sanctions whatsoever. This decision shall generate legal effects from the date of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\". Employees cannot waive these rights. Upon the initiative submitted by the Association of Trade Unions of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.200\/2008 of 4 March 2009 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions in the Law noted in item 1 of the present Decision, as there was a well-founded question raised regarding their agreement with the Constitution.

According to the Court, the legal solution of paragraph 1 in Article 145 of the Law, in contradiction with the constitutional guarantee of Article 32 paragraph 4 of the Constitution, which means an obligation for the employer to create conditions for the worker to use annual leave and to pay for that leave, the legislator prescribes a possibility for the employer to pay compensation to the worker for the unused days of annual leave, instead of enabling him to use paid annual leave, that is to replace the use of annual leave with pecuniary compensation. Such provision leaves room for interpretation in the sense that if the employer finds it more profitable he may replace the worker's annual leave with payment of pecuniary compensation without any sanctions whatsoever. Upon the initiative submitted by the Association of Trade Unions of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.200\/2008 of 4 March 2009 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions in the Law noted in item 1 of the present Decision, as there was a well-founded question raised regarding their agreement with the Constitution. The contested Article 145 paragraph 1 of this Law establishes the ground and the amount for payment of the unused part of the annual leave. The Court took the present decision in the following composition: Dr Trendafil Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mrs Liljana Ingilizova-Ristova, Mrs Vera Markova, Mr Branko Naumoski, Mr Igor Spirovski, Dr Gzime Starova, and Dr Zoran Sulejmanov. Given that Article 145 paragraph 2 of the Law in the part \"or from compensation for the annual leave in the case of paragraph 1 of this article\" follows the legal destiny of paragraph 1 of this article, the Court assessed that any further existence of this part of the provision would mean violation of the principle of the rule of law, defined in Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. Upon the initiative submitted by the Association of Trade Unions of Macedonia, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia with its Resolution U.no.200\/2008 of 4 March 2009 instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions in the Law noted in item 1 of the present Decision, as there was a well-founded question raised regarding their agreement with the Constitution.

At least six websites, which are prone to reporting news with a propaganda intent in favour of the USA Republican Party Presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been discovered to be registered by Macedonians living in Veles!

Mario Petrushev, however, who is the owner of worldpoliticus.com, introduced himself as a student of computer science, and pointed out that the website works for financial compensation from internet advertising and from \"Google\". If you are interested, I think Trump will win, and become a presidential candidate\", he said before adding briefly \"This is all for a bit of fun really\". I really don't know if what I translate from other web-sites is true or not, I am only doing this because of the Google Ads\" said Indov. He says he does not personally know other people who have similar portals, but he had found them on the internet and knew of them. Although Indov claimed, over the telephone, that he does not know who the real owners of the domains are, the domains that are publishing pro-Trump propaganda, it mysteriously transpired, the owner of the usenewsflash.com domain, changed names, from Miron Brezev to an anonymous owner who just happened to live at the same address as the owner of \"usadailypolitics.com\" in the state of Utah, USA. According to the owners of these websites Veles is full of such websites, and similar \"portals\" looking for more clicks which means more profits. I have been working on the portal for a month now, before that I had others, but they weren't successful, so I decided to create a portal which would affirm Trump's politics, because I think he will win, says Petrushev.

        "text":"The health care system itself is all too often overrun with coercive treatment and violations of patients' rights to consensual treatment and confidentiality. Persons for protection of patients' rights in outpatient health care facilities A quota system in Russia motivates police to reach target numbers of drug-related convictions, resulting in countless arbitrary arrests, while in Indonesia, drug-using populations are subjected to lengthy pretrial detention and extortion at the hands of police and prison guards. Sex workers in Kenya and South Africa face high levels of police violence and harassment and have nowhere to turn for protection from abuse. The Republic of Macedonia, after 22 years since the independence, has failed to establish a legitimate, continuous and non-selective process of citizen participation in the operation of the local self-governments. State Commission for promotion of patients' rights This right is defined for the first time by the World Health Organization as \"a right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\". The findings from the research on the level of establishment and operation of the legally set mechanisms for protection of patients' rights indicate evident stagnation in the implementation of the Law on the protection of patients' rights. We are especially dedicated to the work in the area of promotion and improvement of the health and women's human rights. Councilors for protection of patients' rights in inpatient health care facilities People with intellectual disability have the equal right to access and use the services which are provided within the framework of the health care facilities as well as any other citizen in the country. The Association for Emancipation, Solidarity and Equality of Women-ESE develops and assists the women's and civic leadership for promotion and implementation of human rights and social justice in our society since 1995. Only 25% of the units of local self-government have instituted a commission for promotion of patients' rights. Local Commissions for promotion of patients' rights By promoting and advancing the human rights, we improve the social and economic justice. After 15 years since the ratification of the European Charter of Local Self-Government and 8 years since the establishment of self-governing and independent units of the local self-government, the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia still only qualify as constituents and are not actively involved in the budget process or in the process of making decisions implemented at local level, although there are legal possibilities for this. The majority of the outpatient health care facilities have appointed persons for protection of patients' rights. Such violations have a particularly harsh impact on individuals whose health is already compromised and who find themselves excluded from civic participation. Office for assistance in the Health Insurance Fund The Minister of Health has not appointed\/authorized person for protection of patients' rights in the Ministry of Health For millions of people around the world, human rights violations are part and parcel of everyday life\u2013ranging from sexual violence, discrimination in access to housing, and denial of child support, to unfair dismissal from employment, police harassment, and arbitrary detention. Thus, the following conclusions were drawn from the conducted analysis regarding the establishment and operation of each mechanism for protection of patients' rights: The right to health is closely linked to the protection of patients' rights which represent a set of rights, responsibilities and obligations under which individuals seek and receive health care services. People living with HIV are frequently dismissed from employment and suffer abandonment and violence based on their status; in Kenya and Uganda, women are often forced into the streets with their children when their husbands die of AIDS, their property rights all but illusory. The Health Insurance Fund of the Republic of Macedonia set up offices for assistance to insured patients for the implementation and protection of their rights regarding health insurance in most of its regional offices. Only part of the instituted commissions is functional. Councilors for protection of patients' rights are appointed in 5 out of the 56 inpatient public health care facilities, whereby none is appointed in the inpatient health care facilities located in the eastern part of the Republic of Macedonia. We are especially dedicated to the work in the area of promotion and improvement of the health and women's human rights. In cooperation with 10 other civic organizations, and supported by the Foundations Open Society from New York and Macedonia, we prepared this submission as part of the second reporting cycle of RM to the Universal Periodic Review, whereby we indicate the problems and recommendations for improvement of the health of Roma people, people living with HIV\/AIDS, LGBT population, drug users, sexual workers, women, people with intellectual disability and victims of human trafficking. Members of Macedonia's Roma population, in particular, frequently face outright denial of health care services, in addition to misinformation and abuse. Their marginalization in the social and public life has a negative impact on the level of exercise of the rights regulated within the health laws, including the Law on health care, Law on health insurance and Law on protection of patients' rights. ; HOPS- Healthy Options Project Skopje; LGBTI Centre for support \u2013 Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, Macedonia; National Roma Centrum; Republic centre for support of persons with intellectual disability \u2013 Poraka; Roma Resource Centre; Roma Organization for multicultural affirmation - ROMA SOS Prilep; Open Gate \u2013 La strada. The right to health is an internationally recognized right. In Kenya, people who use drugs routinely face exaggerated criminal charges and heavy sentences, which contribute to their marginalization from society.",

If in the case of the Kulevski family, the monitoring and control over the exercise of their parental right was carried out, the question arises, why their parental right was not previously revoked but instead proceedings to revoke the parental right was carried out afterwards, ie after the accident happened. The First Children's Embassy in the world Megjashi reacts to the decision to revoke the parental rights of Kuleski familySunday, March 14, 2010 21:29 Julian The First Children's Embassy in the world Megjashi repeatedly has been asking the Social Work Centres to first monitor the parental right, and then if it is determined that there is improper performance of the parental right to revoke the same, ie to start proceedings for revocation. They should have strengthened inspections and controls and to take appropriate preventive measures in families at risk. The article 3, paragraph 2 of this Convention states: \"States Parties undertake to ensure child protection and care necessary for his welfare, taking into account the rights and obligations of his parents, legal guardians or other individuals legally responsible for the child and for that purpose shall take all necessary legislative measures\". The social workers need to be regularly onsite, to contact these families, to work with them in order to provide a secure living environment for proper growth and development of the children, to give aid and so on. The First Children's Embassy in the world Megjashi has repeatedly criticized the irregular and late intervention for enhanced supervision and inspection in the exercise of parental rights for the families at risk and dysfunctional families. Revocation of the parental right should be done as a prevention, not after serious injuries and consequences occur on the children or death caused by violence by the parents or parental neglect. Centres for social work should be more mobile, more effective and they should continuously monitor the situation of possible abuse and prevention of life threatening consequences against the children in families at risk by taking appropriate preventive measures. The centres should promptly and properly react in the prevention and protection of the children. The parents of the children from the families at risk should not be solely blamed.",

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the articular cartilage accompanied by an inflammatory component. The advantage of this method is that it is biologic and autologous and can be safely repeated many times. In the treatment of osteoarthritis, or its underlying symptom, in addition to medication therapy and physical-rehabilitation procedures, intra-articular injections are important. Its action is to utilize the growth factors found in platelets that act on the immune response and reduce inflammation in the joint. PRP \u2013 platelet rich plasma \u2013 is made from the patient's own blood, which is appropriately taken from a vein, centrifuged, and prepared by injection. Intra-articular injections are administered in sterile conditions \u2013 sterile gloves and sterile cleaning and insulation of the treated joint. Types of intra-articular injections Due to possible side effects it is not recommended to use them more than twice a year in the same joint. There are several types of intra-articular injections and the orthopedic specialist will determine which injection is appropriate for treatment depending on the progression of osteoarthritis, the age of the patient, body building, activity, lifestyle and eventual comorbidities. Hyaluronan preparations help the joint fluid to regain its normal properties and act as lubricants and shock absorbers, i.e. as a barrier to inflammatory cells in the joint, and can even stimulate the joint to begin to heal more naturally. The main symptom of osteoarthritis is pain, followed by decreased joint mobility which significantly affects the quality of life. Commonly used in the treatment of knee joints, it is recommended to give them once to twice a year. Corticosteroid injections \u2013 used for short term pain relief in the joint (2-3 months) and reduce the inflammatory process of the joint. One treatment soothes the symptoms for half a year to a year, and sometimes longer. After the application, the patient is advised to apply cold compresses on the wrist and to reduce physical activity in the same day. If needed, injections can be ultrasound or X-ray controlled.",

        "text":"Covid-19 Passports Were not Planned 7 Months Before the Wuhan Pandemic Broke Out The fact that the EC planned to introduce such an integrated digital system at the European level does not mean that these vaccine passports were \"Covid-19 passports\". Simply put, if Covid-19 did not appear, then these vaccine passports would contain information about other vaccines of EU citizens in electronic form. The Recommendation also welcomes the Commission's intention to examine the feasibility of developing a common vaccination card\/passport that would be compatible with electronic immunisation information systems and recognised for use across borders. Covid-19 passports that are served to us today, as the only way to open the borders, were actually planned in advance with aim to control the human population \u2013 A NECESSARY PANDEMIC! The document reads: The claim made in the post we are reviewing that the Covid-19 passports were planned in advance with the aim to control the human population and that a \"necessary pandemic\" was created is false and manipulative. Given all of the above, we evaluate the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine passports were planned 2 years before the pandemic and that the Covid-19 pandemic was \"invented\" as disinformation and manipulation. How could that be the case? Even if there were a European integrated vaccination passport system, it does not mean that it depopulates the Earth or that a pandemic is planned. A vaccine passport in 2018, in the context of documents published by the European Commission, is not the same as a Covid-19 passport in 2021. The vaccine passport planned in 2018 refers to different vaccination schedules of EU member states, i.e. vaccines that existed at that time. And this is the main problem. A Facebook post claims that Covid-19 passports were planned 7 months before the Wuhan pandemic broke out. It does not say that these are Covid-19 vaccines, but all vaccines in general. They did not even bother to remove the documents, because they know that the majority of people are in front of the TVs and few are investigating. There is no evidence that the development of a European Vaccine Information Sharing System at the EU level is a \"pandemic plan or depopulation plan\". Covid-19 is neither mentioned nor can be mentioned in this document, because the virus and the pandemic did not exist in 2018. However, the truth is quite different. This is summary information from a meeting of the eHealth Network, held on 13 November 2018. The document that is linked and quoted in the text does not mention vaccination with a passport, which is a Covid-19 passport. They know that there are idiots, who blindly believe them, and this text with documents and evidence will be declared FAKE NEWS and they will say: No, the EC DOCUMENT is not proof that the pandemic is planned, \u2013 reads the post and a link from an article published on a portal is provided. So, in the passport that was planned in 2018, a Covid-19 vaccine was not planned to be administered, because then there was no coronavirus and Covid-19 pandemic worldwide. (COVID-19 PASSPORTS PLANNED 7 MONTHS BEFORE THE WUHAN PANDEMIC BROKE OUT). Simply put, two years before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the European Commission planned to integrate vaccination information for EU citizens into an electronic system that could be used for travelling. Given all of the above, we evaluate the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine passports were planned 2 years before the pandemic and that the Covid-19 pandemic was \"invented\" as disinformation and manipulation. The two things are separate and unrelated. What was planned in 2018 by the European Commission is, in fact, a vaccine passport that is not related to Covid-19 at all, but to any vaccine, in order to electronically connect the systems with health data for the citizens more easily, in order to integrate and facilitate the flow of passengers at EU level. The document is published on the website of the European Commission and it says that the recommendation envisages the development of a European Vaccine Information Sharing System (EVIS). Even if there were a European integrated vaccination passport system, it does not mean that it depopulates the Earth or that a pandemic is planned. Another disinformation is the fact that the vaccine passports that were the idea in 2018, mean that the pandemic is planned.",

        "text":"Despite the litigation, the driver avoided the responsibility, because no one could prove that the boy really existed. Simply, I can't do anything for them. It's a basic human right. In the accident reports they were recorded like hit children. The five years old girl was rushed to the Emergency Center in Skopje immediately, but all the efforts her life to be saved were vain. It was several years ago... I can't remember, I don't know when they were born,\" she answered shortly. We asked her if she at least could remember the birthdays of her children. She didn't notice the car that was moving with a great speed on the boulevard. These children don't go to school because they don't possess documents, they can't get health insurance, social or any other care by the state. Almost, there's no family in whicjh all of the members are recorded in the birth registry. For overcoming this issue a working group formed. It's composed of representatives of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, Ministry of Home Affairs, Cabinet of the Minister without portfolio, Department of Registry, UNHCR, UNICEF, Information Center for Civil Society, Roma NGOs and experts who work on this issue, to jointly prepare recommendations to the Government to overcome this problem. (The registry is supported by Danish Association for Investigative Journalism and the SKUP project). Should this happen is yet to see. Until then, the children of Sejfula and Shekerija will not know their birthdays; people who dispossessed someone's life won't be responsible because they're not registered in the Registry. The lack of documentation by parents, the lack of finances, if the parents live in wedlock without precisely stated reason, if the mother has no proof that she was released from hospital after the birth, fear of punishment, ignorance, indifference of parents, children born at home, no proof of paternity, no place for regular residence, lack of information...,\" says Dragi Zmijanac, execituve director of the First Children's Embassy in the World Megjashi. However, after all, more than thousand Roma families in the country still live the same fate. In the project run by the First Children's Embassy in the World Megjashi, 840 children \u2013 phantoms have been identified, all of them who don't possess birth certificates. Unfortunately, that's the true,\" Rustemi says. She gave birth in hospital, but at that time neither she had documents. These children had no birth certificates, and therefore, they were not treated as existing Macedonian citizens. According to the law - only five. From the Ministry of labor and social policy they admit that the lack of birth certificates, citizenships, IDs, passports, driving licenses, education, employment, residence... a long list of human right which are not an ideal, but necessity for a decent human life, a necessary reality. A lot of reports say that Romas are facing with difficulties while getting documents. Their children are alive in reality, but neither alive or death in official statistics. According to the education laws no child at age suitable for education should be out of the education system. Later, when they want to report their children, problems with the administration start to appear. From the NGOs they say that most of the unregistered children in Macedonia are Romas. All three children of Sejfula Gjusefai have no birth certificates, they have no citizenship certificates, and therefore they have no rights as citizens of Republic of Macedonia. They have no health insurance; they're not included in the educational system, although according to the law there should be no citizen without health insurance. Five years old Roma girl crossed the street in Topansko Pole quarter in Skopje. A lot of years have passed by since their death. Government knows about the problem of the Romas' access to documents.\t\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0435 \u0443\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0434 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430.

Nearly five years later the case has no yet epilogue, and the driver was never responsible for the dispossessed life. These measures should be implemented by the end of 2012. In front of a lot of witnesses, the lifeless body of the girl lay down on the street. Shekerija Rustemi has the same fate as well. The problem to identify these children is even bigger. IN THE REALITY SEVEN, LAWFULLY FIVE Seven people live in a house in Shuto Orizari. There are cases in which this NGO managed to help some people get birth certificates. WHAT SHOULD BE DONE? Nevertheless, it's enough to walk by improvised homes in Shuto Orizari. They hardly handle with that administration labyrinth, and on the other hand they face with discrimination from the officers,\" said Ljatife Shikovska from NGO Umbrella. Among the other reasons is the lack of information about the process of getting birth documents. Having in mind that the problems related to not possessing documents for personal identification of Romas, especially in the states of former Yugoslavia, don not let them realize their basic human rights. The state authorities, civil organizations and international organizations say that immediate decisions for preventing and eradication of the lack of citizenship and protection of those persons are needed,\" says representative from the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy. She was walking to her home, tired, because she was begging whole day on one of the crossroads in Skopje. Two lives were lost, for the registry \u2013 none. Now, the children don't have health insurance, neither go to school. Children \u2013 phantomsMore than thousand Roma communities haven't registered their children in the registry of births. They are dead, but according to the birth evidence, they were never born. There's no worse discrimination than the fact that the state doesn't solve this issue for years, while NGOs, European Commission and other international organization in Macedonia warn about that, says Zmijanac. She gave births home. That's why they call them people \u2013 phantoms. Despite that, the international community faces with a number of cases of people without citizenship. I couldn't, I didn't manage to get birth certificates for my children.\t\u041d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0432, \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0430\u0432 \u0434\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043c \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430. She says he did it because of fear that if she did that in hospital it would cost her a lot. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from 1948 everyone has a right of citizenship and no one can take it away from him without a reason. Nine years old boy from Tetovo was ran over by speeding car, too. Because the girl was not register in the registry of births of the Republic of Macedonia. I wish my children could go to school, to handle with life easier, and not be like me to go to the garbage containers,\" says Gjusefai. From the NGO Umbrella they say that these problems are appearing mostly due to lack of education in Roma population. However, there's no data about the precise number of people facing with this issue. Later she managed to get documents for herself, but not for her children. Later, she wanted to report them in the registry, but she did not preserve the legal limit. It's a man \u2013 phantom. NGOs say that it's necessary an electronic system for collecting the needed data to be established as well as establishing helping services for registration in the municipalities. If the state wants to have real evidence of the citizens it should initiate law changes toward facilitating the registration and set an incentive packages for first registration of a child. When the birth pains started she called the closest friends and cousins to help her give birth. There are countless reasons for occurrence of this situation.\t\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0458. Their search for documents mostly ends there. The approach to Romas is much different compared to other citizens. When the officers notice that some document is missing, they don't refer them to the right place. No name, no birth number.",

By leveraging the absence of generally accepted international definition of national minority and manipulation of \"objective criteria\" minorities are discriminated, actually in the name of defense of national myths. This article deals with the issue of suspending the right of self-determination and denial of minorities and ethnicities in some modern states dominated by ethno-national ideology. States seek to preserve for themselves the right to decide on the identity of the man using lack of definition and insisting on objective criteria.",

The Church of St. Athanasius in Leshok Monastery, Tetovo Nonetheless, the monastery lodgings and overnight shelters are restored and available for accommodation. They are especially suitable for summer worship tourism. The last fresco-painter of the church is a painter from Galicnik, Mihail Zhurchinov; who is also the author of several icons on its iconostasis. As a matter of fact, the old church is now in ruins. It can be reached by the road leading to the village of Brezno. Eight kilometers from the city of Tetovo; on the southeastern foot of the Shar Mountain; lies the village of Leshok. Near the monastery, there is a regular bus from Tetovo and the way back. There are three layers of frescoes on the walls originating from different periods. The church is in the shape of a trikonhos; with three-sided conches on the outside and a narthex that was attached later. There are two churches in the village of Leshok that are dedicated to Saint Athanasius; one of them being older; and the other from more recent times. For these reasons; for about fifty years already; there is a hospital for lung diseases satiated nearby. Several marble columns from the iconostasis with capitols; and decorated with human and animal heads are kept in the Tetovo museum. The famous Leshok Monastery is situated in the so-called Gorno Leshok neighborhood; at an altitude of 610 meters. Furthermore, the oldest data about it is from the first half of the 14th Century; i.e. from 1326. But it is believed that it was built before the 14th Century. The Church of the Holy Mother of God; Leshok Monastery, Tetovo However, it dates from the 14th Century. The Monastery and Churches of Leshok, Tetovo, Macedonia Nevertheless, the more recent church was built in 1924. The exact time of construction of the church of the Holy Mother of God is unknown. Meanwhile, with his arrival from Mount Athos, in 1818; the monastery dormitories were restored; the monastery library was founded; and Leshok grown to be a literary and educational center. However, the oldest layer is from the time of the construction of the church; the second one is from the 17th century and the newest layer is from 1879.",

It's going to Pearl Harbor, not the States, the first sergeant said. He probably figures he doesn't have to bother anymore. The company commander and the gunnery sergeant made their appearance at the end of the company street, and one by one, the drill instructors of the four platoons of platoon leader candidates called their troops to order. Pickering asked, and when McCoy shook his head, went on, \"Or to New York?\" There was no response to the inquiry, and he put both identification cards in a typewriter and typed briefly and rapidly on them. He ended up telling her he loved her. He glanced at the sheet and then shook his head. It got worse when the people started showing up for the party: It wasn't hard to figure that if all the guests weren't as rich as Pick, they were still rich. McCoy looked at the first sergeant, who jerked his thumb in a signal for him to go with the driver. Jack Stecker hadn't said anything to her, because he always considered the boys' college money to really be Elly's money, and if she wanted to help her family out when they were in a bind, he understood that, too. When they were all finally gone and Pickering finished his telephone call, McCoy sat down beside him. The keys to his office, to his quarters, and to his personal automobile, a 1939 Packard Phaeton, as well as a Saint Christopher medal, were on a second dogtag cord worn around his neck. And then that summer, right after I graduated, he came to our church in Baltimore\u2026\tA \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0431\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u045c\u0435

A colored man with a battery on a little wheeled truck was called. He then strapped the Baby Fairbairn to his left arm, put his blouse on, and followed the others out of the storeroom. Where the hell are we? McCoy is a good one. Yes, please.\" She made him a drink, handed it to him, and then sat down on a couch and stirred the ice cubes in her glass with her index finger. Corporal Pleasant, seeing the disassembled Garand on the bunk, was forced to face the fact that there was not room for the asshole to have been in the bunk, too. Too bad Lieutenant Macklin wasn't as sharp, McCoy thought. The other two drivers McCoy took on the first ferry were PFCs, and they were on their best behavior because making the trips got them out from under the harassment of the motor pool. For that I apologize, he said. Captain Sessions was the fourth. And the last was the major McCoy was seeing for the first time. He would spend the weekend rebuilding the carburetor and changing the points and the plugs, and maybe giving it a good shine with Simoniz. Since you're so fucking nosy, we spent most of the time in her apartment. When they got there, he didn't think they were going to get in because there was a line of people waiting on the sidewalk. This meant of course reattaching the canteen, the first aid packet, and the harness to the cartridge belt; folding the raincoat and placing it in its prescribed location in the footlocker; and then relacing the leggings. Then his eyes moved to her, and they changed again. The Old Man was about twenty-four, McCoy judged, a well-set-up, ex-football player-type. Fuck you, lady. And you're not going home in disgrace. And he was in the States, not headed for the Philippines.",

And Athalia reigned over the land. 24 And looking back, he saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord: and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of them two and forty boys. 21 And Joram said: Make ready the chariot. And they made ready his chariot, and Joram king of Israel, and Ochozias king of Juda went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him in the field of Naboth the Jezrahelite. 22 And when Joram saw Jehu, he said: Is there peace, Jehu? 9 And when they were gone over, Elias said to Eliseus: Ask what thou wilt have me to do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. 23 And he went up from thence to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying: Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And Eliseus said: The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of the deliverance from Syria: and thou shalt strike the Syrians in Aphec, till thou consume them. 33 And Pharao Nechao bound him at Rebla, which is in the land of Emath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem: and he set a fine upon the land, of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. 11 And they stood having every one their weapons in their hands, from the right side of the temple, unto the left side of the altar, and of the temple, about the king. against the holy one of Israel. 3 Now there were four lepers, at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another: What mean we to stay here till we die? 8 He smote the Philistines as far as Gaza, and all their borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. Take you therefore money no more according to your order, but restore it for the repairing of the temple. 15 And Eliseus said to him: Bring a bow and arrows. 3 And he did that which was pleasing before the Lord, according to all that his father Amasias had done. And when they were come to the Jordan they cut down wood. 5 And it happened, as one was felling some timber, that the head of the axe fell into the water: and he cried out, and said: Alas, alas, alas, my lord, for this same was borrowed. 4 Now Mesa, king of Moab, nourished many sheep, and he paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with their fleeces. 5 And when Achab was dead, he broke the league which he had made with the king of Israel. 6 And king Joram went out that day from Samaria, and mustered all Israel. 15 And the rest of the acts of Sellum, and his conspiracy, which he made, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? 3 And she said to her mistress: I wish my master had been with the prophet, that is in Samaria: he would certainly have healed him of the leprosy which he hath. 4 Then Naaman went in to his lord, and told him, saying: Thus and thus said tile girl from the land of Israel. 23 And Naaman said: It is better that thou take two talents. 20 And he said: Bring me a new vessel, and put salt into it. And when they had brought it, 21 He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said: Thus saith the Lord: I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more in them death or barrenness. 14 And he said: What will she then that I do for her? 20 And his servants arose, and conspired among themselves, and slew Joas in the house of Mello in the descent of Sella. 7 And he said: Take it up. And he put out his hand and took it. 8 And the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying: In such and such a place let us lay ambushes. 8 And Helcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe: I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord: and Helcias gave the book to Saphan, and he read it. 17 And Amasias the son of Joas king of Juda lived, after the death of Joas son of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years. 7 For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and they worshipped strange gods. 12 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the diadem upon him, and the testimony: and they made him king, and anointed him: and clapping their hands. And fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 6 But they answered him: A man met us, and said to us: Go, and return to the king, that sent you, and you shall say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Is it because there was no God in Israel that thou sendest to Beelzebub the god of Accaron? Therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed, on which thou art gone up, but then shalt surely die. 7 And when the letters came to them, they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezrahel. 8 And a messenger came, and told him, saying: They have brought the heads of the king's sons. 1 And Eliseus spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying: Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst find: for the Lord hath exiled a famine, and it shall come upon the land seven years. Chapter 18 1 In the third year of Osee the son of Ela king of Israel, reigned m Ezechias the son of Achaz king of Juda. 25 And when they began to dwell there, they feared not the Lord: and the Lord sent lions among them, which killed them. 22 And he said: Well: my master hath sent me to thee, saying: Just now there are come to me from mount Ephraim, two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. so is Pharao king of Egypt, to all that trust in him. 14 And when he was departed from Eliseus, he came to his master, who said to him: What saith Eliseus to thee? And he answered: He told me: Thou shalt recover. 15 And on the next day he took a blanket, and pouted water on it, and spread it upon his face: and he died, and Hazael reigned in his stead. 19 And Eliseus said to them: This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will shew you the man whom you seek. So he led them into Samaria. 14 And Manahem the son of Gadi went up from Thersa: and he came into Samaria, and struck Sellum the son of Jabes in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 18 But to the king of Juda, who sent you to consult the Lord, thus shall you say: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Forasmuch as thou hast heard the words of the book, 19 And thy heart hath been moved to fear, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord, hearing the words against this place, and the inhabitants thereof, to wit, that they should become a wonder and a curse: and thou hast rent thy garments, and wept before me, I also have heard thee, saith the Lord: 20 Therefore I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy sepulchre in peace, that thy eyes may not see all the evils which I will bring; upon this place. go behind and follow me. 38 And Eliseus returned to Galgal, and there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets dwelt before him. 24 And he did that which was evil before the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin. 13 And he took up the mantle of Elias, that fell from him: and going back, he stood upon the bank of the Jordan, 14 And he struck the waters with the mantle of Elias, that had fallen from him, and they were not divided. And he said: Where is now the God of Elias? 29 Thus saith the king: Let not Ezechias deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of my hand. 5 Therefore the overseers of the house, and the rulers of the city, and the ancients, and the tutors sent to Jehu, saying: We are thy servants, whatsoever thou shalt command us we will do, neither will we make us a king: do thou all that pleaseth thee. 7 And she came, and told the man of God. And he said: Go, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor: and thou and thy sons live of the rest. mark, and see how he seeketh occasions against me. 8 And when Eliseus the man of God had heard this, to wit, that the king of Israel had rent his garments, he sent to him, saying: Why hast thou rent thy garments? And calling together his servants, he said: Why do you not tell me who it is that betrays me to the king of Israel? 13 But Joas king of Israel took Amasias, king of Juda the son of Joas, the son of Ochozias, in Bethsames, and brought him into Jerusalem: and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits. 2 Now there had gone out robbers from Syria, and had led away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid, and she waited upon Naaman's wife. 24 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amen: and made Josias his son their king in his stead. 25 But the rest of the acts of Amen which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And the king said to her: What aileth thee? And she answered: 28 This woman said to me: Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow. 25 And it came to pass, when the burnt offering was ended, that Jehu commanded his soldiers and captains, saying: Go in, and kill them, let none escape. 37 And as he was worshipping in the temple of Nesroch his god, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons slew him with the sword, and they fled into the land of the Armenians, and Asarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. 17 And the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan and Rabsaris, and Rabsaces from Lachis to king Ezechias with a strong army to Jerusalem: and they went up and came to Jerusalem, and they stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the way of the fuller's field. 3 And she said to her mistress: I wish my master had been with the prophet, that is in Samaria: he would certainly have healed him of the leprosy which he hath. And when it had touched the bones of Eliseus, the man came to life, and stood upon his feet. 15 And the sons of the prophets at Jericho, who were over against him, seeing it said: The spirit of Elias hath rested upon Eliseus. 27 And the Lord said: I will remove Juda also from before my face, as I have removed Israel: and I will cast off this city Jerusalem, which I chose, and the house, of which I said: My name shall be there. 31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord the God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel to sin. 22 And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Eliseus, which he spoke. 7 And when the letters came to them, they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezrahel. 14 They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the camp of the Syrians, saying: Go, and see. 30 But the mother of the child said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and tell changes of raiment, 6 And brought the letter to the king of Israel, in these words: When thou shalt receive this letter, know that I have sent to thee Naaman my servant, that thou mayest heal him of his leprosy. And when he had taken them, he said to him: Strike with an arrow upon the ground. And he struck three times and stood still. 19 And the man of God was angry with him, and said: If thou hadst smitten five or six or seven times, thou hadst smitten Syria even to utter destruction: but now three times shalt thou smite it. 20 And Eliseus died, and they buried him. And when he had put his hand, Eliseus put his hands over the king's hands, 17 And said: Open the window to the east. And he said: It is Elias the Thesbite. 14 And he took all the gold, and silver, and all the vessels, that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures, and hostages, and returned to Samaria. 37 And he did evil before the Lord according to all that his fathers had done. 30 And he appointed him a continual allowance, which was also given him by the king day by day, all the days of his life. 20 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, she set him on her knees until noon, and then he died. And the king appointed her an eunuch, saying: Restore her all that is hers, and all the revenues of the lands, from the day that she left the land, to this present. And they took them alive, and killed them at the pit by the cabin, two and forty men, and he left not any of them. And when he had brought him a bow, and arrows, 16 He said to the king of Israel: Put thy hand upon the bow. 1 In his days Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up, and Joakim became his servant three years: then again he rebelled against him. 18 And he said: Let him alone, let no man move his bones. So his bones were left untouched with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. And when he had opened it, Eliseus said: Shoot an arrow. And he shot. 9 And Isaias said to him: This shall be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do the word which he hath spoken: Wilt thou that the shadow go forward ten lines, or that it go back so many degrees? 12 And he arose, and went to Samaria: and when he was come to the shepherds' cabin in the way, 13 He met with the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and he said to them: Who are you? And they answered: We are the brethren of Ochozias, and are come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen. 13 And Athalia heard the noise of the people running: and going in to the people into the temple of the Lord, 14 She saw the king standing upon a tribunal, as the manner was, and the singers, and the trumpets near him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding the trumpets: and she rent her garments, and cried: A conspiracy, a conspiracy. 14 Then he went down, and washed in the Jordan seven times: according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child, and he was made clean. 21 And he walked in all the way in which his father had walked: and he served the abominations which his father had served, and he adored them; 22 And forsook the Lord the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord. 16 But the money for trespass, and the money for sine, they brought not into the temple of the Lord, because it was for the priests. 36 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for they had received commandment from the king that they should not answer him. 29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers the kings of Israel, and Zacharias his son reigned in his stead. 44 So he fief it before them: and they ate, and there was left according to the word of the Lord. 2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the ways of David his father: he turned not aside to the right hand, or to the left. 16 But the money for trespass, and the money for sine, they brought not into the temple of the Lord, because it was for the priests. And he said to them: Why are you come back? 17 The watchmen therefore, that stood upon the tower of Jezrahel, saw the troop of Jehu coming, and said: I see a troop. 12 And he arose, and went to Samaria: and when he was come to the shepherds' cabin in the way, 13 He met with the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and he said to them: Who are you? And they answered: We are the brethren of Ochozias, and are come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen. 11 And he stood with him, and was troubled so far as to blush: and the man of God wept. 2 And he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying: 3 I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is pleasing before thee. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces. 17 Behold the days shall come, that all that is in thy house, and that thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord. 21 And he commanded all the people, saying: Keep the phase to the Lord your God, according as it is written in the book of this covenant. 10 And Ezechias said: It is an easy matter for the shadow to go forward ten lines: and I do not desire that this be done, but let it return back ten degrees. 16 At that time Ezechias broke the doors of the temple of the Lord, and the plates of gold which he had fastened on them, and gave them to the king of the Assyrians. 22 Now there was no such a phase kept from the days of the judges, who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda, 23 As was this phase that was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem, in the eighteenth year of king Josias. 1 Josias was eight years old when he began to reign: he reigned one and thirty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Idida, the daughter of Hadaia, of Besecath. 17 And Joiada made a covenant between the Lord, and the king, and the people, that they should be the people of the Lord, and between the king and the people. 28 And he did that which was evil before the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin. 14 But the altar of brass that was before the Lord, he removed from the face of the temple, and from the place of the altar, and from the place of the temple of the Lord: and he set it at the side of the altar toward the north. 21 And he walked in all the way in which his father had walked: and he served the abominations which his father had served, and he adored them; 22 And forsook the Lord the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord. 7 But let two parts of you, all that go forth on the sabbath, keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king. 8 And you shall compass him round about, having weapons in your hands: and if any man shall enter the precinct of the temple, let him be slain: and you shall be with the king coming in and going out. 9 And the centurions did according to all things that Joiada the priest had commanded them: and taking every one their men, that went in on the sabbath, with them that went out on the sabbath, came to Joiada the priest. 19 And he said to him: Go in peace. So he departed from him in the springtime of the earth. 5 And when he had possession of the kingdom, he put his servants to death that had slain the king his father: 6 But the children of the murderers he did not put to death, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the Lord commanded, saying: The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: but every man shall die for his own sins. 13 And offered libations and poured the blood of the peace offerings, which he had offered upon the altar. 8 And Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachis. But he said to his servant: Take him, and carry him to his mother. 12 This was the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Jehu, saying: Thy children to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel. And he went out from him a leper as white as snow. Chapter 6 1 And the sons of the prophets said to Eliseus: Behold the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. 2 Let us go as far as the Jordan and take out of the wood every man a piece of timber, that we may build us there a place to dwell in. 14 Therefore he sent thither horses and chariots, and the strength of an army: and they came by night, and beset the city. 33 And Pharao Nechao bound him at Rebla, which is in the land of Emath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem: and he set a fine upon the land, of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. 22 And he said: Thou shalt not kill them: for thou didst not take them with thy sword, or thy bow, that thou mayst kill them: but set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master. 21 And the king of Israel said to Eliseus, when he saw them: My father, shall I kill them? 40 And they poured it out for their companions to eat: and when they had tasted of the pottage, they cried out, saying: Death is in the pot, O man of God. 2 And he did evil before the Lord, but not like his father and his mother: for he took away the statues of Baal, which his father had made. 19 Ezechias said to Isaias: The word of the Lord, which thou hast spoken, is good: let peace and truth be in my days. 11 And he took away the horses which the kings of Juda had given to the sun, at the entering in of the temple of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathanmelech the eunuch, who was in Pharurim: and he burnt the chariots of the sun with fire. 25 But he went in, and stood before his master. 20 And when they were come into Samaria, Eliseus said: Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw themselves to be in the midst of Samaria. 13 Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Ana and of Ava? So now take him, and cast him into the field, according to the word of the Lord. 14 Now Eliseus was sick of the illness whereof he died: and Joas king of Israel went down to him, and wept before him, and said: O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the guider thereof. 25 So she went forward, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel: and when the mall of God saw her coming towards, he said to Giezi his servant: Behold that Sunamitess. 26 Go therefore to meet her, and say to her: Is all well with thee, and with thy husband, and with thy son? 13 And the Lord testified to them in Israel and in Juda by the hand of all the prophets and seers, saying: Return from your wicked ways, and keep my precepts, and ceremonies, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers: and as I have sent to you in the hand of my servants the prophets. 24 And Hazael king of Syria died, and Benadad his son reigned in his stead. 11 Then Jehu went forth to the servants of his lord: and they said to him: Are all things well? 1 And Eliseus said: Hear ye the word of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord: To morrow about this time a bushel of fine hour shall be sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, in the gate of Samaria. 12 And Josaphat said: The word of the Lord is with him. 2 Achaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: he did not that which was pleasing in the sight of the Lord his Cod, as David his father. 3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel: moreover he consecrated also his son, making him pass through the fire according to the idols of the nations: which the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel. 4 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills, and under every green tree. 20 And he said: Bring me a new vessel, and put salt into it. 23 And Jehu and Jonadab the son of Rechab went to the temple of Baal, and said to the worshippers of Baal: Search, and see that there be not any with you of the servants of the Lord, but that there be the servants of Baal only. 4 And Joas said to the priests: O All the money of the sanctified things, which is brought into the temple of the Lord by those that pass, which is offered for the price of a soul, and which of their own accord, and of their own free heart they bring into the temple of the Lord: 5 Let the priests take it according to their order, and repair the house, wheresoever they shall see any thing that wanteth repairing. why came this mad man to thee? And he said to them: You know the man, and what he said. 12 But they answered: It is false, but rather do thou tell us. 6 But yet they departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin, but walked in them: and there still remained a grove also in Samaria. 7 And Joachaz had no more left of the people than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen: for the king of Syria had slain them, and had brought them low as dust by thrashing in the barnfloor. 7 He slew of Edom h in the valley of the Saltpits ten thousand men, and took the rock by war, and called the name thereof Jectehel, unto this day. 21 And Ezechias slept with his fathers, and Manasses his son reigned in his stead. 15 And he said: What did they see in thy house? Ezechias said: They saw all the things that are in my house: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewn them. 22 But over the people that remained in the land of Juda, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had left, he gave the government to Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan. 11 So Jehu slew all that were left of the house of Achab in Jezrahel, and all his chief men, and his friends, and his priests, till there were no remains left of him. 33 And going in he shut the door upon him, and upon the child, and prayed to the Lord. 32 But Eliseus sat in his house, and the ancients sat with him. 27 And the Lord did not say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joas. 28 But the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his velour, where- with he fought, and how he restored Damascus, and Emath to Juda in Israel, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? And the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, and the king of Edom went down to him. 23 And Joram turned his hand, and fleeing, said to Ochozias: There is treachery, Ochozias. And Jehu said: Unto whom of us all? And he said: To thee, O prince. 6 And he arose, and went into the chamber: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: I have anointed thee king over Israel, the people of the Lord. So he sent a man before: and before that messenger came, he said to the ancients: Do you know that this son of a murderer hath sent to cut off my head? Look then, when the messenger shall come, shut the door, and suffer him not to come in: for behold the sound of his master's feet is behind him. 33 While he was yet speaking to them, the messenger appeared who was coming to him. 24 And how can you stand against one lord of the least of my master's servants? And he struck the waters, and they were divided, hither and thither, and Eliseus passed over. 7 He slew of Edom h in the valley of the Saltpits ten thousand men, and took the rock by war, and called the name thereof Jectehel, unto this day. 8 Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas son of Joachaz, son of Jehu king of Israel, saying: Come let us see one another. 29 In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Achab, Ochozias reigned over Juda, 30 And Jehu came into Jezrahel. 13 Sellum the son of Jabes began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Azarias king of Juda: and reigned one month in Samaria. And fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. So Joas king of Israel went up, and he and Amasias king of Juda saw one another in Bethsames a town in Juda. 12 And Juda was put to the worst before Israel, and they fled every man to their dwellings. 41 So these nations feared the Lord, but nevertheless served also their idols: their children also and grandchildren, as their fathers did, so do they unto this day. 2 And the city was shut up and besieged till the eleventh year of king Sedecias, 3 The ninth day of the month: and a famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land. 10 And when they saw that there was very much money in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and poured it out, and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord: 11 And they gave it out by number and measure into the hands of them that were over the builders of the house of the Lord: and they laid it out to the carpenters, and the masons that wrought in the house of the Lord, 12 And made the repairs: and to them that cut stones, and to buy timber, and stones, to be hewed, that the repairs of the house of the Lord might be completely finished, and wheresoever there was need of expenses to uphold the house 13 But there were not made of the same money for the temple of the Lord, bowls, or fleshhooks, or censers, or trumpets, or any vessel of gold and silver, of the money that was brought into the temple of the Lord. If it be, said he, give me thy hand. He gave him his hand. 16 And Joas slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel: and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. 6 Now till the three and twentieth year of king Joas, the priests did not make the repairs of the temple. 7 And king Joas called Joiada the high priest and the priests, saying to them: Why do you not repair the temple? 19 And Eliseus said to them: This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will shew you the man whom you seek. II Kings 5 Naaman, general of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable: for by him the Lord gave deliverance to Syria: and he was a valiant man and rich, but a leper. 8 And Ezechias had said to Isaias: What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up to the temple of the Lord the third day? 24 But Jehu bent Iris bow with his hand, and shot Joram between the shoulders: and the arrow went out through his heart, and immediately he fell in his chariot. let him come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel. And when he had brought him a bow, and arrows, 16 He said to the king of Israel: Put thy hand upon the bow. 5 And he destroyed the soothsayers, whom the kings of Juda had appointed to sacrifice in the high places in the cities of Juda, and round about Jerusalem: them also that burnt incense to Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to the twelve signs, and to all the host of heaven. 2 And Eliseus said to her: What wilt thou have me to do for thee? 13 And one of his servants answered: Let us take the five horses that are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole multitude of Israel, for the rest are consumed,) and let us send and see. 4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said: Behold two kings could not stand before him, and how shall we be able to resist? why came this mad man to thee? And he said to them: You know the man, and what he said. 27 And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying: Carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from thence captive, and let him go, and dwell with them: and let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land. 15 But the rest of the acts of Joas, which he did, and his valour, wherewith he fought against Amasias king of Juda, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? 13 And Eliseus said to the king of Israel: What have I to do with thee? And when he was come, he fell upon his knees, before Elias, and besought him and said: Man of God, despise not my life, and the lives of thy servants that are with me. 14 Behold fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two first captains of fifty men, and the fifties that were with them: but now I beseech thee to spare my life. 22 And he said to them that were over the wardrobe: Bring forth garments for all the servants of Baal. But Jezabel hearing of his coming in, painted her face with stibic stone, and adorned her head, and looked out of a window 31 At Jehu coming in at the gate, and said: Can there be peace for Zambri, that hath killed his master? So now thou hast received money, and received garments, to buy oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants. 27 But the leprosy of Naaman shall also stick to thee, and to thy seed for ever. 26 But he said: Was not my heart present, when the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee? 10 And Elias answering, said to the captain of fifty: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee, and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him, and the fifty that were with him. 17 And Joiada made a covenant between the Lord, and the king, and the people, that they should be the people of the Lord, and between the king and the people. 16 And Isaias said to Ezechias: Hear the word of the Lord. 6 And Elias said to him: Stay here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as the Jordan. 11 And Urias the priest built an altar according to all that king Achaz had commanded from Damascus, so did Urias the priest, until king Achaz came from Damascus. or from whence came they to thee? 5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all the warriors that were with him were scattered, and left him: 6 So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha, and he gave judgment upon him. 4 And before Isaias was gone out of the middle of the court, the word of the Lord came to him, saying: 5 Go back, and tell Ezechias the captain of my people: Thus saith the Lord the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, and I have seen thy tears: and behold I have healed thee; on the third day thou shalt go up to the temple of the Lord. 19 And Rabsaces said to them: Speak to Ezechias: Thus saith the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this confidence, wherein thou trustest? 5 He trusted in the Lord the God of Israel: so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Juda, nor any of them that were before him: 6 And he stuck to the Lord, and departed not from his steps, but kept his commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses. 10 And king Achaz went to Damascus to meet Theglathphalasar king of the Assyrians, end when he had seen the altar of Damascus, king Achaz sent to Urias the priest a pattern of it, and its likeness according to all the work thereof. 5 And when he was telling the king how he had raised one dead to life, the woman appeared, whose son he had restored to life, crying to the king for her house, and her lands. 26 And it was told the king of the Assyrians, and it was said: The nations which thou hast removed, and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria, know not the ordinances of the God of the land: and the Lord hath sent lions among them: and behold they kill them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominions that Ezechias shewed them not. 17 And Amasias the son of Joas king of Juda lived, after the death of Joas son of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years. 22 And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Eliseus, which he spoke. 15 And she said to them: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me: 16 Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will bring evils upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the words of the law which the king of Juda hath read: 17 Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, provoking me by all the works of their hands: therefore my indignation shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched. 32 And Jehu lifted up his face to the window, and said: Who is this? And two or three eunuchs bowed down to him. 8 So when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank: and they took from thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it: and they came again, and went into another tent, and carried from thence in like manner, and hid it. 9 Then they said one to another: We do not well: for this is a day of good tidings. If we hold our peace, and do not tell it till the morning, we shall be charged with a crime: come, let us go and tell it in the king's court. And he forced him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants, and they carried them before him. 20 In his days Edom revolted, from being under Juda, and made themselves a king. 19 And he said to him: Go in peace. 15 But Joiada commended the centurions that were over the army, and said to them: Have her forth without the precinct of the temple, and whosoever shall follow her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest had said: Let her not be slain in the temple of the Lord. Chapter 20 1 In those days Ezechias was sick unto death: and Isaias the son of Amos the prophet came and said to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Give charge concerning thy house, for thou shalt die, and not live. 6 And he arose, and went into the chamber: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: I have anointed thee king over Israel, the people of the Lord. 19 And the men of the city said to Eliseus: Behold the situation of this city is very good, as thou, my lord, seest: but the waters are very bad, and the ground barren. And Giezi said: My lord O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Eliseus raised to life. 9 And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying: Beware that thou pass not to such a place: for the Syrians are there in ambush. And he said: Behold, so great an evil is from the Lord: what shall I look for more from the Lord? 19 Moreover all the temples of the high places, which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord, Josias took away: and he did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. 7 Wherefore the Lord also was with him, and in all things, to which he went forth, he behaved himself wisely. 9 And Joachaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joas his son reigned in his stead. 32 Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a trench about it. 33 By the way that he came, he shall return: and into this city he shall not come, saith the Lord. 20 And so it fell out to him as it was foretold, and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died. And they struck him in the going up to Gaver, which is by Jeblaam: and he fled into Mageddo, and died there. 15 And the servant of the man of God rising early, went out, and saw an army round about the city, and horses and chariots: and he told him, saying: Alas, alas, alas, my lord, what shall we do? 42 And a certain man came from Baalsalisa bringing to the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty leaves of barley, and new corn in his scrip. And on a certain day, when he went out to his father to the reapers, 19 He said to his father: My head acheth, my head acheth. 23 And he said to her: Why dost thou go to him? 15 And Eliseus said to him: Bring a bow and arrows. 24 I have cut down, and I have drunk strange waters, and have dried up with the soles of my feet all the shut up waters. 25 And from thence he went to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria. 7 And Isaias said: Bring me a lump of figs. 21 Now Joas was seven years old, when he began to reign. 26 And all the people both little and great, and the captains of the soldiers, rising up went to Egypt, fearing the Chaldees. 13 The high places also that were at Jerusalem on the right side of the Mount of Offence, O which Solomon king of Israel had built to Astaroth the idol of the Sidonians, and to Chamos the scandal of Moab, and to Melchom the abomination of the children of Ammon, the king defiled. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces. 17 And king Achaz took away the graven bases, and the laver that was upon them: and he took down the sea from the brazen oxen that held it up, and put it upon a pavement of stone. 22 Now Hazael king of Syria afflicted Israel all the days of Joachaz: 23 And the Lord had mercy on them, and returned to them because of his covenant, which he had made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob: and he would not destroy them, nor utterly cast them away, unto this present time. And she being called, went in to him: and he said: Take up thy son. 14 And when he was departed from Eliseus, he came to his master, who said to him: What saith Eliseus to thee? And he answered: He told me: Thou shalt recover. 15 And on the next day he took a blanket, and pouted water on it, and spread it upon his face: and he died, and Hazael reigned in his stead. have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 13 Again he sent a third captain of fifty men, and the fifty that were with him. 4 Now Mesa, king of Moab, nourished many sheep, and he paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with their fleeces. And when they had brought it, 21 He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said: Thus saith the Lord: I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more in them death or barrenness. He arose, therefore, and followed her. 20 And they brought him away upon horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 15 And returning to the man of God with all his train, be came, and stood before him, and said: In truth, I know there is no other God in all the earth, but only in Israel: I beseech thee therefore take a blessing of thy servant. And Joakim slept with his fathers: 6 And Joachin his son reigned in his stead. 8 But they said: A hairy man with a girdle of leather about his loins. And let a third part be at the gate of Sur: and let a third part be at the gate behind the dwelling of the shieldbearers: and you shall keep the watch of the house of Messa. 20 And he said: Proclaim a festival for Baal. 30 And the Lord said to Jehu: Because thou hast diligently executed that which was right and pleasing in my eyes, and hast done to the house of Achab according to all that was in my heart: thy children shall sit upon the throne of Israel to the fourth Generation. 9 In the fourth year of king Ezechias, which was the seventh year of Osee the son of Ela king of Israel, Salmanasar king of the Assyrians came up to Samaria, and besieged it, 10 And took it. 35 Who are they among all the gods of the nations, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord may deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? And Ochozias the son of Joram king of Juda, went down to visit Joram the son of Achab in Jezrahel, because he was sick there. 15 And Ezechias gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures. 35 Then he returned and walked in the house, once to and fro: and he went up, and lay upon him: and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes. 36 And he called Giezi, and said to him: Call this Sunamitess. 10 And Elias answering, said to the captain of fifty: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee, and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him, and the fifty that were with him. 37 She came and fell at his feet, and worshipped upon the ground: and took up her son, and went out. 14 And he broke in pieces the statues, and cut down the groves: and he filled their places with the bones of dead men. 13 And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming, and he showed them the house of his aromatical spices, and the gold and the silver, and divers precious odours, and ointments, and the house of his vessels, and all that he had in his treasures. 22 But if you say to me: We trust in the Lord our God: is it not he, whose high places and altars Ezechias hath taken away: and hath commanded Juda and Jerusalem: You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? 13 Then they made haste and taking every man his garment laid it under his feet, after the manner of a judgment seat, and they sounded the trumpet, and said: Jehu is king. 14 So Jehu the son of Josaphat the son of Namsi conspired against Joram. 18 And Manasses slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Oza: and Amen his son reigned in his stead. And he reigned twelve years. 5 And when Achab was dead, he broke the league which he had made with the king of Israel. 2 And Ochozias fell through the lattices of his upper chamber which he had in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, saying to them: Go, consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my illness. 3 And an angel of the Lord spoke to Elias the Thesbite, saying: Arise, and go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them: Is there not a God in Israel, that ye go to consult Beelzebub the god of Accaron? 4 If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine: and if we will remain here, we must also die: come, therefore, and let us run over to the camp of the Syrians. 11 But Amasias did not rest satisfied. So Joas king of Israel went up, and he and Amasias king of Juda saw one another in Bethsames a town in Juda. 12 And Juda was put to the worst before Israel, and they fled every man to their dwellings. 4 Then Naaman went in to his lord, and told him, saying: Thus and thus said tile girl from the land of Israel. And I said to her on the next day: Give thy son that we may eat him. And she hath hid her son. 11 And Isaias the prophet called upon the Lord, and he brought the shadow ten degrees backwards by the lines, by which it had already gone down in the dial of Achaz. 17 And the woman conceived, and brought forth a son in the time, and at the same hour, that Eliseus had said. 21 And Joram said: Make ready the chariot. And they made ready his chariot, and Joram king of Israel, and Ochozias king of Juda went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him in the field of Naboth the Jezrahelite. 22 And when Joram saw Jehu, he said: Is there peace, Jehu? 14 And they hearkened not, but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers, who would not obey the Lord their God. 21 And all the Moabites hearing that the kings were come up to fight against them, gathered together all that were girded with a belt upon them, and stood in the borders. The Lord said to me: Go up to this land and destroy it. 26 Then Eliacim the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces: We pray thee speak to us thy servants in Syriac: for we understand that tongue: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the hearing of the people that are upon the wall. 23 In the fiftieth year of Azarias king of Juda reigned Phaceia the son of Manahem over Israel in Samaria two years. where is the god of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava? 32 In the second year of Phacee the son of Romelia king of Israel reigned Joatham son of Ozias king of Juda. 16 Then Manahem destroyed Thapsa and all that were in it and the borders thereof from Thersa, because they would not open to him: and he slew all the women thereof that were with child, and ripped them up. 17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azarias king of Juda, reigned Manahem son of Gadi over Israel ten years in Samaria. 18 And he did that which was evil before the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin all his days. 17 One pillar was eighteen cubits high, and the chapiter of brass which was upon it was three cubits high: and the network, and the pomegranates that were upon the chapiter of the pillar, were all of brass: and the second pillar had the like adorning. If they spare us, we shall live: but if they kill us, we shall but die. II Kings 15 In the seven and twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Azarias son of Amasias, king of Juda. 2 He was sixteen years old, when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Jechelia of Jerusalem. 8 And they walked according to the way of the nations which the Lord had destroyed in the sight of the children of Israel and of the kings of Israel: because they had done in like manner. 18 And they have cast their gods into the fire: for they were not Rods, but the works of men's hands of wood and stone, and they destroyed them. 7 And she came, and told the man of God. Chapter 16 1 In the seventeenth year of Phacee the son of Romelia reigned Achaz the son of Joatham king of Juda. 22 And he said to them that were over the wardrobe: Bring forth garments for all the servants of Baal. And they brought them forth garments. 18 And Manasses slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Oza: and Amen his son reigned in his stead. 3 And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael the king of Syria, and into the hand of Benadad the son of Hazael all days. 36 And coming back they told him. II Kings 2 And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elias into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elias and Eliseus were going from Galgal. 11 And Nabuzardan the commander of the army, carried away the rest of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the common people. 25 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismael the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the seed royal came, and ten men with him: and smote Godolias so that he died: and also the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him in Maspha. 28 But the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his velour, where- with he fought, and how he restored Damascus, and Emath to Juda in Israel, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? For after three years, in the sixth year of Ezechias, that is, in the ninth year of Osee king of Israel, Samaria was taken: 11 And the king of the Assyrians carried away Israel into Assyria, and placed them in Hale, and in Habor by the rivers of Gozan in the cities of the Medes: 12 Because they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his covenant: all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, they would not hear nor do. 13 In the fourteenth year of king Ezechias, Sennacherib king of the Assyrians came up against the fenced cities of Juda: and took them. 18 And the child grew. 17 So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elias spoke, and Joram his brother reigned in his stead, in the second year of Joram the son of Josaphat king of Juda: because he had no son. And Elias went away. And do that which I bid thee. And when he had called her, and she stood before him, 13 He said to his servant: Say to her Behold thou hast diligently served us in all things, what wilt thou have me to de for thee? hast thou any business, and wilt thou that I speak to the king, or to the general of the army? 6 And the man of God said: Where did it fall? And Jehu said: It is the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servant Elias the Thesbite, saying: In the field of Jezrahel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezabel, 37 And the flesh of Jezabel shall be as dung upon the face of the earth in the field of Jezrahel, so that they who pass by shall say: Is this that same Jezabel? Chapter 10 19 But the Lord would not destroy Juda, for David his servant's sake, as he had promised him, to give him a light, and to his children always. 6 And he wrote letters the second time to them, saying: If you be mine, and will obey me, take the heads of the sons of your master, and come to me to Jezrahel by to morrow this time. And I have entered into the furthest parts thereof, and the forest of its Carmel. 12 And the altars that were upon the top of the upper chamber of Achaz, which the kings of Juda had made, and the altars which Manasses had made in the two courts of the temple of the Lord, the king broke down: and he ran from thence, and cast the ashes of them into the torrent Cedron. 25 Now Joas d the son of Joachaz, took the cities out of the hand of Benadad, the son of Hazael, which he had taken out of the hand of Joachaz his father by war, three times did Joas beat him, and he restored the cities to Israel. 4 And a breach was made into the city: and all the men of war fled in the night between the two walls by the king's garden, (now the Chaldees besieged the city round about,) and Sedecias fled by the way that leadeth to the plains of the wilderness. 17 And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned, to stand at the gate: and the people trod upon him in the entrance of the gate; and he died, as the man of God had said, when the king came down to him. 18 And the general of the army took Seraias the chief priest, and Sophonias the second priest, and three doorkeepers. She answered: I will go. 10 At that time the servants of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was surrounded with their forts. 12 But of the poor of the land he left some dressers of vines and husbandmen. 13 And the pillars of brass that were in the temple of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass which was in the house of the Lord, the Chaldees broke in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. 14 They took away also the pots of brass, and the mazers, and the forks, and the cups, and the mortars, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered. 18 Wherefore Joas king of Juda took all the sanctified things, which Josaphat, and Joram, and Ochozias his fathers the kings of Juda had dedicated to holy uses, and which he himself had offered: and all the silver that could be found in the treasures of the temple of the Lord, and in the king's palace: and sent it to Hazael king of Syria, and he went off from Jerusalem. 23 And a great provision of meats was set before them, and they ate and drank, and he let them go, and they went away to their master, and the robbers of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. 24 And tit came to pass after these things, that Benadad king of Syria gathered together all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 10 And Sellum the son of Jabes conspired against him: and struck him publicly and killed him, and reigned in his place. 11 Now the rest of the acts of Zacharias, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? 12 This was the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Jehu, saying: Thy children to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel. 20 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: but Athalia was slain with the sword in the king's house. 27 And the Lord did not say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joas. And coming to meet him, they worshipped him, falling to the ground, 16 And they said to him: Behold, there are with thy servants fifty strong men, that can go, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. 12 And he commanded Helcias the priest, and Ahicam the son of Saphan, and Achobor the son of Micha, and Saphan the scribe, and Asaia the king's servant, saying: 13 Go and consult the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Juda, concerning the words of this book which is found: for the great wrath of the Lord is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do all that is written for us. 14 So Helcias the priest, and Ahicam, and Achobor, and Saphan, and Asaia went to Holda the prophetess the wife of Sellum the son of Thecua, the son of Araas keeper of the wardrobe, who dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second: and they spoke to her. 32 And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. 6 And in the ninth year of Osee, the king of the Assyrians took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria: and he placed them in Hala and Habor by the river of Gozan, in the cities of the Medes. So he made him ride in his chariot, 17 And brought him into Samaria. 20 These Nabuzardan the general of the army took away, and carried them to the king of Babylon to Reblatha. 38 And Eliseus returned to Galgal, and there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets dwelt before him. 17 And he said: What is that monument which I see? And the men of that city answered: It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Juda, and foretold these things which thou hast done upon the altar of Bethel. 4 If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine: and if we will remain here, we must also die: come, therefore, and let us run over to the camp of the Syrians. II Kings 5 Naaman, general of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable: for by him the Lord gave deliverance to Syria: and he was a valiant man and rich, but a leper. 20 And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifices used to be offered, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. did I not say to thee: Do not deceive me? 29 Then he said to Giezi: Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go. If any man meet thee, salute him not: and if any man salute thee, answer him not: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. 8 And the king said to Hazael: Take with thee presents, and go to meet the man of God, and consult the Lord by him, saying: Can I recover of this my illness? 25 Is it without the will of the Lord that I am come up to this place to destroy it? 18 And it came to pass according to the word of the man of God, which he spoke to the king, when he said: Two bushels of barley shall be for a stater, and a bushel of fine flour for a stater, at this very time to morrow in the gate of Samaria. 19 When that lord answered the mall of' God, and said: Although the Lord should make flood-gates in heaven, could this come to pass which thou sayest? 17 Then Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Geth, and took it and set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 10 Let us therefore make him a little chamber, and put a little bed in it for him, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, that when he cometh to us, he may abide there. And Giezi said: Do not ask, for she hath no son, and her husband is old. 27 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Joachin king of Juda, in the twelfth month the seven and twentieth day of the month: Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Joachin king of Juda out of prison. 28 And he spoke kindly to him: and he set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon. 29 And he changed his garments which he had in prison, and he ate bread always before him, all the days of his life. 1 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, he and all his army against Jerusalem: and they surrounded it: end raised works round about it. And Eliseus said to him: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. 4 And the king commanded Helcias the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to cast out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burnt them without Jerusalem in the valley of Cedron, and he carried the ashes of them to Bethel. 3 And the king stood upon the step: and made a covenant with the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies and his ceremonies, with all their heart, and with all their soul, and to perform the words of this covenant, which were written in that book: and the people agreed to the covenant. And there was now no bitterness in the pot. So he sent a man before: and before that messenger came, he said to the ancients: Do you know that this son of a murderer hath sent to cut off my head? And he sent: and all the ancients of Juda and Jerusalem were assembled to him. 18 And all the people of the land went into the temple of Baal, and broke down his altars, and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly: they slew also Mathan the priest of Baal before the altar. 11 And he did that which is evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from all the sine of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, but he walked in them. 33 And he said to them: Throw her down headlong: and they threw her down, and the wall was sprinkled with her blood, and the hoofs of the horses trod upon her. 10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God had told him, and prevented him, and looked well to himself there not once nor twice. 36 And he called Giezi, and said to him: Call this Sunamitess. And he rebelled against the king of the Assyrians, and served him not. Now Joram had besieged Ramoth Galaad, he and all Israel fighting with Hazael king of Syria: 15 And was returned to be healed in Jezrahel of his wounds, for the Syrians had wounded him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And the Lord struck them with blindness, according to the word of Eliseus. 20 And they brought him away upon horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 1 Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Haphsiba. 15 And they reckoned not with the men that received the money to distribute it to the workmen, but they bestowed it faithfully. 2 And Elias said to Eliseus: Stay thou here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as Bethel. 13 And Joas slept with his fathers: and Jeroboam sat upon his throne. 27 And Rabsaces answered them, saying: Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee, to speak these words, and not rather to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their urine with you? 14 And Isaias the prophet came to king Ezechias, and said to him: What said these men? And when Saphan had read it before the king, 11 And the king had heard the words of the law of the Lord, he rent his garments. 12 And Hazael said to him: Why doth my lord weep? 5 So they arose in the evening, to go to the Syrian camp, And when they were come to the first part of the camp of the Syrians, they found no man there. 11 Behold thou hast heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done to all countries, how they have laid them waste: and canst thou alone be delivered? 12 Have the gods of the nations delivered any of them, whom my fathers have destroyed, to wit, Gozan, and Haran, and Reseph, and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar? 2 And the Lord sent against him the rovers of the Chaldees, and the rovers of Syria, and the rovers of Moab, and the rovers of the children of Ammon: and he sent them against Juda, to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by his servants the prophets. 3 And this came by the word of the Lord against Juda, to remove them from before him for all the sins of Manasses which he did. 4 And for the innocent blood that he shed, filling Jerusalem with innocent blood: and therefore the Lord would not be appeased. 25 And it came to pass, when the burnt offering was ended, that Jehu commanded his soldiers and captains, saying: Go in, and kill them, let none escape. 10 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Ennom: that no man should consecrate there his son or his daughter through fire to Moloch. Then he cut off a piece of wood, and cast it in thither: and the iron swam. And when he had opened it, Eliseus said: Shoot an arrow. And he shot. 7 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his own country: for the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt, unto the river Euphrates. 27 And he walked in the ways of the house of Achab: and he did evil before the Lord, as did the house of Achab: for he was the son in law of the house of Achab. 8 Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas son of Joachaz, son of Jehu king of Israel, saying: Come let us see one another. 25 In the twelfth year of Joram son of Achab king of Israel, reigned Ochozias son of Joram king of Juda. 19 And out of the city one eunuch, who was captain over the men of war: and five men of them that had stood before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher the captain of the army who exercised the young soldiers of the people of the land: and threescore men of the common people, who were found in the city. 3 And one of them said: But come thou also with thy servants. 12 And when the king was come from Damascus, he saw the altar and worshipped it: and went up and offered holocausts, and his own sacrifice. 12 And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the driver thereof. 16 And all the strong men, seven thousand, and the artificers, and the smiths a thousand, all that were valiant men and fit for war: and the king of Babylon led them captives into Babylon. 17 And he appointed Matthanias his uncle in his stead: and called his name Sedecias. 14 Now Eliseus was sick of the illness whereof he died: and Joas king of Israel went down to him, and wept before him, and said: O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the guider thereof. 35 And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joachaz his son reigned in his stead. 2 Then one of the lords, upon whose hand the king leaned, answering the man of God, said: If the Lord should make hood-gates in heaven, can that possibly be which thou sayest? 9 So the king of Israel, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom went, and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey, and there was no water for the army, and for the beasts, that followed them. 25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and so long did the siege continue, till the head of an ass was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cabe of pigeon's dung, for five pieces of silver. 12 At that time Berodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of the Babylonians, sent letters and presents to Ezechias: for he had heard that Ezechias had been sick. 35 And it came to pass that night, that an angel of the Lord came, and slew in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. 32 In those days the Lord began to he weary of Israel: and Hazael ravaged them in all the coasts of Israel, 33 From the Jordan eastward, all the land of Galaad, and Gad, and Ruben, and Manasses, from Aroer, which is upon the torrent Amen, and Galaad, and Basan. And he said: Go. And Ezechias said to him: From a far country they came to me out of Babylon. And he took Joachaz away and carried him into Egypt, and he died there. 35 And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao, after he had taxed the land for every man, to contribute according to the commandment of Pharao: and he exacted both the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every man according to his ability: to give to Pharao Nechao. 8 And a messenger came, and told him, saying: They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said: Lay ye them in two heaps by the entering in of the gate until the morning. 9 And when it was light, he went out, and standing said to all the people: You are just: if I conspired against my master, and slew him, who hath slain all these? 21 For Josachar the son of Semaath, and Jozabad the son of Somer his servant struck him, and he died: and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amasias his son reigned in his stead. Chapter 3 1 And Joram the son of Achab reigned over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of m Josaphat king of Juda. 26 And as the king of Israel was passing by the wall, a certain woman cried out to him, saying: Save me, my lord O king. 26 But yet the Lord turned not away from the wrath of his great indignation, wherewith his anger was kindled against Juda: because of the provocations, wherewith Manasses had provoked him. 20 And his servants arose, and conspired among themselves, and slew Joas in the house of Mello in the descent of Sella. II Kings 14 In the second year of Joas son of Joachaz, king of Israel, reigned Amasias son of Joas king of Juda. 2 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign: and nine and twenty gears he reigned in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Joadan of Jerusalem. 3 And he did that which was right before the Lord, but yet not like David his father. And when he arose early in the morning, he saw all the bodies of the dead. 36 And Sennacherib king of the Assyrians departing went away, and he re- turned and abode in Ninive. 21 And Joram came to Seira, and all the chariots with him: and he arose in the night, and defeated the Edomites that had surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots, but the people fled into their tents. 4 And in the seventh year Joiada seat, and taking the centurions and the soldiers, brought them in to him into the temple of the Lord, and made a covenant with them: and taking an oath of them in the house of the Lord, shewed them the king's son: 5 And he commanded them, saying: This is the thing that you must do: 6 Let a third part of you go in on the sabbath, and keep the watch of the king's house. 24 And looking back, he saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord: and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of them two and forty boys. 24 And the king of the Assyrians brought people from Babylon, and from Cutha, and from Avah, and from Emath, and from Sepharvaim: and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. Tell me, what hast thou in thy house? 28 He went also with Joram son of Achab, to fight against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth Galaad, and the Syrians wounded Joram: 29 And he went back to be healed, in Jezrahel: because the Syrians had wounded him in Ramoth when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? 14 And I will leave the remnants of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies: and they shall become a prey, and a spoil to all their enemies. 15 Because they have done evil before me, and have continued to provoke me, from the day that their fathers came out of Egypt, even unto this day. 3 And when the seven years were ended, the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines, and she went forth to speak to the king for her house, and for her lands. 12 Elias answering, said: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. 16 Moreover Manasses shed also very much innocent blood, till he filled Jerusalem up to the mouth: besides his sins, wherewith he made Juda to sin, to do evil before the Lord. 7 And when the king of Israel had read the letter, he rent his garments, and said: Am I God, to be able to kill and give life, that this man hath sent to me, to heal a man of his leprosy? 21 And the king of Israel said to Eliseus, when he saw them: My father, shall I kill them? 30 Neither let him make you trust in the Lord, saying: The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of the Assyrians. 19 Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know, that thou art the Lord the only God. 15 And they went after them as far as the Jordan: and behold all the way was full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their fright, and the messengers returned end told the king. 24 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and Ochozias his son reigned in Iris stead. 7 And Achaz sent messengers to Theglathphalasar king of the Assyrians, saying: I am thy servant, and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who are risen up together against me. 30 When the king heard this, he rent his garments, and passed by upon the wall. And all the people saw the haircloth which he wore within next to his flesh. 31 And the king said: May God do so and so to me, and may he add more, if the head of Eliseus the son of Saphat shall stand on him this day. 16 But he answered: Fear not: for there are more with us than with them. 16 In the fifth year of Joram son of Achab king of Israel, and of Josaphat king of Juda, reigned Joram son of Josaphat king of Juda. 17 He was two and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 18 And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Achab had walked: for the daughter of Achab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. 7 But let there be no reckoning made with them of the money which they receive, but let them have it in their power, and in their trust. 24 And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying: Be not afraid to serve the Chaldees: stay in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 6 And the king asked the woman: and she told him. Dost thou trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 26 And as the king of Israel was passing by the wall, a certain woman cried out to him, saying: Save me, my lord O king. Then Lobna also revolted at the same time. 16 But he answered: As the Lord liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And when he pressed him, he still refused. 17 And Naaman said: As thou wilt: but I beseech thee, grant to me thy servant, to take from hence two mules' burden of earth: for thy servant will not henceforth offer holocaust, or victim, to other gods, but to the Lord. 22 Now Hazael king of Syria afflicted Israel all the days of Joachaz: 23 And the Lord had mercy on them, and returned to them because of his covenant, which he had made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob: and he would not destroy them, nor utterly cast them away, unto this present time. 17 And king Achaz took away the graven bases, and the laver that was upon them: and he took down the sea from the brazen oxen that held it up, and put it upon a pavement of stone. 18 The Musach also for the sabbath, which he had built in the temple: and the king's entry from without he turned into the temple of the Lord, because of the king of the Assyrians. 19 Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests: let none be wanting, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal: whosoever shall be wanting shall not live. 3 And he said to her: Go, borrow of all thy neighbours empty vessels not a few. 26 And they buried him in his sepulchre in the garden of Oza: and his son Josias reigned in his stead. 9 And he sent to him a captain of fifty, and the fifty men that were under him. And she answered: I thy handmaid have nothing in my house but a little oil, to anoint me. 8 And the priests were forbidden to take any more money of the people, and to make the repairs of the house. 9 And Joiada the high priest took a chest and bored a hole in the top, and set it by the altar at the right hand of them that came into the house of the Lord, and the priests that kept the doors put therein all the money that was brought to the temple of the Lord. 8 And there was a day when Eliseus passed by Sunam: now there was a great woman there, who detained him to eat bread; and as he passed often that way, he turned into her house to eat bread. So he made him ride in his chariot, 17 And brought him into Samaria. 11 And he stood with him, and was troubled so far as to blush: and the man of God wept. And Jehu said: If it please you, let no mall go forth or flee out of the city, lest he go, and tell in Jezrahel. 4 But the high places he did not destroy: for the people sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. 5 And the Lord struck the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and he dwelt in a free house apart: but Joatham the king's soil governed the palace, and judged the people of the land. 4 So he went with them. 20 And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and Ezechias his son reigned in his stead. 7 And he slew the sons of Sedecias before his face, and he put out his eyes, and bound him with chains, and brought him to Babylon. And he went up to him, and as he was sitting on the top of a hill, said to him: Man of God, the king hath commanded that thou come down. And he said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee; and they two went on together, 7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets followed them, and stood in sight at a distance: but they two stood by the Jordan. 8 And Elias took his mantle and folded it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and they both passed over on dry ground. 10 And Saphan the scribe told the king, saying: Helcias the priest hath delivered to me a book. 3 And when the seven years were ended, the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines, and she went forth to speak to the king for her house, and for her lands. And the rovers from Moab came into the land the same year. 21 And some that were burying a man, saw the rovers, and cast the body into the sepulchre of Eliseus. And when it had touched the bones of Eliseus, the man came to life, and stood upon his feet. 18 And the enemies came down to him, but Eliseus prayed to the Lord, saying: Strike, I beseech thee, this people with blindness. 8 In the eight and thirtieth year of Azarias king of Juda, reigned Zacharias son of Jeroboam over Israel in Samaria six months: 9 And he did that which is evil before the Lord, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat who made Israel to sin. 10 And Sellum the son of Jabes conspired against him: and struck him publicly and killed him, and reigned in his place. And the watchman told, saying: The messenger came to them, but he returneth not. And he called, 21 And he sent into all the borders of Israel, and all the servants of Baal came: there was not one left that did not come. 30 And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in Iris own sepulchre. 4 And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said: In Jerusalem I will put my name. And they sent after him to Lachis, and killed him there. And Eliseus said: The Lord hath shewn me that thou shalt be king of Syria. 10 And he gave them the spears, and the arms of king David, which were in the house of the Lord. 5 Then Basin king of Syria, and Phacee son of Romelia king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to fight: and they besieged Achaz, but were not able to overcome him. 27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azarias king of Juda reigned Phacee the son of Romelia over Israel in Samaria twenty years. 36 But the rest of the acts of Joatham, end all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? 37 In those days the Lord began to send into Juda Basin king of Syria, and Phacee the son of Romelia. 39 And one went out into the field to gather wild herbs: and he found something like a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds of the field, and filled his mantle, and coming back he shred them into the pot of pottage, for he knew not what it was. And I said to her on the next day: Give thy son that we may eat him. 25 And they destroyed the cities: and they filled every goodly field, every man casting his stone: and they stopt up all the springs of waters: and cut down all the trees that bore fruit, so that brick walls only remained: and the city was beset by the slingers, and a great part thereof destroyed. 32 Eliseus therefore went into the house, and behold the child lay dead on his bed. And when they were come to the Jordan they cut down wood. 5 And it happened, as one was felling some timber, that the head of the axe fell into the water: and he cried out, and said: Alas, alas, alas, my lord, for this same was borrowed. 2 And she arose, and did according to the word of the man of God: and going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days. 12 And he arose in the night and said to his servants: I tell you what the Syrians have done to us: They know that we suffer great famine, and therefore they are gone out of the camp, and lie hid in the fields, saying: When they come out of the city we shall take them alive, and then we may get into the city. 35 And when they went to bury her, they found nothing but the skull, and the feet, and the extremities of her hands. 30 And whatsoever shall be left of the house of Juda, shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward. 2 And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the idols of the nations, which the Lord destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel. And he said: Go, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor: and thou and thy sons live of the rest. 12 But the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, and his valour wherewith he fought against Amasias king of Juda, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? let him come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel. 16 At that time Ezechias broke the doors of the temple of the Lord, and the plates of gold which he had fastened on them, and gave them to the king of the Assyrians. 4 And Elias said to Eliseus: Stay here because the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. 34 And I will protect this city, and will save it for my own sake, and for David my servant's sake. 21 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Reblatha in the land of Emath: so Juda was carried away out of their land. 30 Now Osee son of Ela conspired, and formed a plot against Phacee, the son of Romelia, and struck him, and slew him: and reigned in his stead in the twentieth year of Joatham the son of Ozias. 2 And she arose, and did according to the word of the man of God: and going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days. 11 And the heart of the king of Syria was troubled for this thing. 40 But they did not hearken, but did according to their old custom. 27 And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying: Carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from thence captive, and let him go, and dwell with them: and let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land. And all the people saw the haircloth which he wore within next to his flesh. 24 And Hazael king of Syria died, and Benadad his son reigned in his stead. 21 And she went up and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, and shut the door: and going out, 22 She called her husband, and said: Send with me, I beseech thee, one of thy servants, and an ass that I may run to the man of God, and come again. 15 And he carried away Joachin into Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his eunuchs: and the judges of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem into Babylon. 10 And he gave them the spears, and the arms of king David, which were in the house of the Lord. 36 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel, in Samaria, was eight and twenty years. And the priest set guards in the house of the Lord. 17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasses, and all that he did, end his sin which he sinned, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? 43 And his servant answered him: How much is this, that I should set it before a hundred men? He said again: Give to the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the Lord: They shall eat, and there shall be left. 7 And when the king of Israel had read the letter, he rent his garments, and said: Am I God, to be able to kill and give life, that this man hath sent to me, to heal a man of his leprosy? 1 Now a certain woman of the wives of the prophets cried to Eliseus, saying: Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one that feared God, and behold the creditor is come to take away my two sons to serve him. Look then, when the messenger shall come, shut the door, and suffer him not to come in: for behold the sound of his master's feet is behind him. 4 And go in, and shut thy door, when thou art within, and thy sons: and pour out thereof into all those vessels: and when they are full take them away. 4 So he went with them. 18 Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. 19 And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done. and he shewed him the place. 9 And Saphan the scribe came to the king, and brought him word again concerning that which he had commanded, and said: Thy servants have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and they have given it to be distributed to the workmen, by the overseers of the works of the temple of the Lord. Hearken not to Ezechias, who deceiveth you, saying: The Lord will deliver us. 6 And the king asked the woman: and she told him. 10 See therefore now that there hath not fallen to the ground any of the words of the Lord, which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Achab, and the Lord hath done that which he spoke in the hand of his servant Elias. 21 And all the Moabites hearing that the kings were come up to fight against them, gathered together all that were girded with a belt upon them, and stood in the borders. And he said to him: Man of God, thus saith the king: Make haste and come down. 34 And when he was come in, to eat, and to drink, he said: Go, and see after that cursed woman, and bury her: because she is a king's daughter. 17 Of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have destroyed nations, and the lands of them all. 23 By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus, and have cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees. 24 And she saddled an ass, and commanded her servant: Drive, and make haste, make no stay in going. 24 Moreover the diviners by spirits, and soothsayers, and the figures of idols, and the uncleannesses, and the abominations, that had been in the land of Juda, and Jerusalem, Josias took away: that he might perform the words of the law, that were written in the book which Helcias the priest had found in the temple of the Lord. 5 So the servants of king Ezechias came to Isaias. 16 And the people going out pillaged the camp of the Syrians: and a bushel of fine flour was sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, according to the word of the Lord. 2 Now there had gone out robbers from Syria, and had led away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid, and she waited upon Naaman's wife. 15 Moreover the altar also that was at Bethel, and the high place, which Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, had made: both the altar, and the high place he broke down and burnt, and reduced to powder, and burnt the grove. 11 And again he sent to him another captain of fifty men, and his fifty with him. 17 And Eliseus prayed, and said: Lord, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw: and behold the mountain was full of horses, and chariots of fire round about Eliseus. 6 And I will add to thy days fifteen years: and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will protect this city for my own sake, and for David my servant's sake. 14 Then Ezechias king of Juda sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians to Lachis, saying: I have offended, depart from me: and all that thou shalt put upon me, I will bear. And he slew all that were left of Achab in Samaria, to a man, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by Elias. For thus saith the king of the Assyrians: Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come out to me: and every man of you shall eat of his own vineyard, and of his own fig tree: and you shall drink water of your own cisterns, 32 Till I come, and take you away to a land, like to your own land, a fruitful land, and plentiful in wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olives, and oil and honey, and you shall live, and not die. Chapter 11 1 And Athalia the mother of Ochozias seeing that her son was dead, arose, and slew all the royal seed. 9 So Naaman came with Iris horses and chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Eliseus: 10 And Eliseus sent a messenger to him, saying: Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall recover health, and thee shalt be clean. And he forced him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants, and they carried them before him. 36 Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Zebida the daughter of Phadaia of Ruma. 20 And he slew all the priests of the high places, that were there, upon the altars: and he burnt men's bones upon them: and returned to Jerusalem. And he took Joachaz away and carried him into Egypt, and he died there. 28 So one of the priests who had been carried away captive from Samaria, came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should worship the Lord. 8 Joachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, a and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Nohesta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 9 And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his father had done. where is the god of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava? And he said to them: Thus and thus did he speak to me: and he said: Thus saith the Lord: I have anointed thee king over Israel. 3 And he turned, and built up the high places which Ezechias his father had destroyed: and he set up altars to Baal, and made groves, as Achab the king of Israel had done: and he adored all the host of heaven, and served them. 30 And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in Iris own sepulchre. So as he turned, and was going away with indignation, 13 His servants came to him, and said to him: Father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, surely thou shouldst have done it: how much rather what he now hath said to thee: Wash, and thou shalt he clean? 32 And nevertheless they worshipped the Lord. And they made to themselves, of the lowest of the people, priests of the high places, and they placed them in the temples of the high places. 33 And when they worshipped the Lord, they served also their own gods according to the custom of the nations out of which they were brought to Samaria: 34 Unto this day they followed the old manner: they fear not the Lord, neither do they keep his ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob, whom he surnamed Israel: 35 With whom he made a covenant, and charged them, saying: You shall not fear strange gods, nor shall you adore them, nor worship them, nor sacrifice to them. 16 And as Josias turned himself, he saw there the sepulchres that were in the mount: and he sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burnt them upon the altar, and defiled it according to the word of the Lord, which the man of God spoke, who had foretold these things. 37 And Eliacim the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Ezechias, with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces. Chapter 24 21 And all the people of Juda took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amasias. 13 And he brought out from thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house: and he cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord. 14 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the valiant men of the army, to the number of ten thousand into captivity: and every artificer and smith: and none were left, but the poor sort of the people of the land. 15 And he carried away Joachin into Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his eunuchs: and the judges of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem into Babylon. 29 So we boiled my son, and ate him. 15 And he said: What did they see in thy house? But Joas was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 13 And he said to them: Go, and see where he is: that I may send, and take him. And they told him, saying: Behold he is in Dothan. 23 And when all the captains of the soldiers had heard this, they and the men that were with them, to wit, that the king of Babylon had made Godolias governor, they came to Godolias to Maspha, Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Johanan the son of Caree, and Saraia the son of Thanehumeth the Netophathite, and Jezonias the son of Maachathi, they and their men. 33 Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land from the hand of the king of Assyria? 2 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Abi the daughter of Zacharias. 3 And he did that which was good before the Lord, according to all that David his father had done. 4 He destroyed the n high places, and broke the statues in pieces, and cut down the groves, and broke the brazen serpent, which Moses had made: for till that time the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called its name Nohestan. 23 And his servants plotted against him, and slew the king in his own house. 2 He was sixteen years old, when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Jechelia of Jerusalem. 11 So Jehu slew all that were left of the house of Achab in Jezrahel, and all his chief men, and his friends, and his priests, till there were no remains left of him. 6 And he wrote letters the second time to them, saying: If you be mine, and will obey me, take the heads of the sons of your master, and come to me to Jezrahel by to morrow this time. 28 So Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel: 29 But yet he departed not from the sills of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, nor did he forsake the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan. 5 And the Lord struck the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and he dwelt in a free house apart: but Joatham the king's soil governed the palace, and judged the people of the land. And he lifted him up to him into the chariot, 16 And he said to him: Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord. 15 And the angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, saying: Go down with him, fear not. 29 Thus saith the king: Let not Ezechias deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of my hand. 31 Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. And the man of God said: Let her alone for her soul is in anguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. 28 And she said to him: Did I ask a son of my lord? 4 Wherefore thus saith the Lord: From the bed, on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die. 11 Naaman was angry and went away, saying: I thought he would hare come out to me, and standing would hare invoked the name of the Lord his God, and touched with his hand the place of the leprosy, and healed me. 12 Are not the Abana, and the Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, that I may wash in them, and be made clean? 8 And I will no more make the feet of Israel to be moved out of the land, which I gave to their fathers: only if they will observe to do all that I have commanded them according to the law which my servant Moses commanded them. 9 But they hearkened not: but were seduced by Manasses, to do evil more than the nations which the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel. 10 And the Lord spoke in the hand of his servants, the prophets, saying: 11 Because Manasses king of Juda hath done these most wicked abominations, beyond all that the Amorrhites did before him, and hath made Juda also to sin with his filthy doings: 12 Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Behold I will bring on evils upon Jerusalem and Juda: that whosoever shall hear of them, both his ears shall tingle. 21 Dost thou trust in Egypt a staff of a broken reed, upon which if a man lean, it will break and go into his hand, and pierce it? 15 And king Achaz commanded Urias the priest saying: Upon the great altar offer the morning holocaust, and the evening sacrifice, and the king's holocaust, and his sacrifice, and the holocaust of the whole people of the land, and their sacrifices, and their libations: and all the blood of the holocaust, and all the blood of the victim thou shalt pour out upon it: but the altar of brass shall be ready at my pleasure. 20 And Isaias the son of Amos sent to Ezechias, saying: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I have heard the prayer thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherib king of the Assyrians. 25 There was no king before him like unto him, that returned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with ail his strength, according to all the law of Moses: neither after him did there arise any like him. 5 So the servants of king Ezechias came to Isaias. 6 And Isaias said to them: Thus shall you say to your master: Thus saith the Lord: Be not afraid for the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me. 7 Behold I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a message, and shall return into his own country, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own country. He arose therefore, and went down with him to the king, 16 And said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast sent messengers to consult Beelzebub the god of Accaron, as though there were not a God in Israel, of whom thou mightest inquire the word; therefore from the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die. And he said to one of his servants: Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets. 9 And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his father had done.",

Wishes and expectations are one thing, and the possibilities are another\", explained Kocevski in answering the question what are the expectations of the people of Veles, which the municipality cannot fulfil no matter how much it wants to. The Municipality of Veles is one of the municipalities that can serve as an example according to the transparency in its work...\t\u041e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441 \u0435 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e... The Mayor openly and responsibly confirmed that he has neither been, nor has found himself or the municipality in a situation to have to apologise to the Veles public for any project they have implemented. Transparency and responsible policies, especially at the local level, have always been a problem, whereas citizens in most cases have encountered a closed door from the local government. As the Serbs and Croats say, you can't have the goat and the money. Their expectations are very high, they are eager to have their stacked problems solved, particularly from the aspect of improving the quality of life, and maybe because of this, the impression is as such. We must work honestly, transparently, respect the laws, for the work to be without corruption, and it is the citizens' right to evaluate whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied. I inherited the Municipality of Veles in a very bad situation in this mandate, third in a row, with debts of about three million euros. The mandate is 4 years, and the final assessments should, nevertheless, be given at the end\", replied Kocevski as a comment to a statement of a citizen from Veles in one of the many surveys of CIVIL Media, who considers that the mayor in his previous mandates did much more, and now the municipality has done nothing for the citizens. Kocevski also expressed dissatisfaction from the recent relationship between the local and central government, but hopes that the reforms in the local self-government, namely, the systematic change of the Law on local self-government as of January 1 will enable a better starting position for the municipalities. After the new government came, following the Colourful Revolution, citizens can much more openly and more judgmentally assess the work of both the central and local government. Kocevski explained also the manner in which the people in Veles inform themselves about his work and, in general, the work of the Municipality of Veles, using his official profile of mayor and the profile of the municipality on Facebook, as well as the website where all the documents, events and projects are published. Perhaps you also want to drive a BMW or a Mercedes, and live in a palace of 300 square meters, but you are satisfied with a more modest automobile and you live in modest conditions. I can responsibly say that I have not misused a single denar, that I have successfully managed the money that the municipality has, and I cannot be at fault if it is not enough because those are the possibilities. It is important, in the specific case for me, whether I have done the most of what is possible.

We spoke with the Mayor of the Municipality of Veles, Ace Kocevski, precisely about the expectations of the citizens of Veles, the possibilities of the Municipality, about transparency and responsibility, his personal responsibility as a mayor, but also of the local self-government, as well as about the relationship between the local and central government in implementing the anticipated and promised local reforms at the local elections. Adhering to the rules of responsible, accountable, ethical management of the municipality, I decided to pay back a large part of the debts. Now it is different, compared to the previous period. Moreover, Kocevski praised the cooperation with the civil sector, the public debates and discussions that they jointly organize on various topics and issues. We spoke with the Mayor of the Municipality of Veles, Ace Kocevski, precisely about the expectations of the citizens of Veles, the possibilities of the Municipality, about transparency and responsibility, his personal responsibility as a mayor, but also of the local self-government, as well as about the relationship between the local and central government in implementing the anticipated and promised local reforms at the local elections. That is not a solution. The expectations of the citizens, especially from the local government, are always high, the need of solving their problems quickly and efficiently is justified, but they do not always come across the implementation of responsible policies by the municipalities in which they live in, and very often they are neither familiar, nor feel the effects of the work of the local self-government. We are working on a plan for integrity of the municipality, no other municipality in the country has this, and I believe that in the next period we will set things even better in order for accountability and transparency to be at an even higher level than they are now\", outlined Kocevski.

Do you think that they have a final scenario for the next six months? In addition to that, we have no other option. As a democrat and a person who has been working for long years on integration and regional cooperation I respect every person's right to identify oneself as they feel. Regarding ergo omnes, I have a different definition. Elenovski: It is an interesting question, which unveils the essence of the process. In Bulgaria some friends tell me that about hundred thousand Bulgarians feel like Macedonians. Complying with basic democratic principles, I accept that. If the majority of ethnic Macedonian population and citizens of the Republic of Macedonia feel like Macedonians, then everybody else should accept it. Elefterotipia: Gruevski and Ivanov insist on expanding the agenda of dialogue by adding subjects like national identity, language etc. It is a good evidence of the manner in which the name dispute process has been working all of these years. We are in front of a great idea for Europe, which your people have decided to follow, and idea, which we also follow. With many difficulties we have reached the gateway to that civilization idea and concept and it is very hard to know that your next-door neighbor is preventing the entrance. It is illogical to negotiate the culture of people such as customs, folklore, songs, historical events. It is something that is simply accepted from the past and it is up to us to determine our future, more or less identifying with the past. On the other hand, the Republic of Macedonia has been recognized under its constitutional name from over than 125 countries in the world, and it is a serious right as well as a duty to my country to obey that fact. In our public, it has been created by other political structures, which are current and today, who were looking for their own political exemption on the very wrong side for the possible compromise. During his visit to Athens where he participated at the Conference for the NATO New Strategic Concept organized by the Atlantic Association of Greece, the president of the EACM, Lazar Elenovski, had an interview for the Greek newspaper Elefterotipia. My personal position is that identity and language cannot be negotiated. The identity which epistemologically speaking is very hard to define determines certain social diversity, inherence, belonging to a group within time and space. You know, our public has the impression that the Greek party has opened these questions of identity and language. You are here: Home|Media Centre |Interviews|Interview of the president of EACM, Lazar Elenovski for most known Greek newspaper Elefterotipia You know the story on your side the best. If 2.5 million Greeks feel like Macedonians I can only bow to that fact. Elefterotipia: Would you accept Nimetz proposition for Republic of North Macedonia and erga omnes usage? The mediator Nimetz has been for long years playing a very hard role and I admire his patience and desire he still has to find a solution for the dispute, having in mind that it is not only a matter of the name, but its usage as well, which uncovers many details about the usage of the international name of the country.

To confuse him, the Pah-wraith also sent him misleading visions. The existence of the Prophets and Sisko's role as their emissary constituted Star Trek's first venture into the realm of religion, a move that was somewhat controversial among mainstream Trek fans. It was no coincidence, then, that first contact by the United Federation of Planets was made by Starfleet officer Ben Sisko inside the wormhole in 2369. Sisko completed the plans set out for him by the Prophets by destroying both Dukat and, having been warned by the repentant Kai Winn, the book of ancient text. The Prophets said Sisko was of Bajor and returned Akorem to his own time. The Bajoran people celebrated the event and named Sisko as the Emissary of the Prophets to Bajor. As Sarah, the Prophet married Joseph Sisko and conceived a child. With few exceptions, in normal space, the Prophets could physically communicate with outsiders only by possessing a body and using it as a vessel. The host was conscious of what was happening but had no control over its actions.

The Prophets, also known as \"wormhole aliens\" (mainly by non-Bajorans), were non-corporeal lifeforms that resided in the only stable wormhole known to exist, located in the Bajoran system. The Emissary In 2331, a Prophet traveled to Earth and possessed the body of a Human named Sarah. It is thought that the Prophet visited Earth solely to ensure the birth of Benjamin Sisko. After doing so, it left Sarah's body, leaving her with a family that was not hers, so she left without explanation. In their natural state, the Prophets appeared as blue translucent energy capable of rapid movement throughout any environment.",

The discussion among several professors from different fields and a communicologist underlined the challenges that teachers had in yielding knowledge to students about the media, and offered ways on how to overcome these challenges. You can see the main conclusions of the discussion here: The key points of the discussion can be found here: What was happening at the 2020 Media Literacy Days? Trust in the experts and in those with experience in this field is crucial. On the other hand, we should also be skeptical and should not believe in everything that \"flies\" before our eyes on social networks. This is why thenmotto of DMP 2020 was \"Test Every News With No Excuse\". As part of the debate titled \"Let's have coffee\", the Institute for Communication Studies (ICS), asked the question: \"Do we need a media diet? Watch the video and learn more about the possible ways to achieve balance between offline and online reality. Media Literacy Days They used video messages to call on all interested citizens to join in their events. The discussions were about the extent of representation of women's knowledge, experience and expertise in the programme contents; if there was a gender gap in the journalists' salaries; if the implementation of the Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men was supervised and to what extent; how much the employers respected journalists' worker rights, as well as whether investigative journalism paid off. The event \"Gender, Pays and Broadcasting,\" organized by the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services, raised a number of issues related to the gender aspect of media literacy. The ICS research had shown that half of the young people aged 15-24 spent 1-3 hours a day on social networks, mostly on Instagram. The issue of how to recognize the lies about Covid-19 on the Internet was in the spotlight of the second event organized by the Youth Education Forum (MOF). As part of the CriThink project, a webinar was organized on the topic of \"Fighting Disinformation under the Conditions of Covid-19 Pandemic\". This topic was discussed with experts in the field of pedagogy and psychology, as well as with high-school and university students. At the public session of the Appeals Commission of the Council for Media Ethics, the message was highlighted that the public played a very important role in detecting the practice of media reporting, in noticing what meant an unethical and unprofessional reporting, in assisting the self-regulatory body to more easily identify these cases and in promoting the process of professionalization of media's operations. From a deadly virus controlled by the 5G network to chipping and controlling humanity, the conspiracy theories have travelled the world spreading false information that people still believe. On this occasion, Minister of Education and Science Mila Carovska pointed out that a new concept of primary education was being under preparation to include media literacy as of next year, as an approach to learning a number of school subjects. This was the second time that our country joined in the marking of the Global Week on Media and InformationnLiteracy, during which UNESCO sent out a call on all to fight disinformation using media literacy as a powerful tool, and take part in the events dedicated to medianliteracy regardless of where in the world they lived or worked. The discussion raised questions such as whether journalists need to build media literacy capacities, what patterns disinformation have, hate speech and propaganda, the impact of politics on the media sphere and whether there were strategies for verifying the truthfulness of information. Presented at the event were some of the conclusions obtained through the research conducted by Eurothink and Metamorphosis, RESIS and AAAVMS, as well as MIM and CIVIL. The Macedonian Institute for Media (MIM) and the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services (AAAVMS) organized an online roundtable on media literacy and education.",

Belgiumdeclared a day of morning, while both the European and Swiss parliaments observed minute of silence. The prosecutor for the Swiss canton Valais, Oliver Elsig, said investigators were looking into a couple of possible causes: a technical defect or human error. Belgian authorities were preparing to fly home the bodies of the 28 victims, including 22 children, on Thursday. The tour bus was new and well maintained and according to the information we have, the driver was well rested. Investigators have yet to determine the cause of a fatal bus crash in a Swiss tunnel. The Belgian-registered bus was on its way back to Belgium from Switzerland when it crashed into the wall of a tunnel, killing 28 people and wounding the 24 other passengers. We will examine everything to find out what happened, Elsig said. An autopsy is to be performed on the driver to determine whether a sudden illness could have caused him to lose control of the bus. It happened only about half an hour after setting off from the Val d'Anniviers region, where the schoolchildren had spent the previous few days on a skiing vacation. Around 100 relatives had flown to Switzerland on a government plane the day before.",

In 2001 Macedonia was affected by an armed conflict between the governmental security forces (army and police) and armed groups of ethnic Albanians (organized in the so-called National Liberation Army \u2013 NLA). The internationally-brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement (OFA) put an end to the conflict. The purpose of OFA is to promote peaceful and harmonious development of civil society, with respect of the ethnic identity and interests of all citizens of Macedonia. The project will analyze the effects of OFA, especially in terms of confidence building among all ethnic communities in Macedonia, with focus on non-majority communities represented with under 20% in the population, normative acts adopted for protection of rights of communities, level of implementation of equitable representation on local and central level, role of institutions tasked for protection of rights of communities and their relations with the civil sector as well as the level of interethnic confidence among different ethnic groups. To assess the situation of non-majority communities in political and developmental processes on local and central level, to propose measures for promotion and protection of rights of non-majority communities and to improve their integration. In addition to the interviews with the relevant actors, also a poll will be conducted on a representative sample in selected municipalities. Direct beneficiaries of the project, the part implemented by MCIC (two roundtables) and the national conference in cooperation with ADI, are: The implementation period is January 1 \u2013 October 15, 2010. The first one on \"Preserving the Cultural Diversity\" will be realized for 15 representatives of the civil society organizations and will be focused on preserving the cultural identity of their communities. The findings will serve as a basis for further discussions with the relevant actors and undertaking measures for improving the situation. The overall objective of the project is to enhance the dialogue among all ethnic communities in Macedonia, with focus on issues affecting the non-majority communities in the spirit and context of EU integration, by establishing communication networks among the non-majority communities, civil society sector, central and local authorities and international factors. Primary target group is the governmental institutions established for protection of the rights of communities on national and local level (Secretariat for Implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement \u2013 SIOFA); National Committee on Relations among Communities; local committees on relations among the communities; civil society organizations active in the field of minority rights and international organizations. The roundtable will assess the needs of these communities and their respective organizations (from sociological, cultural and economic perspective). The assumptions affecting the realization of project objectives are: readiness of local and central authorities to participate in all stages of the project; representatives of the other relevant civil society organizations and representatives of non-majority communities are willing to take part in the project; civil society organizations active in this field are interested for establishing a network through which they could address the problems of non-majority communities. The roundtable will discuss the survey findings as well as the measures to be undertaken to improve the situation with non-majority communities. However, even nine years after its signing, the communities represented with less than 20% in the population (Turks, Roma, Serbs, Boshniaks and Vlachs) in Macedonia voice their dissatisfaction with the speed of exercising of their rights and the low political power vested in their representatives. The Republic of Macedonia is a multiethnic and multi-confessional society (64% of the population is comprised of Macedonians, 25% Albanians, 4% Turks, 3% Roma, 2% Serbs, 1% Boshniaks, 0,5% Vlach and 0,5% others) and since gaining its independence it has made progress in providing minority rights. OFA implementation includes several key elements: decentralization, equitable and proportional representation, protection of culture and identity of communities as well as establishment of special legal procedures, such as the Badenter's principle for the laws affecting the culture and identity of communities and establishing special Committees on Relations among Communities. 20 participants at the second roundtable, representatives of SIOFA; National Committee on Relations among Communities; Agency for Protection of Non-Majority Communities; The project is complex and it involves heterogeneous beneficiaries, i.e. representatives of all sectors in the society. OFA emphasizes that the agreement protects the interests of all its citizens. Expected results of the project are: strengthened capacities of the National Committee on Relations among Communities, Agency for Protection of Non-Majority Communities and local committee on relations among communities in respect of their role in confidence building, improved cooperation of the civil sector with the relevant actors in this field, improved status and protection of rights of non-majority communities, including their respective civil society organizations. Citizens coming from these ethnic communities will be also invited to attend the event. At the end of the project, a conference will be organized together with ADI in order to promote the report. This project was developed with an aim to examine the situation of these communities.",

        "text":"Delcev: Payment of K-15 is taboo subject and dream of police officers All employees in the police, not only union workers, need to very carefully get into the essence of matters related to these laws and secondary acts, which are the basis and foundation for the work of the police officers. What I would like to convey to the public is that payment of K-15 in the western world is a regular practice, but here, it is a dream of MOI employees. Proportionally, their income is far lower than that of the other administrative workers, and we must take into account the weight of the work they perform. Pressures have gone so far that some of the employed servants have been transferred to other workplaces with which they are not familiar with and for which they need additional training or adjustment to that the position! This is a public secret and very little is spoken in this regard, perhaps because it concerns the police. MOI perhaps is least included in terms of political abuse of the employees, but if we take into consideration all the analysis, we come to our realizations and conclusions that at the end of the day, we are all losers. In this manner they perform a serious attack on trade unionism. CIVIL Media: What are the social and political consequences from abusing the issues in the area of social justice? It is a secondary act of the Labor Relations Law, signed by the representative union of the police, that is, by the Macedonian police union. What are your realizations and analysis? A high percentage of employed officers, for various reasons, and usually at their own request, leave the police because they are not satisfied with their salaries. Their interest in the issue is perhaps a bit wrong. We are saying this, especially I am, who has been for an entire decade leading this structure of people from the police, who need security, independence... Opportunity should be given to social justice within the functioning of the police, and for the real problems of workers who live off their own work in the police to be solved through trade unions. However, if we summarize the results relating to the social, or financial payment of workers, we come to devastating results regarding the employees. This is a public secret and very little is spoken in this regard, perhaps because it concerns the police. CIVIL Media: Which promises for social justice are realistic, and which promises are a kind of political corruption, or are playing with the expectations of the voters? Some of them are leaving temporarily, seeking work outside the country, and some permanently. I have already mentioned the consequences, leaving the country, quality police staff leaving the job, who have performed their work honestly and with dignity for many years... in addition to the insufficient financial compensation, there is also the pressure that police officers feel at their workplace, due to the lawsuits they have initiated. Employees have won most of the lawsuits against the Ministry of Interior in court, which causes significant outflow of funds from the budget.\t\u041d\u0430\u0458\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043b \u043e\u0434 \u0442\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u041c\u0412\u0420, \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0433\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u0434, \u0438 \u0441\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u0431\u0443\u045f\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0442. They should let our view be a comprehensive base that will be taken seriously, and which refers to the actual needs of the work and functioning of the MOI. We have come to the conclusion that the political parties, regardless of whether they are ruling or opposition parties and regardless of ethnicity, that in general, the parties of the political scene in the country are a potential opportunity and basis - for some citizens to enter the system of politically taking sides. We are processing in an analytical manner, within our capabilities, what we have as knowledge and we have been conducting surveys \u2013 as of 2007, until today. My political determination can never be set as a priority in the manner of solving problems, just because I am Macedonian or because I am a radical... No, on the contrary. What I have been able to notice lately is the increasing number of people with master's degrees and PhD, dealing with the issue of - Human resources, and they are showing great concern for the retention of the personnel in the police and in general, in the security sphere. Workers who are nearing retirement also face the same problem. CIVIL Media: What can and what should the institutions, political parties, unions and civil society do in order to prevent the abuse of socially disadvantaged categories, and overall the topics in the area of social justice in the political and electoral context? We know that in the past no one was held responsible, we also know about \"great\" superiors who have been politically covering their own jobs and who for decades have not moved from their beautiful, warm and sweet armchairs, and all this is at the expense of those workers who on the other hand, are seeking ways to escape and solve their problems by leaving their work and their own country. Delcev: The Independent Police Trade Union has been analyzing the situation relating to the employees of MOI and the police, for many years. As a result of this, jobs of individuals who have submitted complaints have been threatened. Payment of the K-15 benefit is part of the planned budget, while K-15 remains a taboo subject, a dream of employees that they will be paid in a regular manner. Delcev: In terms of what they should do, the answer is short and clear - to leave us, the employees of certain institutions, to function within the framework of these institutions and through union organizations that are already functioning, that is, for us to freely express what we feel as a serious need through these institutions. They believe that they know who and what should be done, and unintentionally harm the work of the Independent Trade Union, through its trade union organizations throughout the Republic. This will reduce the outflow of funds from institutions due to charges submitted by dissatisfied employees. Employees have won most of the lawsuits in court, which causes significant outflow of funds from the budget. Pressures have gone so far that some employed servants have even been transferred to other workplaces with which they are not familiar with and for which they need additional training or adjustment to that the position!\", said Goce Todev Delcev, leader of the Independent Police Trade Union, in an interview for CIVIL Media. This is the main reason for them leaving their jobs, which is completely understandable. By this, we will have a better and more stable police structure in Republic of Macedonia. Delcev: I will start with the second part of the question, with the promise concerning employees in the police, especially workers who are members of the Independent trade union - the collective agreement. They also have to adapt, because they need to earn their salary, to get paid, as provided by the law on police. All articles associated with the Labor Relations Law, specifically with the Law on Police and Internal Affairs, as well as the collective agreement, have been developed with various regulations. Delcev: Low salaries, or the inability of employees in the police living on that salary to solve their financial needs, to support their families in a dignified manner... Also, not to allow certain heads or assistant directors to be shifted to positions of officials. For the same reason, many lawyers have been activated for payment of K-15 to be made, even though it has been provided for in the budget and is an annual salary supplement. What remains for us to inform the public is the social aspect of the employed officers in the MOI. I must emphasize that the Independent Police Trade Union also includes police officers from the forestry, prison and court police and those employed in security agencies from within the private sector in the Republic of Macedonia.",

The same year there were 266,000 deaths. The activities for this purpose were implemented by the Ministry of Health with the Institute for Public Health and the Centres for Public Health, the gynecologists and cytological laboratories. HPV infections are very common and occur in about 80 percent of all sexually active people, whether they have symptoms or not. The link between cancer and HPV is the causing changes in cells of the cervix, which may lead to the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, which can lead to cancer.

For other useful links and contact details go to Community Support Services. Often children with serious behavioural issues can get into serious trouble later in life. You can also watch this video version of the brochure together with your child. When your child is involved in an incident, always take the situation seriously and make extra efforts to fully understand both sides of the story. Children need \"help\" to deal with their issues and help to correct their wrongs. Download a copy of a child-friendly brochure for children who find themselves suspected of breaking the law, or have actually broken the law. If your child has been a victim of violence, you can also contact Counseling Center for Parents and Children, Kole Nedelkovski Primary School, Antonie Grubisik 8, Skopje, on (02) 321 4338. Prevention methods are effective ways to reduce violence against and among children and create positive behaviour for learning. Contact your local Centre for Social Work and ask for help. However, prevention alone cannot fully wipe out violence behaviour among all children. You may also need support from professionals. Make sure your children understand the hurt or damage that they have caused as a result of their behaviour. The key to remember is that \"punishment is not the answer\". Here are some tips we hope will help you:",

The Assistant High Commissioners visited a COVID-19 treatment facility in the local community of Ukhiya, which was built in just 8 weeks. The Government has set a positive example by including the Rohingya refugees in the national COVID-19 response plan and the related national vaccination plan. The Assistant High Commissioners emphasized that the responsibility for the current Rohingya refugee situation in Bangladesh rests with Myanmar, and that is where the solution lies. Additional challenges have been presented by COVID-19 and related restrictions in the camps.

U tom periodu palma ne podnosi jako sunce i promaju... http:\/\/poljoprivreda.info\/?oid=7&id=65 Palma ne trpi promaju. As plants grow and especially after watering, the weight of the basket increases. The two most important factors for planting and nursing decorative trees are the quality of the soil and the type of climate. Even though the automatic watering system existed, during the dry periods of our Toronto summers the baskets had to be watered manually. Periodically, I'd spend about 2 days going through them all, cleaning out dead growth, dead-heading flowers to stimulate more blooms or checking to see if the drip lines were working properly. The additional soil cover will keep them cool. With hanging baskets and most potted annual displays, the roots are tightly packed into their pots and are actively competing for water. About 100 or so baskets of mixed annual flowers were on display in this area. Each basket was connected to several drip lines set up on a timer for a water feed. Even so, they deserve a place with the daffodils and hyacinths in your spring garden. Whether chains, ropes, wires or macrame, too much weight for the support may mean a total loss if the basket crashes to the ground... http:\/\/www.hort.purdue.edu\/ext\/HO-126.pdf Improper drainage is a frequent cause of poor plant growth in containers. Therefore, it is very important that thought be given to the method of support used. If you are watering with a wand connected to the hose (recommended for delicate annual plantings), water until you see it flowing out the drip holes of the container, stop for a minute or so, then repeat 1 or 2 more times. At least one attraction for birds is a varied ecosystem with different kinds of trees and shrubs. http:\/\/landscapearchitecturemagazine.org\/2012\/03\/08\/bird-is-the-word\/ \u043fokpaj \u0434\u0438Bep\u0437\u0438\u0444\u0438ka\u0446\u0438jaTa Ha pacTeH\u0438ja \u0431\u0438TeH e \u0438 H\u0438BH\u0438oT \u0438\u0437\u0431op, \u043boka\u043bHo \u0437a \u043boka\u043bH\u0438 [1][2][3] If the water is not fed for a long enough period, the very center of the root clump will tend to dry out resulting in the death of your flowers! The surroundings of the location, the climate and the soil, allows us to grow our decorative trees with extremely compact root ball and very strong and resistible plant.

Letting it sit until no bubbles come out from the soil is the best way to ensure even water distribution throughout the root clump. A large, bold container filled with small delicate plants is usually inappropriate. Healthy plants require adequate drainage. (feed with a bit of slow-release fertilizer in spring) http:\/\/landscape-design.blogspot.com\/2006\/12\/hanging-baskets.html trim all the growth back before it hits, store the plants indoors in a cool place keeping soil moist and you can have that same planting arrangement for next spring! Three or four punctures made with a sharp knife through lined containers will also supply necessary drainage. Hanging Baskets The Hanging Basket Garden in High Park was just one of my areas of care during my days as a gardener for the City of Toronto. Follow those simple suggestions and your baskets\/pots should last till the first frost in fall. Decide whether the container will become an important part of the total design or is merely there to support the plants. The quality of the soil enriched with high volume of clay at the land under concession in Macedonia and the climate type, offer great prospects for planting and nursery of decorative trees. The baskets were grown in the City Greenhouses first, then my colleagues and I would spend a day arranging them outside when there was no risk of frost. Water as often as needed (every 2 to 3 days), but at least once a week during drought periods, give that container a great soaking by filling a bucket with water and submersing the container in the bucket.",

They culminated in September 2019 with the passage of the two historic laws to guarantee women and men equal opportunities and to protect women from violence and oppression. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Uzbekistan has seen an increase in domestic violence. Although violence against women is illegal under existing criminal laws, no provisions existed for the registration of gender-based violence cases, nor for measures that are recommended to support and protect victims. Moreover, under this law, the Government has committed to providing support to affected women and girls, including free legal, economic, social, psychological, medical, and other services. It was frank, open, and, probably, one of the most inspiring meetings I have virtually attended during my first six months in Uzbekistan. The official statistics on violence against women and girls in the country are not yet accessible. Alongside the economic hardships, which have caused income and job losses in many families, there has been an increasing rate of physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse against women and girls.

It was frank, open, and, probably, one of the most inspiring meetings I have virtually attended during my first six months in Uzbekistan. The law to protect women from violence establishes a legal basis for police complaints against gender-based violence, opening the door for the systematic protection of victims. The official statistics on violence against women and girls in the country are not yet accessible. And in more than 30 countries, there are still no laws specifically addressing domestic violence, meaning that men using violence against their wives face little risk of being prosecuted. We will work hard to help the Government implement the new law to better protect women and girls across the country. Since 2017, the country\u2019s Parliament and Government have been making significant efforts to increase the economic and social inclusion of women, which were part of the transformative reform agenda launched after many years of stagnation and isolation from the outside world. They culminated in September 2019 with the passage of the two historic laws to guarantee women and men equal opportunities and to protect women from violence and oppression.

Last month in Tashkent, I had a chance to participate in the online launch of a Global Campaign calling for an end to violence against women and girls.

It was frank, open, and, probably, one of the most inspiring meetings I have virtually attended during my first six months in Uzbekistan. The event involved speakers from various government, non-government, and international organizations and focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls in Uzbekistan. Globally, gender-based violence has increased significantly in 2020 in most countries for which data is available. The passage of the new legislation recognizes gender-based violence as a distinct type of criminal offense, and sets out special requirements for the registration, processing, and enforcement of these cases. At the same time, women across the world have experienced decreased access to services, including vital sexual and reproductive health services, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services during the pandemic. The passage of these important implementation measures is one of the policy actions that will be backed under a Development Policy Loan that the World Bank\u2019s Board of Executive Directors approved this week.

Misajlovski in Berlin: public bid opened for stage two of the Pletvar - Gradsko express way Speaking at the Berlin Innotrans international fair for transportation technology, Macedonian Minister Vlado Misajlovski said that the international bid to build the second stage of the Prilep - Gradsko express way has been made public, in cooperation with the European Union. Another major project whose second stage of construction is now opened to potential bidders, Misajlovski said, is the railway link to Bulgaria. The project is divided in three sections, one is under construction, the second is now upcoming and the third will be completed in the coming years. Prilep, and by extension Bitola and the wider Pelagonija region, are linked to the main Corridor 10 highway through a narrow mountainous road going through the Pletvar pass. By the end of this year, we expect to select the construction company and we can have work started in the first half of 2017\", Misajlovski said, adding that the second stage of the road should be completed by 2019. Work is underway on the line between Kumanovo and Beljakovce, and the second stage would extend this line to Kriva Palanka, in a project worth 147 million EUR. Misajlovski said that another part of the Corridor 8, the railway line between Kicevo and the border with Albania near Struga is also in the planning stage.",

The team includes American Andrew Morgan, Russian Alexander Skvortsov, and Italian Luca Parmitano. This brings space exploration full circle in some ways: In Greek mythology, Artemis, a Greek goddess, was the twin of Apollo. NASA focuses on the early stage science and hands-off mainstream development to those companies, such as SpaceX or Boeing, who, unlike the American taxpayer, are willing to take the financial risk. Half a century ago, a team consisting of pilot Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin (right) and Neil Armstrong took off from the US base to reach Earth's natural satellite. Even the Apollo missions were deeply steeped in commercial industry \u2014 the Lunar Module on that historic Apollo 11 mission was made by an old US defense contractor called Grumman. Putting people on the moon France, China and India have similar intentions \u2014 primarily, it's said, to protect satellite infrastructure in space. France, China and India have similar intentions \u2014 primarily, it's said, to protect satellite infrastructure in space. When people view the installation from 211 meters (about 700 feet) away, it would be exactly the same as the view from the moon in 1969. They go to space, return to Earth, and are launched again. The Washington Monument, a 169-meter (555 feet) pillar of marble in the US capital, was turned into a display with images of the lunar mission and a moving projection of the 111-meter Saturn V rocket, which took the Apollo 11 astronauts to the moon. Originally built for the Apollo moon missions, which flew from 1969 to 1972, the 39A launch site was modified for the Space Shuttle program. In the US alone, at least 3,800 contractors are working on Orion and the rocket that will launch it, the Space Launch System (SLS). The three capsules: quick facts Its human crew, veteran American astronauts Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken, join the ISS Expedition 63. Labyrinthine tribute In Wistow, Leicestershire, east of Birmingham, the owners of an 8-acre maze that attracts more than 25,000 visitors every summer chose to mark the 50th anniversary of the moon landing with a design depicting an astronaut. The ultimate goal, however, is much further away: a journey to Mars. On Saturday, NASA replayed the original broadcast of the landing seen by half a billion people in 1969. Boeing is also collaborating with NASA to develop a competitor capsule called CST-100 Starliner. SpaceX has set its sights on Mars, while Orion is tied to the Artemis moon program, which aims to send astronauts to the lunar surface by 2024. World marks 50 years since the Apollo 11 moon landing Monument to Apollo 11 Americans showed their pride over the 1969 moon landing with events across the country. The program is set to include a platform that would orbit the moon, called Gateway, with astronauts traveling in the Orion crew capsule (pictured). The two men stayed on the lunar surface for a little over 2 1\/2 hours. NASA plans to send new astronauts to the moon by 2024 with its Artemis program, named after the goddess and twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology.

SpaceX has set its sights on Mars, while Orion is tied to the Artemis moon program, which aims to send astronauts to the lunar surface by 2024. NASA's collaboration with SpaceX is part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program. NASA has awarded upward of $400 million (and more) to stimulate efforts in the private sector to development and demonstrate safe, reliable and cost-effective crew transportation systems. And there's the Orion spacecraft, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency, ESA. On Saturday, NASA replayed the original broadcast of the landing seen by half a billion people in 1969. Nothing happens in space without collaboration: The Orion spacecraft is a multinational effort by the USA and Europe That project is both non-commercial and commercial, with contractors like Airbus constructing its service modules. In the US alone, at least 3,800 contractors are working on Orion and the rocket that will launch it, the Space Launch System (SLS). That's when NASA's final space shuttle, the STS-135, flew to the International Space Station (ISS). Parkes was one of three tracking stations around the world tasked with beaming live pictures of the event. The program sounds new, like a break with tradition, but it's not. Even the Apollo missions were deeply steeped in commercial industry \u2014 the Lunar Module on that historic Apollo 11 mission was made by an old US defense contractor called Grumman. Space flight doesn't stop While the Apollo 11 veterans attended the celebrations in the US, a team of astronauts took off for the International Space Station (ISS) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. In Shanghai, an artistic installation by UK artist Luke Jerram shows a high-definition image of the Earth taken in 1972. And there's the Orion spacecraft, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency, ESA. That includes companies such Amazon-founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, the United Launch Alliance, to name a few.

This brings space exploration full circle in some ways: In Greek mythology, Artemis, a Greek goddess, was the twin of Apollo. Australians also marked the Apollo 11 anniversary by gathering around the Parkes Radio Telescope for a screening of the 2000 film \"The Dish.\" The Washington Monument, a 169-meter (555 feet) pillar of marble in the US capital, was turned into a display with images of the lunar mission and a moving projection of the 111-meter Saturn V rocket, which took the Apollo 11 astronauts to the moon. Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, died in 2012. World marks 50 years since the Apollo 11 moon landing Crew Dragon does, however, break with at least one tradition \u2014 spacecraft interior design that leaves something to be desired. The capsule is a total upgrade in space interiors, as are the spacesuits. Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, died in 2012. While the Apollo 11 veterans attended the celebrations in the US, a team of astronauts took off for the International Space Station (ISS) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule for human spaceflight may be the first to pass its uncrewed test stages, but it still has to be fully certified for operation. This picture, taken by Armstrong, shows Aldrin planting a long sheet of foil designed to capture material radiated by the sun. NASA's collaboration with SpaceX is part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program. The ultimate goal, however, is much further away: a journey to Mars. It seems that every effort has been made to draw a direct parallel between the last human spaceflight from America, and the Apollo moon missions before that. Further south in London, the city marked the jubilee by showing a mosaic image of the moon at Piccadilly Circus at the moment of the 1969 touchdown. Originally built for the Apollo moon missions, which flew from 1969 to 1972, the 39A launch site was modified for the Space Shuttle program. And in 2014 SpaceX signed a 20-year lease to run the site. A new commercial era? SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule for human spaceflight may be the first to pass its uncrewed test stages, but it still has to be fully certified for operation.",

World Obama's Mideast position ruffles Israeli feathers In Barack Obama's speech on the Middle East and North Africa, the US president said America would support any country promoting reform and democracy. At a time when the people of the Middle East and North Africa are casting off the burdens of the past, the drive for a lasting peace that ends the conflict and resolves all claims is more urgent than ever, he said. Yinam Cohen, spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Germany, downplayed talk of stark differences between Israel and the US in the wake of Obama' speech. The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy, Obama said. President Assad now has a choice: He can lead that transition, or get out of the way. The viability of a Palestinian state cannot come at the expense of Israel's existence, said Netanyahu, who is scheduled to meet Obama at the White House later Friday. US President Barack Obama delivered a highly-anticipated speech on Thursday aimed at redefining America's role in the Middle East and North Africa in light of the series of uprisings that have swept the region in the last six months.

        "text":"The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets (VTsIK) undermined the authority of the Provisional Government but also of the moderate socialist leaders of the Soviets. The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, printed millions of ruble notes, and by 1917, inflation had made prices increase up to four times what they had been in 1914. Tsar Nicholas was blamed for all of these crises, and what little support he had left began to crumble. These included that the Soviets take power (as seen in the slogan \"all power to the Soviets\") and denouncing the liberals and social revolutionaries in the Provisional Government, forbidding co-operation with it. It is possible the left SR had a good chance to reach more than 25% of the votes and thereby legitimate the October revolution but we can only guess. A short wave of patriotic nationalism ended in the face of defeats and poor conditions on the Eastern Front of World War I. The Tsar made the situation worse by taking personal control of the Imperial Russian Army in 1915, a challenge far beyond his skills. A series of political crises \u2013 see the chronology below \u2013 in the relationship between population and government and between the Provisional Government and the Soviets (which developed into a nationwide movement with a national leadership). There was also no running water, and piles of human waste were a threat to the health of the workers. The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before World War I. Because of late industrialization, Russia's workers were highly concentrated. The representatives of the Provisional Government agreed to \"take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies\", though they were also determined to prevent interference which would create an unacceptable situation of dual power. In the autumn of 1915, Nicholas had taken direct command of the army, personally overseeing Russia's main theatre of war and leaving his ambitious but incapable wife Alexandra in charge of the government. Though Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik Party, it has been argued that since Lenin was not present during the actual takeover of the Winter Palace, it was really Trotsky's organization and direction that led the revolution, merely spurred by the motivation Lenin instigated within his party. Early in 1916, Guchkov discussed with senior army officers and members of the Central War Industries Committee about a possible coup to force the abdication of the Tsar. Despite growing support for the Bolsheviks, buoyed by maxims that called most famously for \"all power to the Soviets\", the party held very little real power in the moderate-dominated Petrograd Soviet. In fact, historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have asserted that Lenin's exhortations for the Soviet Council to take power were intended to arouse indignation both with the Provisional Government, whose policies were viewed as conservative, and the Soviets themselves, which were viewed as subservients to the conservative government. The Civil War began in early 1918 with domestic anti-Bolshevik forces confronting the nascent Red Army. Food scarcity had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did not lie in any failure of the harvests, which had not been significantly altered during wartime. In April and May 1918, the looming civil war led the Bolsheviks to move the family to the stronghold of Yekaterinburg. There was enormous discontent with Russia's involvement in the war, and many were calling for an end to it. The situation climaxed with the October Revolution in 1917, a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the Soviets. In the elections the Bolshevik party received 25% of the votes and the Socialist-Revolutionaries as much as 58%. A period of dual power ensued, where the Provisional Government held state power while the network of Soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes, as well as, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class.",

Divine Revelation ensures the unity of faith and the salvation of the faithful: \"No one can come to me unless he is drawn by the Father who sent me\" (John 6.44). Orthodoxy has always maintained that the unity of the churches can be found only in love in Christ, between people, and in the reconciliation of the Churches sustained by the unity of the Holy Trinity. The road to the Church\u2019s unity is a difficult one but not an impossible one. Centuries of division between them have given rise to difficulties which man cannot overcome by himself and the solution can only come from God and his servants. Let us recall that at the end of the Holy Orthodox Liturgy, as a sign of unity and reconciliation, His Holiness Pope John Paul II and His Beatitude Teoctist, Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, exchanged gold chalices representing the desire to partake together of the Body and Blood of our Lord in the Holy Eucharist. One of the highlights of the meeting was the reading of the Nicene Creed without the Filioque. Restoration of the visible unity of Christian Churches has been a constant concern with Orthodoxy. Orthodox, Catholics and Protestants participated in this great event with great hopes for reconciliation, because the Romanian Orthodox Church has succeeded on this occasion in presenting the image of reconciliation in Christ. The visit took place under the sign of the work of the Holy Spirit. The Christian faith shows that the Church of Christ is one. Pope John Paul II visited the Patriarchate of Constantinople and a joint declaration was signed 'not only in view of the progress toward re-establishing full communion between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, but also in view of the contribution of the dialogues to its unity' (L'Osservatore Romano N\/49, dJc, 1979). In December 1987 the Ecumenical Patriarch visited Rome. I shall insist a little on a unique event in the bimillenary history of the Orthodox church of Romania, that is, the first visit of a Polish Pope to a sister Orthodox Church in the Spirit of unity and reconciliation. The Christian faith shows that the Church of Christ is one. Every local Church enjoys specific charisms. Unity of faith is the guarantee of the presence of Christ in the Church. I cannot, at this historic moment, omit to mention Your Beatitude\u2019s visit to the Vatican ten years ago, which showed a firm desire to freely establish friendly ecclesiastical relations for the benefit of the members of both Churches. I thank you in the name of the Romanian Orthodox Church for your presence at the Holy Orthodox Liturgy for which you show so much appreciation in your pastoral letter Orientale Lumen.\" The unity of the Church of Christ is founded on the communion of fullness because Orthodox ecclesiology is Trinitarian; it is also a theology of the communion of the Church which can be defined as a mystery of the communion of the Holy Trinity in the world. According to Ephesians 4.5-6: \"There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God who is Father of all, over all, through all and within all.\" It is the first time Divine Providence offers me the opportunity to dedicate an apostolic visit to a mainly Orthodox nation, and this could not have happened without the brotherly availability of the Holy Synod and the Venerable Romanian Orthodox Church. The New Testament also speaks clearly of the unity of the Holy Trinity: \"The Father and I are one\" (John 10.30). Therefore the unity of the Church is preserved as long as the unity of the Spirit is preserved. Centuries of division between them have given rise to difficulties which man cannot overcome by himself and the solution can only come from God and his servants. The charism and responsibility of the Romanian Orthodox Church with that of the Universal Orthodox Church has been to keep and witness throughout history \"the faith which has been once and for all entrusted to the saints\" (Jude 1.3), as it has taken shape in the patristic tradition and the dogmatic confession of the Ecumenical Synods through the consensus of the Universal Church. Let us recall that at the end of the Holy Orthodox Liturgy, as a sign of unity and reconciliation, His Holiness Pope John Paul II and His Beatitude Teoctist, Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, exchanged gold chalices representing the desire to partake together of the Body and Blood of our Lord in the Holy Eucharist. The charism and responsibility of the Romanian Orthodox Church with that of the Universal Orthodox Church has been to keep and witness throughout history \"the faith which has been once and for all entrusted to the saints\" (Jude 1.3), as it has taken shape in the patristic tradition and the dogmatic confession of the Ecumenical Synods through the consensus of the Universal Church. The most interesting opinion was that of the archbishop of Cluj, His Eminence Bartholomew, who said: \"Christendom is taking its first great step toward the norm of the first millennium.\" The unity of the Church of Christ is founded on the communion of fullness because Orthodox ecclesiology is Trinitarian; it is also a theology of the communion of the Church which can be defined as a mystery of the communion of the Holy Trinity in the world. Allow me to quote a few excerpts from the official declarations of the spiritual leaders of both Churches: \"I wish to express my special gratitude to His Beatitude Patriarch Teoctist\" said His Holiness Pope John Paul II, \"for the brotherly expressions which you so kindly addressed to me and for your kind invitation to visit the Romanian Orthodox Church, the majority Church in Romania. Orthodox, Catholics and Protestants participated in this great event with great hopes for reconciliation, because the Romanian Orthodox Church has succeeded on this occasion in presenting the image of reconciliation in Christ. The Holy Sacraments are necessary for human salvation and there is unity of charism between faith and sacraments; when one receives the sacrament of Baptism, one becomes a member of the mystical body of Christ and of the Church. Nothing less than a resurrection from the dead!\" Reconciliation would be transmitted through the centuries to all peoples through his Church, his servants the bishops, the priests and the faithful. Do all you can to preserve the unity of the Spirit by the peace that binds you together (Ephesians 4.3)... The symbiosis between our language, of Latin origin, and the Orthodox faith which comes from our Church\u2019s identity, has constituted a strong link between West and East. That is why we are convinced that the energies of the Church must be directed toward common missionary and ecumenical work. In the following text, I will introduce briefly the question of unity and reconciliation, and I am convinced that the other brothers and sisters in Christ, present here, share the same vision on those two subjects. In the New Testament the word is used in the religious sense of reconciliation of man with God through Jesus Christ: \"We are filled with joyful trust in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have already gained our reconciliation\" (Romans 5.11). As for the relations between the Orthodox Church of Romania and the Roman Catholic Church, they have been excellent over the years. The result of this unity is a single faith. God offers gifts to the faithful in the Church in view of the unity of faith: \"In the Church, God has given the first place to apostles, the second to prophets, the third to teachers; after them, miracles, and after them the gift of healing; helpers, good leaders, those with many languages.\" Unity in the Holy Spirit is recommended by St. Paul so that peace and unity within the Church may be achieved. In spite of the doctrinal differences that have occurred between Christian Churches they remain united in Christ beyond denominational barriers. Unity in the Holy Spirit is recommended by St. Paul so that peace and unity within the Church may be achieved. Back to the present, the two sister churches, Roman Catholic and Orthodox, after the division of 1054, have worked toward reconciliation. The visit of His Holiness John Paul II to Romania has been looked upon very favourably by all members of the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church. In this context, let us only recall Ecumenical Patriarch Joachim III\u2019s encyclical of May 30, 1902 as well as the same patriarchate\u2019s synodal encyclical of May 18, 1921. Your Holiness, it is our conviction that our Lord Jesus Christ is among us and today\u2019s meeting is the will of the Father and the work of the Holy Spirit.\t\u041e\u0432\u0430

The Pope\u2019s historic visit to Bucharest, in a mainly Orthodox country, is part of the larger context of the dialogue between the Romanian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. Orthodoxy, as a member of the World Council of Churches in Geneva, has contributed significantly to the ecumenical movement founded on the Holy Trinity, i.e. the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Love of God and love of people complement each other and lead to unity, for as St. Paul says in I Corinthians 13: \"Love does not come to an end.\"... We also find a model of the unity and love of all Christians in the Holy Orthodox Liturgy, before witnessing to our faith in the Credo, when the priest exhorts the faithful to love one another: \"Let us love one another, so that with one mind we may profess\" to which the congregation responds: \"The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit - the Trinity, one in substance and undivided.\" The Romanian people showed great joy on the occasion of the Pope\u2019s visit to Bucharest. For the Orthodox Church, the problem of dialogue and reconciliation has been brought up especially after World War II, within the World Council of Churches, but at the Rhodes Conference in 1961 and at others that have taken place since, the two Churches, Roman Catholic and Orthodox, have decided to foster relations in an ecumenical spirit in the love of Christ. The Second Vatican Council affirmed for the first time the authority of the episcopal college and decided to initiate a theological dialogue between the two sister Churches on an equal footing. That is why we are convinced that the energies of the Church must be directed toward common missionary and ecumenical work.",

President Mahmoud Abbas, who attended the gathering in Cairo, said he remained committed to ending the Israeli occupation and establishing a Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem. The international community, including Germany's Foreign Ministry, called for an end to the violence and both sides to return to the negotiating table. Palestinians would be granted statehood in Gaza, scattered chunks of the West Bank and some neighborhoods on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The US has proposed to link these Palestinian sections through new network of roads, bridges and tunnels, while letting Israel control the state's borders and airspace, as well as maintain overall security authority. In 2010, US Middle East Envoy George Mitchell convinced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to and implement a 10-month moratorium on settlements in disputed territories. Since then, many of the attempts to establish peace in the region have referred to 242. Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo, Egypt to discuss US President Donald Trump's plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which was formally announced last week, have rejected the proposal. US President Bill Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to the retreat in July 2000 to discuss borders, security, settlements, refugees and Jerusalem. The pan-Arab bloc also said Israel should not implement the initiative by force. The negotiations in Norway between Israel and the PLO, the first direct meeting between the two parties, resulted in the Oslo I Accord. The failure to reach a consensus at Camp David was followed by renewed Palestinian uprising, the Second Intifada. \u2018A thousand no's' President Mahmoud Abbas, who attended the gathering in Cairo, said he remained committed to ending the Israeli occupation and establishing a Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem. Saudi Arabia and Egypt \u2014 close allies of the US \u2014 have maintained a neutral position on the plan, saying they appreciated Trump's efforts and calling for renewed negotiations. Trump's long-awaited proposal for Israeli-Palestinian peace would allow Israel to annex all its West Bank settlements, something that the Palestinians and most of the international community view as illegal. It also allows for the annexation of the Jordan Valley, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the West Bank. Since then, many of the attempts to establish peace in the region have referred to 242. Palestinians would be granted statehood in Gaza, scattered chunks of the West Bank and some neighborhoods on the outskirts of Jerusalem. It also allows for the annexation of the Jordan Valley, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the West Bank. Later the Arab League proposed the Arab Peace Initiative in Beirut in March 2002. Then US President Donald Trump's plan to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem prompted Palestinian leader Abbas to say \"the measures... undermine all peace efforts.\" A history of the Middle East peace process The Roadmap, 2003 The US, EU, Russia and the UN worked together as the Middle East Quartet to develop a road map to peace. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas took part in talks with officials from the Quartet and over a dozen Arab states. A ceasefire was reached between Israel and those in power in the Gaza Strip, which held until June 2014. The discussions involved Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinians \u2014 not from the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) \u2014 who met with Israeli negotiators for the first time. Hamas fired over 2,000 rockets at Israel, and Israeli military airstrikes razed buildings in the Gaza Strip. But Jordan, who has a peace treaty with Israel, warned against any Israeli \"annexation of Palestinian lands'' and reaffirmed its commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state that included all the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. A history of the Middle East peace process Diplomatic adviser to Abbas, Majdi al-Khaldi, had said the Cairo meeting's goal would be to issue a \"clear declaration'' rejecting the deal. \u2018A thousand no's' President Mahmoud Abbas, who attended the gathering in Cairo, said he remained committed to ending the Israeli occupation and establishing a Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem. A history of the Middle East peace process Trump's peace plan backfires, 2020 The plan called on Israel to withdraw to pre-1967 borders so that a Palestinian state could be set up in the West Bank and Gaza. Previously, the Palestinian leader was set to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi to discuss measures to \"protect the Palestinian people's rights,'' al-Khaldi added. A history of the Middle East peace process Deteriorating relations in 2017 Despite the year's optimistic opening, 2017 brought further stagnation in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In a communique, the Arab League said it would not cooperate with the US to execute the plan because it \"does not meet the minimum rights and aspirations of Palestinian people.\" The failure to reach a consensus at Camp David was followed by renewed Palestinian uprising, the Second Intifada. President Mahmoud Abbas, who attended the gathering in Cairo, said he remained committed to ending the Israeli occupation and establishing a Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem. It ended with a ceasefire on August 26, 2014. US President Donald Trump presented a peace plan that freezes Israeli settlement construction but retains Israeli control over most of the illegal settlements it has already built. The discussions involved Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinians \u2014 not from the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) \u2014 who met with Israeli negotiators for the first time. It also allows for the annexation of the Jordan Valley, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the West Bank. The plan would double Palestinian-controlled territory but asks Palestinians to cross a red line and accept the previously constructed West Bank settlements as Israeli territory. This picture from March 26, 1979, shows Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, his US counterpart Jimmy Carter and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin after signing the accords in Washington. The pan-Arab bloc also said Israel should not implement the initiative by force. The meeting at the Arab League headquarters came at the request of the Palestinians. \"The plan leads to a status that amounts to a one-state situation that comprises two classes of citizens, that is apartheid, in which the Palestinians will be second-class citizens, deprived of the basic rights of citizenship,\" Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said in Cairo. The negotiations in Norway between Israel and the PLO, the first direct meeting between the two parties, resulted in the Oslo I Accord.",

She added, it is obvious that Mr. Grouevski gives more importance to his sunbathing in Tel Aviv than the realization of the duties that he and all other colleagues are bound to carry out regarding the June 2 Agreement.. Political leaders then had agreed to leave behind their parties' interests and to start thinking about the good of the people and country. However, they forgot all of that in a week's time, and resumed wielding their political axes in the open once again: \" Gruevski evading responsibility by instigating violence\", \" Gruevski Thinks it is More Important to Get a Tan in Tel Aviv\", \" Hypocrisy at its best: Radmila Shekerinska has come out to criticize\", \" There is a bully in the Government\", \"The Government is ordering violence\", \"SDSM and their mercenaries will face the consequences\", \" There should be methods and techniques implemented that are used in similar cases in the western democracies\"... The use of strong \"diplomatic\" language continued.

DUI, responded that Taci is looking to score political points. They continuously push lies, manipulations and speculations in the public space, not only against politicians, but also against hundreds of artists, professors, professionals and even regular citizens. They are consciously causing a state of hate and violence\", the party in government claimed. VMRO-DPMNE responded to that by calling SDSM to take political responsibility for all of these cases because they are the ones who threaten with violence and who are spreading hate, lies and speculations. To this SDSM released another reaction: \"All institutions are in the hands of Nikola Gruevski. This is pure hypocrisy.\" After nine years in power does he still think he can free-ride on the story that others are at fault for the condition in which the country is in?\" Although Commissioner Johanes Hahn said this Monday that there is no time to waste and no time for the institutions to go on vacation, and that all should respect the agreed deadlines towards preparing the upcoming elections, the political parties pushed several press releases containing new and old insults. We facilitated the Agreement, but we can't facilitate everything- said Hahn after the meeting of the Council of ministers of the EU in Brussels. The brutal and undiplomatic attitude in the talks and negotiations between the Government and the opposition, which began in the residence of the EU in Przhino, is far from over. The two largest political parties from the Albanian bloc joined the exchange of fire. There is no convergence, rather, there is an intensification of animosity between the sides, which was noted also by Commissioner Hahn who mediated in Przhino.

This is an agreement that must be implemented in the name of the European future of your country. -We didn't agree on everything on June 2, but we hope the parties will find a way to agree.

Blood, hypocrisy, insults and pessimism: Where is the spirit of Przhino? Deputy President of SDSM, Radmila Shekerinska, said at a press conference that VMRO-DPMNE had cancelled the meeting half an hour before it commenced. This Monday should have seen the first meeting of the Action group that would have initiated the implementation of the Agreement from Przhino. DPA's leader Menduh Taci, after meeting today the Ambassador of OSCE, Marianne Berecz, expressed his pessimism that the Agreement signed in Przhino will ever be realized.",

I will support all the initiatives, and I am convinced that all the 120 MPs will do the same, regardless of its form - whether it is an initiative for amending certain laws, organizing a public debate, or any other form of parliamentary activity. We have gathered here for two reasons - the first reason is the \"Pearl of Wisdom\" award presented by the European Cervical Cancer Association. This is recognition of the activities and results of this Committee, but also acknowledgement for the level of parliamentarianism in Macedonia, which is not limited only to adoption of laws. Let me remind you that in 2007 and 2008 the Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Man, together with the NGOs, organised many public debates on this particular topic. At the same time, I congratulate all the other institutions receiving this award: the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Macedonia, the Women's Organisation from Sveti Nikole, the Regional Research Centre \"Studiorum\", and the Macedonian Women's Lobby, and I am convinced that we will all continue with the successful work for the benefit of all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia. As President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the competences deriving from the Rules of Procedure, I would like to convince you that I will continue to support every initiative that is in the function of organizing a more efficient fight against this illness. This award acknowledges the achievements of the Republic of Macedonia in the area of cervical cancer prevention. The ceremony of presentation of the award was held last month in the European Parliament in Brussels. As a Member of Parliament and as President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia I am very pleased that among all the other awarded institutions and NGOs from Macedonia, the Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Man of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia also received this award. Address by the President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Trajko Veljanoski on the occasion of receiving the Award \"Pearl of Wisdom\" from the European Cervical Cancer Association We have gathered here for two reasons - the first reason is the \"Pearl of Wisdom\" award presented by the European Cervical Cancer Association. I believe that these issues will be discussed during today's public debate organised by the Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Man and the NGO sector. This is a demonstration of the interaction between the executive which proposes the laws, and the Assembly, as the legislative authority, which in the process of adoption of the laws reviews and tries to improve these laws with amendments. As a Member of Parliament and as President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia I am very pleased that among all the other awarded institutions and NGOs from Macedonia, the Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Man of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia also received this award. The second reason why we are here, and essentially the most important one, is to say what we must do in the future. Address by the President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Trajko Veljanoski on the occasion of receiving the Award \"Pearl of Wisdom\" from the European Cervical Cancer Association The fight against cervical cancer is, above all, an issue of medicine as a science. All this resulted in amending the Law on Health Protection and obligatory free HPV vaccine. At the same time, I congratulate all the other institutions receiving this award: the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Macedonia, the Women's Organisation from Sveti Nikole, the Regional Research Centre \"Studiorum\", and the Macedonian Women's Lobby, and I am convinced that we will all continue with the successful work for the benefit of all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia.

This award acknowledges the achievements of the Republic of Macedonia in the area of cervical cancer prevention. The ceremony of presentation of the award was held last month in the European Parliament in Brussels. However, this terrible illness has another dimension, and that is the socio-economic dimension, felt not only by the patients but also by their families. I would also like to underline another dimension, and we have reached consensus when it comes to the laws on prevention regarding the health of the citizens, which demonstrates the responsibility of all the parliamentary parties.",

The participants were greeted by the Mayor of Stip, Sasko Nikolov, who emphasized that in his municipality more and more gender statistic data are applied, which are an important base for creating gender policies and support of the citizens in order to achieve gender equality at every level. Forum of Municipal Practices: Towards Gender-Responsive Municipalities was the topic of the conference held on June 25th, 2021, in Skopje, organized by ZELS. The project results, including the latest brochures that represent significant support for advancing communication between employees within the municipality and the municipality's communication with the external public in the area of gender-sensitive issues, were presented. It was pointed out that the experiences that each municipality gained in this area are a valuable source for further upgrading of knowledge in solving such challenges. Conference organized by ZELS - \"Forum of Municipal Practices: Towards Gender-Responsive Municipalities\" They expressed great gratitude to ZELS and UN Women for the overall support so far and pointed out that it should continue in the next period. This event completed the two-year period of implementation of the activities of the project \"Towards Gender-Responsive Municipalities: Strengthening Municipal Capacities for Gender Policies and Gender-Responsive Budget\", implemented by ZELS with the support of UN Women, Skopje, which is funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Swedish International Cooperation and Development Agency - SIDA. The coordinators from the municipalities of Kocani, Delcevo and Karpos, Ljubinka Ajtovska, Daniela Takeva and Violeta Cvetkovska spoke about the importance of advancing the communication of the coordinators for equal opportunities with all sectors in the municipality and with the external public and the media. Women mayors and mayors, women councillors and councillors from the Lobby Group for Gender Equality at ZELS, as well as coordinators and women coordinators for gender equality from the municipalities, discussed the challenges faced by the local government in building administrative capacity and creating and implementing different gender policies in segments of municipal competencies. She pointed out that in the past period the activities are generally based on the previously established Strategy for Gender Equality of ZELS (2018 -230) but also on the cooperation with UN Women. All pointed out that two-way communication is key to raising awareness of both municipal employees and the general public about the importance of gender issues. Good practices were presented by the coordinators from the municipalities of Centar, Aerodrom and Gorce Petrov, Drita Iseni, Vesna Markovska and Dance Vasilevska. The political commitment to this issue has improved, the capacities of the coordinators for equal opportunities have been raised to a high level, the inter-sectoral communication and cooperation in sensitizing the issues of gender equality within the municipalities has improved, and less and less programs are being adopted by councils, in which there is no involvement of the gender aspect.",

Proposal measures for narrowing the room for corruption in the illegal construction During the workshop, expert opinions were expressed by Vanja Mihajlova, Miroslav Grcev, Ph.D., and Miroslav Markovski, but their views were also shared by representatives from the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Macedonia, the State Anti \u2013 corruption Committee, the Municipality of Gjorce Petrov, the Association of Local Self \u2013 government Units, the City of Skopje, etc. The measures were suggested and discussed at the third workshop, which was organized by the Center during the month of September. On 2 October, the Center for Civil Communications submitted proposal measures for narrowing the room for corruption in the illegal construction to the authorized institutions and media in the country. The necessity of implementing the measures stems from the wide room for corruption in illegal construction and town planning, which is suggested by the thousands of illegal constructions, as well as the great percentage of apartment and office blocks among the illegal constructions, which supports the thesis of an illegal business rather than solving individual housing issues. The measures for narrowing the room for corruption in the illegal construction may be found in the reports section or here.",

Kazandol village is located close to the center of the concession. It is located within Vardar structural and tectonic zone and is composed of various gneiss, schist, marble and granite. Based on the current legislation of the Republic of Macedonia and signed contracts for detailed geological research, after the exploration and approval of ore reserves, the company Sardich MC will receive concessions for commercial exploitation of these deposits. \u2013 Au-Cu-Mo mineralization with heightened Re content, For the projects Sardich MC company has won the open bid of the Government of Macedonia and has acquired the right for detailed geological research of three potential copper deposits: Kazandol, Petroshnitsa, and Plavush. Genetically, it belongs to the copper-porphyry type. \u2013 Quartz-pyrite mineralization, \u2013 Optimal conditions for establishing production facilities Petroshnitsa concession is situated in the northeaster part of Macedonia. Its center is located 50 km north-east from Skopje, 23 km from Kumanovo, 22 km from Kratovo, 10 km from the border with Serbia. The area of the concession is confined to the contact of Serbian-Macedonian Massif and Vardar zone, directly to the Lecce-Halkidiki zone. Four lithological complexes participate in geological formation of concession (gneiss, schist, Furka granite, vein bodies of andesite and dacite-andesite). Kazandol concession is situated in the southeaster part of Macedonia, 5 km south from Valandovo, 7 km north from Bogdanci, and 15 km from the border with Greece. \u2013 Quartz-polymetallic mineralization. Ore mining will be carried out by open-pit method. Projects' geography: Kazandol deposit refers to exogenous hydrothermal type and is a typical \"iron hat\" that was formed by the impact of supergene processes on a linear quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite stockwork, the size of which has not yet been determined. Polymetallic mineralization in the form of veins and linear stockwork, as well as skarn mineralization at the contacts of granite and marble can be revealed within the concession. Projects Review Realization of projects for exploration, mining, processing of copper ore and production of copper cathodes with metal copper content of 99.99% started in 2013-2014. The area of the Petroshnitsa concession is characterized by a wide development of volcanic and subvolcanic rocks of the Late Paleogene with several ore parageneses:",

Albania has since seen a revival of Catholicism partly owing to the popularity of Mother Teresa, who had Albanian origins despite being born in what is now Macedonia. The 11-hour visit is part of the first European trip to be made by Francis, who became pope in March 2013. During his stay, the 77-year-old Argentine pontiff will meet Albanian President Bujar Nishani, celebrate mass in Mother Teresa square in Tirana, and meet with religious leaders, including those of the Muslim, Orthodox, Bektashi, Jewish and Protestant faiths. Albania has raised the police force alert to its highest level, with the Interior Ministry promising \"maximum\" protection by the deployment of 2,500 police and the setting up of 29 security checkpoints in the capital, Tirana. Some observers have voiced concerns that Pope Francis may have become a target for such attacks following his comments condemning the actions of the jihadist organization \"Islamic State\" (IS) and the Vatican's support for US air strikes against IS in Iraq to protect persecuted Christians there. Pope Francis arrived in Albania on Saturday on what is only the second papal visit to the country after Pope John Paul II travelled there in 1992, a year after communism in the Balkan nation collapsed.",

        "text":"So the healthiest products in the world are those that people can find without difficulty in their markets. Example: 1 small plate of boiled broccoli contains 123 mg vitamin C and 44 kilocalories. If the product is healthy and not tasty, people will not enjoy the health benefits it offers. On the other hand, when talking about the healthiest products, in addition to having a high concentration of vitamins, minerals, fibers, antioxidants, they should be unloaded with calories. Therefore the healthiest product must be rich and excellent taste. Must be easily accessible. They include dairy products, fish, lean meat and poultry. Must be known. You must have an affordable price and it is best to buy them when there is a season in the place where you live. Then they are the brightest and the highest quality. You pay the difference with extra 320 kilocalories. They should not be completely processed, should not contain synthetic, artificial or irradiated ingredients, and whenever possible be ecologically grown. Although there are many products of exceptional nutrition, many of them are not available in different parts of the world. If we divide 123 with 44 we will get a value of 2.8, which means that with each calorie of broccoli we get 2.8 mg vitamin C, ie for 60 mg vitamin C, we have to make 18 kcal of broccoli, which means that the broccoli has a high nutritional density. And finally, it must be delicious. Must be integral. In contrast to it, just like an example, we take the amount of vitamin C: 1 small plate of fried breadcrumbs onions, contains 200 kcal and less than 1 mg of vitamin C. To enter the required daily requirement of 60 mg vitamin C, you must eat 17 000 kcal. The product in its integral form is complex and contains nutritious products that synergistically improve our health. The healthiest products are never just vegetarian. which of them are the richest with vitamins, minerals, proteins, essential fatty acids, fibers and various phytonutrients that act as strong antioxidants. They must be rich in nutrients; it is not enough just to be rich and to promote health, but should be the richest source of nutrients in their group; in addition, they should have a scientifically proven influence that prevents certain chronic diseases . Always the same conclusions have been reached, the integral product has a greater effect than the supplement. Another example of vitamin E: you have to eat 5 pieces of white bread to bring in a quantity of vitamin E, contained in one piece of 100% whole bread. Ecologically grown products not only promote our health, they also encourage the health of our planet. In the almond cocktail itself there are flavonoids and they themselves increased the resistance of LDL to oxidation by 18%, while along with the vitamin E, which is in the heart of the almond, they increased the resistance to as much as 52.5%. How to be sure that we buy healthy products As an example we will consider the effects of the integral aldehyde on LDL (bad cholesterol). So far, people has not yet managed to invent a product that will contain all the nutrients in an ideal shape and ratio and which will be equal in synergistic action as a natural integral product. What are the criteria?",

        "text":"Social psychologists have managed to build a link between high levels of anxiety and the spread of fake news. Conspicuous rise of online media On the other hand, citizens should be careful when reading different media and, at the same time, develop the skills needed to identify potentially fake news and disinformation. Often, the victims of this disinformation were the conventional media with a lot of experience and consolidated staff. The blogs should be between 900 and 1300 words long, and written in concise and short paragraphs in an informal style. More precisely, 43.8% of respondents believed that the number of infected people in Kosovo is much higher than reported, while 31.9% of them believed that this number is lower than the real one. Therefore, in cases of a global pandemic, such as the one we are currently facing, it is very important to have accurate media reporting and proper transmission of data on the number of infected persons and death cases, and to correctly describe events by consistently respecting codes of ethics and professional principles. The fact that the virus was unknown at the time opened up countless opportunities for the emergence of many theories and hypotheses about its origin, how it was artificially \"created\" in a laboratory, its aggressively fast transmission in many countries, immediate and long-term consequences of infection. This is due to the fact that in times when a previously unknown event or phenomenon prevails, people will most likely rely on gossip, speculation and prejudice as a form of interpretation or explanation of the unknown phenomenon. But even though their intentions were varied - from spreading misinformation, causing panic, and even financial gain - it should be noted that fake news had significant consequences on people (most of those consequences persist), especially those of a psychological nature. There is no doubt that an important element in spreading this general panic was fake news, news built on semi-truths and disinformation that spread on social media. According to a study conducted at the University of California in the United States, after daily exposure to news on Covid-19, people are more likely to experience \"acute stress\" and \"depressive symptoms\". ), that became hotbeds of misinformation and fake news, using sensationalist and bombastic headlines, unsubstantiated information and texts, with no verifiable sources. This assumption has actually been confirmed by empirical studies. Given the massive use of social media both nationally and globally, such situations become very dangerous and potentially very detrimental to all the \"clients\" of this vast amount of information and, more dangerously, mixed with half-truths and \"fake news\", people get overwhelmed with more information than they can actually \"process\". Then, misinformation emanated from these same sources regarding the spread of the virus, the \"risk\" of getting vaccinated or the non-existence of the virus at all, etc. Consequently, repudiating the potential threat served as a \"defence mechanism\" to avoid the virus! It is common knowledge that fake news and misinformation can have different purposes such as: to attract readers and visitors on the websites that publish such news, financial benefits for certain people or even to meet certain social needs of different people or social groups. However, according to an empirical study conducted by two sociologists, it was found that in 60.9% of the citizens participating in this study the pandemic caused fear, (45.7%) panic, (34.8%) anxiety, and in 76, 3% social insecurity. Another disconcerting phenomenon, identified in other countries, as well as in Kosovo, is denying the existence of the virus. Only 24.2% were of the opinion that the number of cases reported by the relevant institutions is realistic. This insecurity and panic and even fear manifest themselves differently in different places. As information, speculation, and fear get mixed up and spread, it becomes difficult to find out the real and essential information about an issue. All this misinformation and fake news from unreliable sources was directed at the Kosovo public, which in many cases fell victim of these tactics and, with or without purpose, served as a \"tool of interlocution\" for further multiplication of this type of news on social media. Follow Us This website was developed within the project \"Connect the Dots: Improved Policies Through Civic Participation\", which is implemented by the Institute of Communication Studies. In Kosovo - especially in the first month of the pandemic - an impression was created that people would be left without sufficient basic food supplies and in a fit of panic they bought large reserves of flour, oil, sugar and other necessities. In addition, according to the Kosovo Agency of Statistics, comparing statistics provided by Eurostat, it turns out that in Kosovo, 93% of households have access to the Internet, while the average in European Union (EU) countries is 89%. According to a survey conducted in July 2020, 29% of Kosovars said they did not believe the Covid-19 virus existed at all, while 61.5% said the problem with the virus was overestimated, because they thought the virus was much less dangerous than it was portrayed by the media. On the other hand, it is now universally known that social media are the main means of spreading fake news, fallacies and misinformation. While over 33% of them used television as a source of information, 14.1% of the respondents used various portals. Negative psychological consequences According to a survey published in November 2020, over 51% of Kosovo citizens said that their main source of information during the pandemic - and especially during quarantine and curfew - was social media. This inevitably raises the odds for most Kosovars to use online resources, more precisely social media, as the main and most common source of periodic information about the virus and the developments regarding the pandemic. This type of news knew no borders, nor did they distinguish age, gender, even nationality. Based on data from specialized institutions, Kosovo has the highest average in the region in terms of Internet access. Currently, there are insufficient publications of scientific relevance in the case of Kosovo that may shed light on the multidimensional causal link between exposure to fake news and disinformation about the pandemic and the possible increase in stress levels or other psychological conditions. The responsible institutions in charge of monitoring the situation came to the conclusion that, since the identification of the first official case of Covid-19 in Kosovo, the number of portals or social media that aimed to irresponsibly exploit the health crisis has sharply risen. All of this should be done in order to \"immunize\" against fake news that is an integral and inevitable part of our daily lives, because projecting fear, insecurity and panic has direct and long-term consequences on the mental health of all of us. Practically, most of this information - especially online, not to mention some portals - contains disturbing speculation, conspiracy theories and baseless statements that confuse, disorient and intimidate citizens, causing anxiety, panic, stress, confusion, and even lack of concentration to face everyday problems. Denial of the virus as a \"defence mechanism\" Since the first case of infection was registered in Kosovo in March 2020, as was the case in many other parts of the world, the media have played an important role in raising awareness of the pandemic among citizens and in explaining the various forms of protection against the virus. Other researchers have conducted other relevant research on the relationship between various forms of disaster\/misfortune (be it man-made or natural) that people might experience and gossip, speculation, even fake news. Due to fear, anxiety, insecurity or the lockdown and curfew, we were all regular \"victims\" of such \"news\". It must be noted that, more or less, a similar situation could be seen in nearly every corner of the world - not excluding the countries of the region and Kosovo. Because of insecurity, people in the United States inexplicably scurried to buy large quantities of toilet paper. So, the large number of citizens with access to the Internet, combined with the massive use of social media and the situation with the pandemic, which was loaded with confusion and insecurity, has been an ideal and very \"fertile\" ground for \"creating\" and widely spreading fake news and misinformation. In contrast to this group, some participants in the study said they believed in the existence of the virus, but were sceptical about the number of infected cases - that is, did not believe in the numbers of infected people published by official institutions. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in China, one of the direct consequences has been the widespread and, in most cases, uncontrolled publication of fake news. I also believe that public institutions, especially educational institutions, should be engaged in organizing specialized lectures on the importance of media education, especially among young people and adolescents. Conspiracy theories and fake news spread faster than the virus itself. At the same time, however, along with the news about the virus, a significant number of fake news and misinformation about the virus began to appear, creating fear, panic, anxiety and social insecurity among people. It did not end there, another website, Cult Plus, projected and promoted a negative role of Bill Gates during the pandemic. According to the Digital Communication Network, during the pandemic (especially in the first half of the year) a growing trend was identified in the creation of dozens of websites, most of which presented themselves as news portals. The virus may be slowing, but fake news is still rampant The study also concludes that long-term exposure to pandemic news and contradictory data combined with \"secondary stressors\" such as job loss, pay cuts or lack of basic necessities for a normal life are elements and factors for the development of symptoms of mental health disorders. Z\u00ebri, a portal from Kosovo, published a story of fraud by a pharmaceutical company, co-founded by a Kosovo citizen, stating that he allegedly developed a promising treatment for Covid-19. The publication of news, including misinformation about the virus, was undoubtedly helpful in the creation of such an opinion and attitude.",

It prevents from water cooling during the night in the cold days. Also, it prevents from evaporation of the water and the means for water conditioning, with which provides better chemical structure and chemical stability of the water. The construction of the cover enables for one person to easily cover and uncover the swimming pool. However, the apparatus principle, not considering the model is very simple. Filtration Equipment The filtration equipment is for mechanical cleaning of the water. There are different modes, depending on edge details of the pool. There are different modes, depending on edge details of the pool. The strength of the filtration pump vacuum-cleans the dirt together with the water all the way to the filter, where the dirt is kept and the filtrated and cleaned water is returned to the pool. The most important is that they are made of firm construction, simple for implementation and later dismounting, and not to be slippery. WATER GAMES: The water games are hydro-technical elements and apparatus and with their exploitation, the family and the public pools are much enriched. It is easily implemented, especially if there is already a model for underwater reflectors set. For every type there is appropriate junction box. They consist handle and brush on which a tube is attached. On the other end, the tube is attached to skimmer or to a special vacuum cleaning connection. Swimming Pool Props Stairs, handles, showers; For this group of products it is very important that they are made of a quality material, especially if it is about products that will be under different outdoor influences. SWIMMING POOL CLEANING: Usage of Dolphin robots and vacuum cleaners. The hand-held brushes, the automatic brushes and vacuum cleaners are for removal of the dirt from the bottom of the pool. According to the usage, it is divided to filtration equipment for family swimming pools and filtration equipment for public swimming pools. UNDERWATER LIGHTENING The underwater lighting affects the aesthetic look of the swimming pool. It means building in the elements for the water circulation and its filtration; \u2022 FINAL PART OF THE BUILDING - setting plates or liner foil; \u2022 IMPLEMENTING PROPS - stairs, showers, equipment for lightening and sound, water games and jet apparatus; \u2022 MAINTENANCE, CLEANING, DISINFECTION: usage of disinfection means for maintaining clear and clean water and using of cleaners: Dolphin robots and vacuum cleaners; \u2022 PROTECTION COVERS Provides swimming in place, underwater massage and Jacuzzi effect. Protection Cover The special cover that lies on the water surface is with many functions: it provides water heating and it practically prolongs the swimming season. Beside the power of the pump, they also differ by the water top and by the material from which they are made of. BADU JET: Badu Jet System for fun, sport and recreation. The standard reflectors are from 300W\/12V. For every type there is appropriate junction box. It means building in the elements for the water circulation and its filtration; \u2022 FINAL PART OF THE BUILDING - setting plates or liner foil; \u2022 IMPLEMENTING PROPS - stairs, showers, equipment for lightening and sound, water games and jet apparatus; \u2022 MAINTENANCE, CLEANING, DISINFECTION: usage of disinfection means for maintaining clear and clean water and using of cleaners: Dolphin robots and vacuum cleaners; \u2022 PROTECTION COVERS \u2022 Hand-operated swimming pool cleaners; \u2022 Automatic swimming pool cleaners; Hand-operated swimming pool cleaners; Basically, they are used for cleaning the bottom of the swimming pool. STAIRS: They are necessary, in case they are not a part of the pool construction, as a concrete stairs or polyester pool stairs. BADU JET: Badu Jet System for fun, sport and recreation. Also, it prevents from evaporation of the water and the means for water conditioning, with which provides better chemical structure and chemical stability of the water. In this case, it is enough to dismount the reflector and on its place to build in underwater speaker with its cable and that would be all. WATER GAMES: The water games are hydro-technical elements and apparatus and with their exploitation, the family and the public pools are much enriched. UNDERWATER SOUND Music in unusual ambient - below the water surface, it becomes the most wanted part of the swimming pool equipment. Like in most of the cases, in this case, you would also need a professional advice, for which SANTEM-FF is at Your disposal. While calculating the capacity of the filtrating apparatus, the pool shape, the available swimming capacity and the water circulation elements are considered. By implementing the water games in the family pools, the size of the pool is compensated and the maintenance costs are rationalized. Elements For Water Circulation The elements for circulation are divided to two basic groups: \u2022 Vacuum apparatus that carry the water from the pool to the filters; \u2022 The exhaust elements that return the filtrated, conditioned water in the pool. The number of the water circulation elements and their setting depend on the depth, the shape of the pool and the power of the filtration apparatus. The hand-held brushes, the automatic brushes and vacuum cleaners are for removal of the dirt from the bottom of the pool. They are divided to automatic swimming pools with or without own propulsion and filters. The standard vacuum pump (18 mm) are with a flow rate of 2 -3m3\/h While calculating the capacity of the filtrating apparatus, the pool shape, the available swimming capacity and the water circulation elements are considered. Provides swimming in place, underwater massage and Jacuzzi effect. There are different models. The turning on, the turning off and the pressure setting is on the PH button, which is located on the mask. The basic principle for defining the needed capacity of this apparatus is for 12 hours of work, two to three hours to filter the whole water. The number of the water circulation elements and their setting depend on the depth, the shape of the pool and the power of the filtration apparatus. The presenting of the swimming pool equipment and technique starts with the basic built in elements and water filtration systems as minimum for successful maintaining of the water quality. In addition, there is equipment for circulation and warming, automatic dozers for chemical apparatus, and the equipment for underwater effects for the private and public swimming pools. UNDERWATER SOUND Music in unusual ambient - below the water surface, it becomes the most wanted part of the swimming pool equipment. It prevents the water from the dirt, mould and other dirty compounds. On the other end, the tube is attached to skimmer or to a special vacuum cleaning connection. Automatic swimming pool cleaners: The mutual characteristic of these apparatus is that in certain periods of time, independently, they start to clean the bottom of the swimming pool. \u2022 MECHANICAL PART: After you have chosen \"your\" future swimming pool, the first next step is to require a calculation from a team of experts about the water circulation as basics for the capacity of the mechanical part. In the concrete swimming pools, special housings are built in order to provide impermeability to water, while in the concrete swimming pools with PVC liners, reflectors with flanges are built in. The apparatus that provides flowing out and sucking in the water is located inside the built in element and the mask that are built in the pool. UNDERWATER LIGHTENING The underwater lighting affects the aesthetic look of the swimming pool. There are hand-operated underwater cleaners, which are included in the basic equipment, half-automatic and automatic underwater cleaners, which are included in the additional equipment. The goal of implementing the vacuum pumps is to move all water layers and to prevent creating of dead seaweed.

        "text":"An important thing to remember is that once the EnMS is implemented, the work does not stop at this point. After establishing scope and boundaries of the EnMS, the Commitment Phase usually consists of appointing a Management Representative and forming the Energy Team, with each member receiving clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The purpose was to ensure that both the public and the private sector will support the continuous improvement of energy performance, encourage competitiveness among businesses, and commit to using sustainable methods in order to improve energy efficiency. The Top Management needs to provide the necessary support in driving the programme forward and through it encourage the employees in active participation. The Planning phase conditions identifying and analysis of the Significant Energy Uses (SEUs) in order to define the Key Performance Indicators. An implemented EnMS represents a set of policies, procedures and business processes conducted under a methodological and organized approach in order to improve energy efficiency and ease the transition towards a low-carbon alternative in general. Once the SEUs are detected and documented, their influence analyzed, and the baseline established, the opportunities for improvement can be developed. At its core lie perpetual analysis, planning, implementation and checking. An integrated Energy Management System enables government institutions, organizations, businesses, public and private sector to effectively monitor and check their energy consumption, detect possible areas for energy savings and cost reduction. The company needs to commit to maintaining an energy policy which will give the frame for achieving the further-set objectives and targets. In order to introduce improvements in key sectors, an EnMS structure needs to be put in place to enable comparison between the \"old\" and \"new\" state. These recommendations are presented in the Training sessions, based on the developed Practical Guide and Tool. One of the key drivers is securing high commitment and dedication by the Top Management through a well-built business case. These aspects are usually discussed in four (4) modules \u2013 Commitment, Planning, Implementation and Checking. All necessary data is collected and analyzed in order to create the correlation between energy consumption and the variables. The introduction to an EnMS in line with ISO 50001 was done within the framework of the GEF-UNIDO project \"Catalyzing market transformation for industrial energy efficiency and accelerate investments in best available practices and technologies in Macedonia\" through several User and Expert Trainings. It represents a set of organizational and technical measures conducted in order to improve energy performance, based on continuous monitoring and dedication towards change in order to achieve long-term results. Willingness to improve through energy use-and-cost management as well as providing the staff with the necessary resources is a crucial step. Defined as a way of life, the EnMS encompasses several implementation aspects. The EnMS is a process of continual improvement, of continual monitoring, of continual changes in operational and maintenance practices, all playing an integral role even in daily life. A key aspect of the Energy Team's work is their ability to raise awareness on the importance of an EnMS, as well as to raise awareness on the possible areas for improvement in the company. These measures usually refer to simple changes in the operational or maintenance regime or adjustments in the existing equipment. The idea of introducing company representatives to the UNIDO Trainings comes from the fact that the international standard ISO 50001 does not define specific steps on how the EnMS should be implemented, despite it gaining importance since its first release in 2011. The implementation of an Energy Management System is based on a continual improvement cycle of Plan \u2013 Do \u2013 Check \u2013 Act, with the simple goal of energy and cost-savings, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint, and reducing exposure to energy price volatility. After the approved changes are implemented, the company conducts the Checking phase, during which it monitors the energy performance, determines whether energy savings are achieved, identifies any nonconformities and takes corrective and preventive actions. Experience has shown that these opportunities can be most diverse when the suggestions come from members of staff, facilities engineers, maintenance staff etc., i.e. input from all employees should be welcomed and evaluated. The drive towards implementing an Energy Management System, which most importantly, meets the requirements of ISO 50001, comes from the 2015 Paris Agreement (hyperlink, https:\/\/unfccc.int\/process-and-meetings\/the-paris-agreement\/the-paris-agreement), binding 195 countries to the global action plan of limiting the increase of global average temperature to well below 2 \u030aC. The Standard gives the framework in which an ISO 50001 aspiring company should determine the best available steps towards achieving an effective monitoring and management of its energy resources, in line with relevant legal obligations. In order to make this gap smaller, UNIDO's programme was designed to give specific recommendations to enterprises and institutions and help them achieve improvement in energy performance through practical methodology for meeting the company's energy-related targets and goals. One of the crucial elements of the EnMS is that the Implementation phase consists, first and foremost, of no- or low-cost measures.",

At the beginning of the match, they were playing tougher than us and used all their chances. The regular press conference was held right after the match HC Metalurg \u2013 HC Vardar. Although HC Metalurg is in a difficult situation, still they are a great team and it was difficult to play against Lino Cervar's tactics which was a tough defense line. In the second half, we played better in the defense, but the opponent's advantage was too high to reach. Filip Taleski: \"We were playing rather relaxed against HC Vardar at the beginning, and they knew how to use our weaknesses in the defense. However, the most important thing is that we have endured the 60 minutes and won the points that we had wanted.\" I know that a lot of players have left HC Metalurg, so we have had a better rotation than them, which decided for the victory.\" Then, few of our players got a bit tired, so I had to replace them to get some rest.",

When it comes to Gjurgjovden, Mr. Imer says, the tradition has always been about buying new clothes and proudly parading around the town in your newest outfit. Either way, we enjoy listening to all of the experiences that the elderly share with us, or in this case, the grandparents of children involved in our projects. The ones who can afford it, buy and roast lamb and share it with their neighbors who weren't privileged enough to buy one themselves. It's a tradition that has remained throughout time and works both for the citizens of Shuto Orizari (especially the children), and for the local clothes bazaar which is widely popular in the whole country.",

The species is edible, conspicuous, so it has been searched for in the past, and it has been frequently reported. Amanita caesarea is an ectomycorrhizal species, primarily with Quercus frainetto, Q. pubescens, Q. cerris, Q. coccifera, Q. petraea, and seldom with Fagus sylvatica, Castanea sativa and Carpinus orientalis in the country. The total number of sites is guesstimated to be up to 316 while the highest possible number of mature individuals is estimated at ca. 15 800. Conservation needed: At places of logging activities, instead of clear-cutting, trees of various age should be left on site. Macedonian journal of Ecology and Environment 15(2): 81-111. The species usually produces sporocarps from mid-spring to mid-autumn, and it is frequently noticed during warm and rainy seasons. The total number of sites is guesstimated to be maximum two times as high as the current number, resulting to be up to 316 sites. It has been found at 158 sites in the country, broadly dispersed in 50 biogeographic regions. Reforestation in the lower oak belt with alien tree species rather than oak should not be applied. Nevertheless, Amanita caesarea prospers in coppice forests and open areas; consequently, the type of forest management in the country has created a suitable habitat for dispersal and prospering of this species.

If you organize more events as the one today, then it is possible for Korean Government, companies and people to try to find new place for investment and I believe that Macedonia is a good place for realizing investments, Kim Shong Kong from the Korean Business Association pointed out. At the Business Forum, in addition to the introduction of low and flat taxes, investments in the education aimed at creating well educated workforce, and the benefits the technological and industrial development zones provide, Prime Minister pointed out the benefits from the Regulatory Guillotine Project, being positively assessed by the business sector. \u2013 It was important that Macedonian Government Delegation, headed by Prime Minister Gruevski, came here in South Korea for the first time to present the opportunities the Republic of Macedonia offers to businessmen from Korea, so as for them to get introduced with, to hear about the low taxes and the favourable business climate, about the opportunities to use Macedonia for entering the European market. Visit to the countries of the Asian continent will be completed with the visit to the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong of the People's Republic of China. Presented benefits were positively assessed by the present managers of Korean companies. It will take time since Macedonia is not known in Korea. \u2013 Tourism can be area of cooperation between the two countries, Kim Grace, Manager of the Tourist Company \"DG Tour\" from Seoul assessed, being interested in introducing Macedonia to Korean tourists. Great interest was shown by the present businessmen and we believe that therefore, they will pay visits to Macedonia in future, Stavreski said. Implemented reforms in Macedonia focused on business climate improvement, according to Gruevski, created conditions for effective operations of the companies. Skopje 2nd July 2014 (MIA) \u2013 Managers of Korean companies have positively assessed the benefits Macedonia offers for realizing foreign investments. Businessmen from Korea also support greater communication between both countries, as a guideline for establishing precise cooperation. Last year, Grace pointed out, Croatia was the most significant tourist destination for Koreans and many people pay visit thereto. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Zoran Stavreski believes that Korea is fast-growing economy and that that efforts should be made for presenting the benefits Macedonia offers to investors. Along with the Chambers of Commerce in the country and with around 300 companies of different sizes and from different sectors, we detected most of the problems the companies faced, mainly of bureaucratic nature, and we eliminated most of them, or we made them faster or cheaper, or a combination of both, being a significant improvement of the business climate in Macedonia, Prime Minister Gruevski said during his address, the Government Press Office announced. Korean companies with positive assessments for the investment opportunities in Macedonia Business Forum in Seoul, organized in cooperation with Financial Times Group is part of the activities of Government delegation in Korea, following their visit to Japan. Many Koreans may visit Macedonia as well, and I think that Macedonia is beautiful and warm country and I will put efforts for it to become tourist destination for Koreans, Kim Grace said.

The fulfilment of the Green Scenario, part of the Strategy for Energy Development of the Republic of North Macedonia until 2040, is definitely the most favored option for the country's energy future. By March, the contractor will be known and that currently three lines of the gas network are being built. He said that the production of coal must continue, but in order to be cleaner, by 2023 a complete reconstruction of filters of the 1st and 2nd block will be done, and by 2026 a complete desulfurization of the plant until a complete replacement with RSE.

Photovoltaic power stations will be built in the proximity to almost all of our capacities such as HEC Mavrovo and Tikvesh, REK Bitola, the wind park near Bogdanci will be expanded and a new one will be built near Miravci.\t\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u045c\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u043e \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0438, \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0425\u0415\u0426 \"\u041c\u0430\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\" \u0438 \"\u0422\u0438\u0445\u0432\u0435\u0448\", \u0420\u0415\u041a \"\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0430\"... \u045c\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a \u043a\u0430\u0458 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438, \u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432 \u045c\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0458 \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0438. REK Oslomej is an example of this where the building of a photovoltaic central with a capacity of 100 MW has been started. Vasko Kovachevski, ESM's Director, stressed that the state has clearly opted for the green scenario in accordance with EU standards, which will lower the emission of damaging gasses during the production of electricity. The investments for the accomplishments of projects for the transfer of electricity production from coal to sun and gas have been directed toward that goal. With the transformation of one block at REK Bitola into a power station run on sun and gas, with the capacity of 250 to 400 MW, electricity and heat energy will be produced for the needs of Novaci, Mogila, and Bitola,\" said Kovachevski. He said that the production of coal must continue, but in order to be cleaner, by 2023 a complete reconstruction of filters of the 1st and 2nd block will be done, and by 2026 a complete desulfurization of the plant until a complete replacement with RSE. All current and planned investments are directed towards these goals i.e. He repeated that the second phase of the HEC Chebren is underway where out of 10 offers for a water concession, 9 have passed the first phase and that this is a project that is worth 600 to 800 million EUR that will provide 300 MW of new energy into the system. The goal is to secure the stability of the electro-energy system,\" said Zaev. He repeated that the second phase of the HEC Chebren is underway where out of 10 offers for a water concession, 9 have passed the first phase and that this is a project that is worth 600 to 800 million EUR that will provide 300 MW of new energy into the system. At the moment, the building of 62.5 MW photovoltaic power stations is underway, with a private- state production, and concerning REK Oslomej, the second phase of the tender for building additional 2 photovoltaic power stations with an additional 100 MW is underway. REK Bitola will be transformed from the use of coal into using RSE, but this is a process that will occur in several phases and parallel in order not to disrupt the stability and the electricity production. With the transformation of one block at REK Bitola into a power station run on sun and gas, with the capacity of 250 to 400 MW, electricity and heat energy will be produced for the needs of Novaci, Mogila, and Bitola,\" said Kovachevski.

Vasko Kovachevski, ESM's Director, stressed that the state has clearly opted for the green scenario in accordance with EU standards, which will lower the emission of damaging gasses during the production of electricity. The investments for the accomplishments of projects for the transfer of electricity production from coal to sun and gas have been directed toward that goal. At the moment, the building of 62.5 MW photovoltaic power stations is underway, with a private- state production, and concerning REK Oslomej, the second phase of the tender for building additional 2 photovoltaic power stations with an additional 100 MW is underway. By March, the contractor will be known and that currently three lines of the gas network are being built. So far, 372 km of pipelines were built and by the end of the year, an additional 274 km of gas pipeline are planned to be built.

Photovoltaic power stations will be built in the proximity to almost all of our capacities such as HEC Mavrovo and Tikvesh, REK Bitola, the wind park near Bogdanci will be expanded and a new one will be built near Miravci.\t\u0421\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043c\u0435 10 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0458\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438. \u041c\u0415\u041f\u0421\u041e \u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041e\u0418\u0415 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0432\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0433\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435 \u0420\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438.\t0.076249\tp57s0\tp16s1+p16s2\td5ca7ded5662a97b\t74830667625221e9+d8d4b1176832ff13\t7bb23517b72b3627\t515.3\t0.449\nhttps:\/\/eprints.ugd.edu.mk\/23227\/\thttps:\/\/vistinomer.mk\/dui-strategija-za-razvoj-na-turizmot\/\tRecommendations for tourism development of rural areas in North Macedonia\t\u0414\u0423\u0418: \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0442\t0.243065\tp1s0\tp2s0\t268483546615f34e\td958081b3b50a604\t7bb236b374b31a43\t370.69\t0\nhttps:\/\/ip4all.com\/legislation\/law-on-copyright-and-related-rights-2003\/\thttp:\/\/ustavensud.mk\/?p=11479\tThe State duty shall be paid for the issuance of the certificate, and the relevant proceeds shall be transferred to the State budget of Ukraine.\t\u0417\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0431\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u043b\u0430, \u043e\u0431\u0432\u0440\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e, \u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430 0.3 \u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430.\t0.160040\tp204s1\tp87s4\t5993815135ba8a24\tf0e6e828d9a6dacb\t7bb23baeb8e43115\t499.54\t0.446\nhttps:\/\/www.dw.com\/en\/bundesliga-round-up-robert-lewandowski-stars-for-bayern-schalke-hold-bvb-in-derby\/a-36198292\thttps:\/\/time.mk\/cw\/c01581f050\/baern-so-petarda-ja-isprati-i-borusija-dortmund.html\tAmir Abrashi scoring a third for Freiburg to seal their first away win of the season.\t\u0415\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430 \u0414\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0434 \u0438\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0440 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442, \u0435 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430...\t0.121273\tp194s1\tp154s1\t2125b8645f790bf3\t68d67fb014a9c423\t7bb245115bb84869\t450.14\t0.443\nhttps:\/\/www.unicef.org\/coronavirus\/covid-19-and-masks-tips-families\thttps:\/\/www.unicef.org\/northmacedonia\/mk\/kovid-19-i-nosenjeto-maski\tIt\u2019s OK not to know all the answers \u2013 this is a new situation for all of us.\t\u0412\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0433\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438 - \u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441.\t0.809303\tp111s2\tp97s2\tf0716125e29746e1\t478a479e3ea297b7\t7bb2515c76624116\t561.13\t0\nhttps:\/\/www.pazar3.mk\/ads\/real-estate\/apartments\/q-BlackBerry\thttps:\/\/www.pazar3.mk\/oglasi\/elektronika\/mobilni-telefoni\/q-Blackberry\tHave a look at all of the ads based on your search: BlackBerry | All | Apartments | or register an ad now saying what it is that you buy or sell, and use all of the advantages that come by advertising on Pazar3.

The investments for the accomplishments of projects for the transfer of electricity production from coal to sun and gas have been directed toward that goal. The fulfilment of the Green Scenario, part of the Strategy for Energy Development of the Republic of North Macedonia until 2040, is definitely the most favored option for the country's energy future. At the same time, replacing coal with gas and other renewable energy sources (RES) i.e. the transition from coal to RES remains a strategic priority for the Government. He said that the production of coal must continue, but in order to be cleaner, by 2023 a complete reconstruction of filters of the 1st and 2nd block will be done, and by 2026 a complete desulfurization of the plant until a complete replacement with RSE. The adopted legal decisions are directed towards these goals, including the planned and current projects that are underway. This was stressed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev during the joint press conference with the Director of AD ESM Vasko Kovachevski and the Director of REK Bitola Zlatko Kjurchievski, in which the process of energy transition \u2013 from conventional sources into the production of RES, was presented. Vasko Kovachevski, ESM's Director, stressed that the state has clearly opted for the green scenario in accordance with EU standards, which will lower the emission of damaging gasses during the production of electricity. Main Section The Green Scenario and the investments in renewable energy remain North Macedonia's... the photovoltaic power stations, the replacement of one block at REK Bitola by 2026 with a photovoltaic power station and cogenerative gas power station, revitalization of the second block, and complete desulfurization and decarbonization of the process of electricity production. REK Bitola will be transformed from the use of coal into using RSE, but this is a process that will occur in several phases and parallel in order not to disrupt the stability and the electricity production. Its implementation will bring environmental and financial benefits including stability of the energy system. At the same time, replacing coal with gas and other renewable energy sources (RES) i.e. the transition from coal to RES remains a strategic priority for the Government.

By combining education, entertainment, and hands-on experience, students will grow their motivation and attraction to study engineering in their future. It's developing programs that encourage students thought, creativity, and innovation, which provide a tangible sense of success nurturing the students self-confidence, capacity, and inner focus of control. A world where greater information is accessible to anyone. In short, Young Engineers programs assist the students of today to recognize opportunities wherever they are, ones that come with every technological phase. Our goal is to lay the foundations for continuous economic growth and to provide employment for a new set of technology workers, who will enhance the level of innovation and expertise. Thousands of students from around the world have participated in our various enrichment programs successfully learning with our unique edutainment model. At Young Engineers, we believe that the most effective way to engage students and assist them in developing their skills of learning, analysis, and operation is by making learning fun and exciting.

It is a known fact that where there is competition based on education the result is growth and when one country grows, it has an economic global effect, so in theory, one student can change the world. We can. This challenge can be overcome only by students who develop their creativity, critical thinking, and research abilities, students who know how to create solutions for the challenges of a multi-disciplinary 21st century life and have a practical information to complete such a task. As information is easily accessible via the internet, filtering out the relevant information and processing that information becomes a complicated task. enables teachers to expose their students to various engineering principles, in a way that for every new engineering principle taught, previous engineering principles are better understood and being extensively in use, providing comprehensive engineering inter-discipline understanding.

Author: Dr. Simonida Kacarska The last quarter of 2019 has definitely been a peculiar period of the EU accession saga. This article is originally published in a Danish newspaper \"Magasinet Europa\". SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT: Mediate, do not hesitate (funded by the the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Skopje) Project lead: European Policy Institute (EPI) \u2013 Skopje Project partners: Academy for Judges and Public Prosecutors \"Pavel Shatev\" Chamber of Mediators of the Republic of North Macedonia Mediators Federation TEN In light of the decision by the Ministers of EU Affairs to give a green light to opening of EU accession negotiations with North Macedonia, we prepared an infographic on the preparedness of North Macedonia for starting the EU accession negotiations compared to the other Western Balkan countries. Analysis of the European Commission Report on the Republic of North Macedonia from 6 October 2020. However, these indicators are primarily focused on monitoring the output of envisaged activities, while dedicating little attention to the outcomes and the impact of the Strategy. The Action Plan for the implementation of the 2017-2022 Strategy for Reform of the Judicial Sector (the Strategy) has indicators, using which the success rate of the implementation of the measures set forth under the Strategy is assessed. This Report covers the following strategic goals set forth under the Strategy: quality, efficiency, transparency, strategic planning and policy-making, judicial institutions, criminal matters, misdemeanour matters and civil matters. The indicators do not cover the following strategic goals under the Strategy: independence and impartiality, liability, access to justice (with the exception of the Notaryship, enforcement and mediation), Judicial Council, Council of Public Prosecutors, and administrative matters. We are publishing the National PAR Monitor 2019\/2020, which systematically monitors the PAR. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed gaps in respecting the fundamental rights to health, education, employment and social protection across society. At the forefront of the pandemic were small businesses, people who were self-employed and creating jobs. How does the country stand in this field compared to other countries in #WB? Accession monitoring and advocacy: Performance Audit and Policy Evaluation: On the same or parallel tracks? How far is in implementing the #PAR? This project is financed from a Civica Mobilitas program, and will be implemented in a duration of 18 months. In addition, the indicators are concentrated to a great extent on the work of the justice system institutions, without taking due account of the influence the Strategy has on citizens. It includes one research partner or consortium from each member state of the European Union.

EPINET FRA is one of the decentralized agencies of the European Union and is the center of expertise for fundamental rights of the European Union. Informal network of young professionals who completed their postgraduate and doctoral studies outside the Republic of North Macedonia in EU related areas. EELN In The European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) has chosen the European Policy Institute \u2013 Skopje (EPI) as its partner from Macedonia to conduct research on issues of its competence. Though supportive of the opening of the accession negotiations, the position places new conditions on the Republic of North Macedonia, claiming that they derive from the 2017 Treaty on Friendship, Good Neighbourly Relations and Cooperation Between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria. Network 23 is composed of civil society organizations, which in their regular activities monitor and evaluate the policies of the Chapter 23 - Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, and advocate in these areas before the governmental institutions.

In certain areas of the EU acquis, the country is well ahead in terms of preparedness compared to other WB countries. North Macedonia is prepared for opening accession negotiations. The European Policy Institute \u2013 Skopje (EPI) started implementing the project \"Partnership Justitia: Regaining Citizens' Trust\", The overall objective of the project is to contribute to regaining citizens' trust in Macedonia's justice sector by meaningful civil society involvement in substantive reforms. This project aims to assess the impact of 2019 events, (Brexit, EU elections) over integration perspective of the WB countries and contribute to the process positively. In this analysis, we focus on the key aspects of the Enlargement Strategy which are related to North Macedonia as well as on the specific report for our country. Accession monitoring and advocacy: Evrozoom In November 2013, the Delegation of the European Union through the programe Broadcasting Eruope awarded grant or production of the new cycle of the show Evrozoom dedicated to the accession process of the Republic of Macedonia in EU. The project is consisted of several interconnected activities. Infographic: North Macedonia \u2013 Preparedness for EU membership in 2019 compared to other Western Balkan countries In partnership with the University of Utrecht,, Migration Policy Group \u0438 Human European Consultancy, as of January 2019, the European Policy Institute will participate in the work of the European Commission's network \u2013 'European Network of Legal Experts in Gender Equality and Non-discrimination' with Biljana Kotevska as its member.

To provide structured monitoring and comprehensive input to the implementation of the Furthermore, the Brief explores their possible impact, as well as the options for addressing the new challenges they pose for the EU accession of North Macedonia, focusing on the forthcoming negotiating framework, in view of the new enlargement methodology. The discussions Think for Europe Network (TEN) is a network of think-tanks from the six Western Balkan countries that work on EU accession. The findings on North Macedonia in these documents are particularly important in order to maintain and strengthen the case for actual start of negotiations with the holding of the first inter-governmental conference by the end of this year \u2013 according to the plan of the German Presidency. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a wave that no one could have predicted. This Report is based on the plan for monitoring the implementation and assessment of the results of the 2017-2022 Strategy for Reform of the Judicial Sector, using citizen-oriented indicators, i.e. Eight In December 2019, the EU granted support for the continuation of WeBER \u2013 the Western Balkans Enabling Project for Civil Society Monitoring of Public Administration Reform, a three-year project that was implemented from 2015 to 2018, funded by the European Union and co-funded by the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 20 years ago, the Republic of Macedonia, first among the countries in the region, signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union and its member states. In 1993, the \"Copenhagen criteria\", which set the conditions for EU aspirants, were defined by the EU Council, then headed by Danish prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (S). Photo by Mike Norton on Flickr Author: Simonida Kacarska 2020 has been a disastrous year for human rights in Europe, in the words of Dunja Mijatovic, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. The Project Partnership Justicia: Regaining the Citizens' Trust introduced citizen-oriented indicators for monitoring and assessing the implementation of the Strategy with a view to promoting the rule of law principle and prompting a greater human rights approach and focus with justice system institutions. It's telling that the most important milestones of the EU's enlargement policy are closely tied to Denmark. This document was followed by a Statement of the Bulgarian Government annexed to the Council conclusions of March 2020. The key findings from the second National PAR Monitor were presented for the National Working Group for public administration reform in North Macedonia. The European Policy Institute \u2013 Skopje published a policy brief analysing the Bulgarian conditions, compared to the bilateral Treaty. EC 2020 Report: Case for launching negotiations strengthened Some fifteen years ago, while talking to another veteran in the EU integration process from the region, I complained to At the forefront of the pandemic were small businesses, people who were self-employed and creating jobs. This report is the first one following the political decision of the EU for the start of negotiations with our country from May 2020. The Action Plan for the implementation of the 2017-2022 Strategy for Reform of the Judicial Sector (the Strategy) has indicators, using which the success rate of the implementation of the measures set forth under the Strategy is assessed. The deadlock of the October 2019 Council followed by the French non-paper for reforming the EU accession process prompted a much-needed debate on the possible ways forward in view of revising the enlargement methodology.",

And I cannot be with you \u2026 except honest \u2026 Metropolitan Naum of Strumica Does the word matter? I think that Saint Seraphim of Sarov had said: \u201cHumble yourself and thousands around you will humble themselves.\u201d Many people are dissatisfied with the state of affairs. Who will command with the Church, formally? Now, if most people want the change for the better, and there are not many who want to change themselves for the better, then how can we expect change for the better? Most often, people desiring these changes, begin with the best intentions; or at least they think the change they want is good. No, they will not, they are only spreading the wrong paradigm. And what do we Christians hope for without self-sacrifice and toil? Even if you have the best intention, you will not be able to. Consider, do you not see how much self-sacrifice even ordinary criminals do in order to achieve some individual benefit? Without personal sacrifice and exertion, one can neither change oneself nor the community in which one lives. This entry was posted by Macedon on Monday, January 4th, 2021 at 12:00 and is filed under \u0411ece\u0434\u0438. And not so much the changes in the Church as the change of at least one person in the Church. All this is important, but not decisive. Even the faith without deeds is dead. The ones who sacrificed everything that they had, and you still have and enjoy, even if he has not the best intention, even if he is with the premeditation to come to that position. Nothing good can come from it. That may not be true, but in this case, it does not matter. We see people who think that if they say something in public, without changing themselves, will cause some change. Everything is very simple \u2026 You want to sit at in a comfortable and warm home, well-fed and hydrated, together with your family, and you want essentially to command with the Church from there. It is possible for only one evil to be replaced by another evil \u2013 a greater one. Everyone wants such a state of affairs to change and many of them express their desire publicly; individually or in an organised manner. Changes in the society are not so much my topic as are the changes in the Church. From the quality of our own change depends the quality of the general change. Someone expressed this very well: \u201cEveryone wants change, but no one wants to change; that is, rarely does anyone want to change themselves; and yet, every change starts within ourselves. What do we see today? The state of affairs can affect them personally, it can affect the general public, as well as the whole of society. Goethe described this condition in the sentence: \u201cEveryone wants to be someone, no one wants to grow.\u201d",

They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, \u201cTeacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 23 But he continued, \u201cYou are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.(AB) 24 I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he,(AC) you will indeed die in your sins.\u201d 58 \u201cVery truly I tell you,\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cbefore Abraham was born,(BU) I am!\u201d(BV) 59 At this, they picked up stones to stone him,(BW) but Jesus hid himself,(BX) slipping away from the temple grounds. Has no one condemned you?\u201d Where I go, you cannot come.\u201d(AA) \u201cIf you were Abraham\u2019s children,\u201d(AT) said Jesus, \u201cthen you would[c] do what Abraham did. 40 As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me,(AU) a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God.(AV) Abraham did not do such things. 49 \u201cI am not possessed by a demon,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cbut I honor my Father and you dishonor me. 50 I am not seeking glory for myself;(BJ) but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. 27 They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. 2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.(B) 3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. John 8:39 Some early manuscripts \u201cIf you are Abraham\u2019s children,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cthen 54 Jesus replied, \u201cIf I glorify myself,(BN) my glory means nothing. (K) Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\u201d(L) 19 Then they asked him, \u201cWhere is your father?\u201d \u201cYou do not know me or my Father,\u201d(U) Jesus replied. 28 So Jesus said, \u201cWhen you have lifted up[a] the Son of Man,(AF) then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.(AG) 29 The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone,(AH) for I always do what pleases him.\u201d(AI) 30 Even as he spoke, many believed in him.(AJ) But he who sent me is trustworthy,(AD) and what I have heard from him I tell the world.\u201d(AE) 51 Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.\u201d(BK) 46 Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? \u201cIf you knew me, you would know my Father also.\u201d(V) 20 He spoke these words while teaching(W) in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put.(X) Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.(Y) But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. Therefore do what you have heard from the Father. Footnotes John 8:28 The Greek for lifted up also means exalted. (N) But you have no idea where I come from(O) or where I am going. 15 You judge by human standards;(P) I pass judgment on no one.(Q) 16 But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. Who do you think you are?\u201d 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \u201cLet any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone(F) at her.\u201d(G) 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. 47 Whoever belongs to God hears what God says.(BG) The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.\u201d 33 They answered him, \u201cWe are Abraham\u2019s descendants(AM) and have never been slaves of anyone. If I am telling the truth, why don\u2019t you believe me? 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham?(BM) He died, and so did the prophets. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.(BO) 55 Though you do not know him,(BP) I know him.(BQ) If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.(BR) 56 Your father Abraham(BS) rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it(BT) and was glad.\u201d 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. 14 Jesus answered, \u201cEven if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. 21 Once more Jesus said to them, \u201cI am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die(Z) in your sin. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me,(AQ) because you have no room for my word. 32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\u201d(AL) 9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 12 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \u201cI am(J) the light of the world. [b]\u201d(AS) 48 The Jews answered him, \u201cAren\u2019t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan(BH) and demon-possessed?\u201d(BI) 42 Jesus said to them, \u201cIf God were your Father, you would love me,(AY) for I have come here from God.(AZ) I have not come on my own;(BA) God sent me.(BB) 43 Why is my language not clear to you? 34 Jesus replied, \u201cVery truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.(AN) 35 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.(AO) 36 So if the Son sets you free,(AP) you will be free indeed. 31 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \u201cIf you hold to my teaching,(AK) you are really my disciples. 57 \u201cYou are not yet fifty years old,\u201d they said to him, \u201cand you have seen Abraham!\u201d (C) Now what do you say?\u201d 26 \u201cI have much to say in judgment of you. I stand with the Father, who sent me.(R) 17 In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.(S) 18 I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.\u201d(T) 38 I am telling you what I have seen in the Father\u2019s presence,(AR) and you are doing what you have heard from your father. 44 You belong to your father, the devil,(BC) and you want to carry out your father\u2019s desires.(BD) He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.(BE) 45 Yet because I tell the truth,(BF) you do not believe me! 25 \u201cWho are you?\u201d they asked. \u201cJust what I have been telling you from the beginning,\u201d Jesus replied.

        "text":"Skopje, 6th January 2014 (MIA) \u2013 The Government has given one more last chance to the citizens to purchase courtyard lots at the price of EUR 1 per square meter in the next nine months. Why did you decide to undertake this step? What happens after the expiry of this deadline? Suzi Koteva Stoimenova Also available in: All this will provide for growth intensification and improvement of economic trends of companies in 2014, thus contributing to better living standards of Macedonian citizens. Citizens will be again able to purchase the courtyard lost at the price of one euro per square meter starting January, i.e. following the entry into force of the law within the next 9-month period. This year, i.e. in about two months construction of two motorways from Skopje to Stip and from Kicevo to Ohrid should start. Perhaps the expression \"2014 will be a year of major infrastructure projects\" is too much used, however, it best describes the investment plans of the Government in the coming year. I would like to recommend to all citizens that the New Year's drawing, during which flat, shop, Peugeot 28 were awarded, is only a start of one big prize game, which will last throughout the year, with drawings scheduled each month, in which all citizens will have a chance to participate. 2014 Budget will provide for more intensified economic growth by realizing capital investments, which are by 11% higher compared to last year. For instance, as for the already existing investments, Johnson Controls Skopje has announced 500 jobs, 325 out of which being realized so far, Johnston Controls Stip has announced 1,500 jobs, 768 out of which have been already created, Johnson Metti has announced 650 and created 448 jobs, Kemet Electronic has announced 500 and created 177 jobs, Protek has announced 130 and created 50 jobs, Teknohose has announced 170 and created 32 jobs, Van Hool has announced 500 and created 250 jobs Kromberg and Schubert have announced 3,000 and created 792 jobs, Drexel Meyer has announced 4,000, 1048 out of which have been created, Alliance One has announced 150 jobs, 138 out of which have been already created, Kumal in Stip has announced 50 jobs, Kofikab Kavadarci has announced 150 jobs, Markart Veles has announced 500 new jobs. These projects will provide for work to the Macedonian companies, and new jobs for Macedonian citizens. Those who will not privatize the land following the expiry of this deadline will have to conclude a lease agreement. I would like to point out that all possible concessions have been made so far. However, the interest is actually even greater. The deadline for purchasing courtyard lots was extended twice, the price is symbolic \u2013 one euro per square meter, and we will additionally simplify the purchase-related procedures under the new legal changes, i.e. new possibility will be given for privatizing the land on which the facility is located in cases when there is not adopted detailed urban plan or another act, defining the construction lot. Additional incentive are the low interest rate on the subsidized Government loans. After the expiry of the previous deadline, t over 1970 cases for land purchase were submitted, however the interest is actually even greater. Road construction will stimulate the construction industry. Citizens will be again able to purchase the courtyard lost at the price of one euro per square meter starting January, i.e. following the entry into force of the law within the next 9-month period. Each fiscal receipt provides the possibility for building more schools, hospitals, roads, pensions increase, more funds for farmers and everything else financed by the Budget. For instance, as for the \"installment\" model, where the Government subsidizes either 50% or 75% of the installment, the interest rate amounts to 4.99% for the first three years, while it accounts for 5.5% in the fourth and fifth year. Will flats and houses be bought with Government subsidies in 2014? What will the Government invest in during 2014? Total investments in capital projects this year will amount to over half a billion euros or more precisely EUR 525 million, if the investments from the budget of the Public Enterprise for State Roads are taken into account. 4,028 new jobs were created in the free economic zones,, 5,798 new jobs were created through self-employment on the basis active policies of the Employment Agency, 4,807 new jobs were created by subsidizing the employers through the Employment Agency, 6,591 were created jobs through the training by a renowned employer, internship created 759 jobs, personal business education created 1,914 jobs, and 4,907 jobs were created through the credit line for small and medium-sized enterprises, the Government provided from EIB. To be real, buying a flat or a house is not an impulsive decision \u2013 such decision is made only several times in your lifetime so I would say that it is a matter of vital issue. As trends on the capital market develop \u2013supply increase indicates drop in the prices, and as time passes in terms of the project realization, number of loan users will be even higher and the interest will gain intensity. In addition two large projects in the health sector will also be commenced- construction of both the Clinical Center in Skopje and the Clinical Hospital in Stip. So far, what are the impressions, does this prize game achieve the results you expected? In general, what are the economic perspectives for this year? Capital and infrastructure projects to be financed with Budget funds will even accelerate the economic activity. Following the recovery of industry in 2013, this year, moderate intensification of industrial production is envisaged, which is project to experience 3.8% growth, mainly as a result of the expected dynamics for foreign demand growth. In conditions of gradual restoring of confidence and optimism of consumers and investors, it is expected for the EU to realize more intensified economic growth, projected at 1.4%. If they fail to purchase the courtyard lots within this deadline, they will have to sign land lease agreement. So new jobs are created in Macedonia, when most of the countries, under the influence of the global economic crisis, laid off workers. When meeting the citizens, the question of whether they would be provided one more last chance to purchase courtyard lots was one of the most frequently asked. In 2014, construction of Boskov Most and Lukovo Pole Hydro Power Plants and the primary gas network will commence, while this month, public call for concession of the secondary gasification will be launched. First drawing of the prize game \"Fiscal receipts in hand \u2013 rewards without hassle\" was realized, the prize game will continue during 2014 as well. In addition, during 2014, it is expected for around 20 companies to arrive, which will create several thousands of jobs. So far, 228 families have resolved their housing issue through this Project which would roughly mean around 1,000 people, however the expectations from this Project are much greater. All fiscal receipts as of 15th November 2013 onwards are in still frame for the prize game and the deadline for sending the receipts for the next drawing is 26th January by 24:00 o'clock at the latest. As a result of only three measures this Government has undertaken, total of 39,450 new jobs have been created. So we are talking about 11,800 new jobs stemming from the existing investments in the zones, 4,028 out of which have already been created. Skopje, 6th January 2014 (MIA) \u2013 The Government has given one more last chance to the citizens to purchase courtyard lots at the price of EUR 1 per square meter in the next nine months. I would like to point out that all possible concessions have been made so far. Economic trends at companies will be also underpinned by the new tranche from the European Investment Bank, amounting to EUR 100 million that will be available to the companies as of January. Citizens are stimulated, and at the same time they feel that they are doing something that is beneficial for the whole society. In favour of the citizens, we decided to provide them that last chance so as to regulate their property issues. Government has provided additional nine months for purchase of courtyard lots. Government subsidy, which may amount up to EUR 10,000 for buying a flat or up to EUR 15,000 for buying a house, and which is a conditional grant is certainly an incentive. Therefore I appeal to the citizens to collect fiscal receipts and to send them to the already well known address of the State Lottery. Buy a House, Buy a Flat Project continues in 2014 as well. I would like to also underline that all envelopes that will not be winning during this drawing, will participate in the drawing for the shop and the flat on 31st June. I would say much to the delight of many citizens, because, since as time passes in terms of the project realization, more and more people perceive and use the benefits from this Project. Expectations of the Ministry of Finance about the prize game are surpassed. It is still high, however, compared to the extremely high unemployment of around 38% we inherited from the previous Government, the reduction to the present 28.7%, or by almost ten percentage points was the maximum we could do in troubled times during a five and a half-year period of global and European crises. Flat, shop and a car have been already awarded, as well as a number of valuable vouchers. Culture of issuing and requiring fiscal receipts by traders and citizens is created and the awareness is raised about this being the usual way of fulfilling the obligations and helping the development of the local regions and the country as a whole. The deadline for purchasing courtyard lots was extended twice, the price is symbolic \u2013 one euro per square meter, and we will additionally simplify the purchase-related procedures under the new legal changes, i.e. new possibility will be given for privatizing the land on which the facility is located in cases when there is not adopted detailed urban plan or another act, defining the construction lot. Home Interview MIA: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Zoran Stavreski As for the \"participation\" model, where the Government subsidizes either 50% or 75% of the participation in the housing loan, the interest rate amounts to 4.5% plus EURIBOR throughout the repayment period, being definitely the lowest interest rate on the market at present. In addition to capital investments, as generator of new jobs, what do you see to be the perspective for resolving this issue? Agreement on construction of railway line to Bulgaria was also signed, where the construction activities should commence in the next two to three months, and the railroad tracks along Corridor X will be repaired. When is the next drawing scheduled for and what will the prize fund consist of? The main prize is Polo Trendline car, and the rich prize fund including 150 valuable vouchers from Denar 1,000 to Denar 60,000 for household appliances, audio visual equipments, bikes, food products and many other prizes still remains. This year, the strengthening of European economy is expected to continue, as well as the economy of the EU, which is the most significant trade partner of Macedonia. Those who will not privatize the land following the expiry of this deadline will have to conclude a lease agreement. Lease fee will be determined, 20% out of which will be allocated to the budget, and 80% will be allocated to the municipality where the land is located. Interview MIA: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Zoran Stavreski The citizens are just to collect fiscal receipts and send them to the State Lottery. When is the next drawing scheduled for and what will the prize fund consist of? Next drawing is already scheduled at the end of January. On the basis of interest rates alone, citizens who will apply for this Project will save from EUR 2,000 to EUR 3,000. Following the expiry of the previous deadline for purchase of courtyard lots, i.e. December 2012, another 1,970 cases for purchase courtyard lots were submitted, i.e. that is the number of people who, after the expiry of the deadline, turned to the Property and Legal Affairs Office, so as to regulate their property right to the land they use. Capital and infrastructure projects to be financed with Budget funds will even accelerate the economic activity. Last year, Law on Financial Discipline was adopted, which will also contribute to improving the liquidity of companies. Buy a House, Buy a Flat Project is even more present in the household budget of citizens. Unemployment still remains a burning issue the Government will continue to address in future as well. We see the economic growth in the country, at the same time the arrival of foreign companies, which are major job creators as a perspective for this resolving this issue. Every citizen should know that by requiring fiscal receipt he\/she is provided with the possibility to support the construction of a facility, procurement of medical equipment, improvement of public sector services, and to support, in general, everything that will contribute to better life of the citizens in the Republic of Macedonia. This year, the strengthening of European economy is expected to continue, as well as the economy of the EU, which is the most significant trade partner of Macedonia. Growth of the economy last year contributed to further unemployment reduction.",

Instead of cooperation and common witness before the world for its salvation \u2013 war and witness to one's own passions of the love of glory and power, scandalizing Christ's least brothers. In the words of the Apostle of the Gentiles, we greet all of you: \"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ\" (2 Cor 1:2). Our traditions represent for us a patrimony which must be continually shared, proposed, and interpreted anew. This fraternal encounter which brings us together, Pope Benedict XVI of Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, is God's work, and in a certain sense his gift. We have not yet drawn from this act all the positive consequences which can flow from it in our progress towards full unity, to which the mixed Commission is called to make an important contribution. This commitment comes from the Lord's will and from our responsibility as Pastors in the Church of Christ. We fervently hope that peace will be re-established in that region, that respectful coexistence will be strengthened between the different peoples that live there, between the Churches and between the different religions found there. To this end, we encourage the establishment of closer relationships between Christians, and of an authentic and honest interreligious dialogue, with a view to combating every form of violence and discrimination. This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it! We take profoundly to heart the cause of peace in the Middle East, where our Lord lived, suffered, died and rose again, and where a great multitude of our Christian brethren have lived for centuries. Instead of greeting all other Christians and assuring them of your openness to dialogue and cooperation, you could first try meeting at least for half an hour the Archbishop of Ohrid and Macedonia \u2013 your Orthodox brother and a fellow worker in the field of God, the head of the Orthodox Church in the Republic of Macedonia \u2013 and then we will start believing you. Our concern extends to those parts of today's world where Christians live and to the difficulties they have to face, particularly poverty, wars and terrorism, but equally to various forms of exploitation of the poor, of migrants, women and children. We have viewed positively the process that has led to the formation of the European Union. In Europe, while remaining open to other religions and to their cultural contributions, we must unite our efforts to preserve Christian roots, traditions and values, to ensure respect for history, and thus to contribute to the European culture of the future and to the quality of human relations at every level. In Christ we greet other Christians, assuring them of our prayers and our openness to dialogue and cooperation. We must all commit ourselves to the renewed service of humanity and the defense of human life, every human life. Those engaged in this great project should not fail to take into consideration all aspects affecting the inalienable rights of the human person, especially religious freedom, a witness and guarantor of respect for all other freedoms. Our theological and ethical traditions can offer a solid basis for a united approach in preaching and action. Common Declaration by Pope Benedict XVI and Patriarch Bartholomew I How wonderful is the common declaration by Pope Benedict XVI and Patriarch Bartholomew I, man may say under the influence of its first reading. As far as relations between the Church of Rome and the Church of Constantinople are concerned, we cannot fail to recall the solemn ecclesial act effacing the memory of the ancient anathemas which for centuries had a negative effect on our Churches. Then we shall truly be able to rejoice and be glad. As religious leaders, we consider it one of our duties to encourage and to support all efforts made to protect God's creation, and to bequeath to future generations a world in which they will be able to live. We exhort our faithful to take an active part in this process, through prayer and through significant gestures. This has brought together our Churches in the declared aim of re-establishing full communion. In the words of the Apostle of the Gentiles, we greet all of you: \"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ\" (2 Cor 1:2). Instead of effacing the ancient anathemas, readiness to pronounce new ones. In Europe, while remaining open to other religions and to their cultural contributions, we must unite our efforts to preserve Christian roots, traditions and values, to ensure respect for history, and thus to contribute to the European culture of the future and to the quality of human relations at every level. This fraternal encounter which brings us together, Pope Benedict XVI of Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, is God's work, and in a certain sense his gift. We have recalled with thankfulness the meetings of our venerable predecessors, blessed by the Lord, who showed the world the urgent need for unity and traced sure paths for attaining it, through dialogue, prayer and the daily life of the Church. Instead of respect for the minorities, their cultural traditions, as well as the rights of every human being, created in the image and likeness of God, and its religious freedom \u2013 denial of a whole nation and its cultural tradition, trampling and spitting upon Christ's image in every Macedonian. However, if he ponders a bit, he will see that many of the positive messages of this declaration are not valid for its Orthodox signers when it comes to the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Macedonian nation, and the Macedonian man. As Pastors, we have first of all reflected on the mission to proclaim the Gospel in today's world. In every step towards unification, minorities must be protected, with their cultural traditions and the distinguishing features of their religion. Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras I went as pilgrims to Jerusalem, to the very place where Jesus Christ died and rose again for the salvation of the world, and they also met again, here in the Phanar and in Rome. We are committed to offer unceasing support, as in the past, to the work entrusted to this Commission and we accompany its members with our prayers. Finally, our thoughts turn towards all of you, the faithful of our two Churches throughout the world, Bishops, priests, deacons, men and women religious, lay men and women engaged in ecclesial service, and all the baptized. They left us a common declaration which retains all its value; it emphasizes that true dialogue in charity must sustain and inspire all relations between individuals and between Churches, that it \"must be rooted in a total fidelity to the one Lord Jesus Christ and in mutual respect for their own traditions\" (Tomos Agapis, 195). All this calls for a renewed and powerful proclamation of the Gospel, adapted to the cultures of our time. The Holy Spirit will help us to prepare the great day of the re-establishment of full unity, whenever and however God wills it. Instead of a meeting in prayer and in dialogue towards full communion, we are witnesses of parting in thoughts and in monologue towards destruction of the church community. This will permit us to address some of the principal questions that are still unresolved. Above all, we wish to affirm that killing innocent people in God's name is an offence against him and against human dignity. May our meeting be a sign and an encouragement to us to share the same sentiments and the same attitudes of fraternity, cooperation and communion in charity and truth. Moreover, we cannot ignore the increase of secularization, relativism, even nihilism, especially in the Western world. This link, which has contributed so much to the Christian heritage that we share, remains timely and will bear more fruit in the future for evangelization and for our unity. This had been interrupted for several years because of various difficulties, but now the Commission was able to work afresh in a spirit of friendship and cooperation. The Holy Spirit will help us to prepare the great day of the re-establishment of full unity, whenever and however God wills it. This mission, \"Go, make disciples of all nations\" (Mt 28:19), is today more timely and necessary than ever, even in traditionally Christian countries. In treating the topic \"Conciliarity and Authority in the Church\" at local, regional and universal levels, the Commission undertook a phase of study on the ecclesiological and canonical consequences of the sacramental nature of the Church. We have not yet drawn from this act all the positive consequences which can flow from it in our progress towards full unity, to which the mixed Commission is called to make an important contribution. This had been interrupted for several years because of various difficulties, but now the Commission was able to work afresh in a spirit of friendship and cooperation. We give thanks to the Author of all that is good, who allows us once again, in prayer and in dialogue, to express the joy we feel as brothers and to renew our commitment to move towards full communion. We must all commit ourselves to the renewed service of humanity and the defense of human life, every human life. We are called to work together to promote respect for the rights of every human being, created in the image and likeness of God, and to foster economic, social and cultural development. At present, in the face of the great threats to the natural environment, we want to express our concern at the negative consequences for humanity and for the whole of creation which can result from economic and technological progress that does not know its limits. At the time of the plenary session of the mixed Commission for theological dialogue, which was recently held in Belgrade through the generous hospitality of the Serbian Orthodox Church, we expressed our profound joy at the resumption of the theological dialogue. In this context, how could we not evoke the very ancient witnesses and the illustrious Christian heritage of the land in which our meeting is taking place, beginning with what the Acts of the Apostles tells us concerning the figure of Saint Paul, Apostle of the Gentiles? At present, in the face of the great threats to the natural environment, we want to express our concern at the negative consequences for humanity and for the whole of creation which can result from economic and technological progress that does not know its limits. Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras I went as pilgrims to Jerusalem, to the very place where Jesus Christ died and rose again for the salvation of the world, and they also met again, here in the Phanar and in Rome. Instead of resumption of the theological dialogue, its stalling and obstruction. We are called to work together to promote respect for the rights of every human being, created in the image and likeness of God, and to foster economic, social and cultural development. We take profoundly to heart the cause of peace in the Middle East, where our Lord lived, suffered, died and rose again, and where a great multitude of our Christian brethren have lived for centuries. In this land, the Gospel message and the ancient cultural tradition met. Moreover, we cannot ignore the increase of secularization, relativism, even nihilism, especially in the Western world. Nor have we forgotten the reciprocal visits of His Holiness Pope John Paul II and His Holiness Dimitrios I. It was during the visit of Pope John Paul II, his first ecumenical visit, that the creation of the Mixed Commission for theological dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church was announced. This has brought together our Churches in the declared aim of re-establishing full communion. As far as relations between the Church of Rome and the Church of Constantinople are concerned, we cannot fail to recall the solemn ecclesial act effacing the memory of the ancient anathemas which for centuries had a negative effect on our Churches. In treating the topic \"Conciliarity and Authority in the Church\" at local, regional and universal levels, the Commission undertook a phase of study on the ecclesiological and canonical consequences of the sacramental nature of the Church. We exhort our faithful to take an active part in this process, through prayer and through significant gestures.",

Received: 07.07.2016 Accepted: 16.07.2016 Review Article Intellectual disability is a lifelong debilitating developmental disorder with important genetic contribution, which remains challenging to investigate due to high clinical and genetic variability. New diagnostic tools in genetics such as array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have much higher detection rate for genetic aberrations responsible for ID and have enormous potential to shorten the path to diagnosis, as early diagnosis is a cornerstone for medical and non-medical management of persons suffering from ID.

Furthermore, it is regulated that the supervision over the performance of the activity within the construction land envisaged by the urban plan or urban planning documentation for a beach be carried out by the State Market Inspectorate and Public Revenue Office, and the failure on the part of the lessee to act is a ground for the State Market Inspectorate to close down the facilities. Two new Articles 2-a and 2-b are added following Article 2 in the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.90\/2020), which shall read: \"Article 2-a The Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 16 February 2020, adopted a Decision on the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.43\/20120). In the part of the Constitution which refers to \"Defence of the Republic, state of war and state of emergency\", Article 125 stipulates: \"State of emergency occurs when major natural disasters or epidemics occur (paragraph 1); The existence of a state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia or its part is determined by the Assembly upon the proposal of the President of the Republic, the Government or at least 30 Representatives (paragraph 2); The decision determining the existence of a state of emergency is made by a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives and is valid for a maximum of 30 days (paragraph 3); If the Assembly cannot convene, the President of the Republic decides on the existence of a state of emergency and submits it to the Assembly for confirmation as soon as it is able to convene (paragraph 4). Hence, in the conditions of a contagious disease and the existence of a general danger of infecting the population, generally the measures with the decrees with legal force should refer to the restrictions of rights and obligations that are necessary for the protection of the public interest.

Two new Articles 2-a and 2-b are added following Article 2 in the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.90\/2020), which shall read: This is because the Constitution clearly stipulates that when the Assembly is unable to meet, the President of the Republic may declare a state of emergency, that the decision to declare it is submitted for confirmation to the Assembly as soon as it can meet. The issue of enacting decrees with legal force in conditions of a state of emergency is related to the state of emergency and such authority is given to the Government undisputably by the Constitution. The issue from a constitutional-legal character if the Government has the authority to adopt decrees with legal force is not disputable since the Constitution grants such authority and there is a constitutional ground for that, especially since in the concept of the Constitution the Government remains on duty until the election of a new government even when its mandate has terminated due to the dissolution of the Assembly (Article 93 paragraph 5 of the Constitution) and the Assembly is dissolved if the majority of the total number of Representatives in the Assembly agrees (Article 63 paragraph 6 of the Constitution). The Decision for stopping the execution of the individual acts or actions adopted, that is, undertaken on the basis of the Decree with legal force noted in item 1 of this Decision shall be null and void. In this case, on grounds of Articles 125 and 126 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia, and on the proposal of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia to the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, the President of the Republic, established existence of a state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia for the purposes of preventing the introduction, spread and management of coronavirus COVID-19, and in line with the pandemic epidemic declared by the World Health Organization as a new type of virus that had spread to all continents and affected also the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, no.44-2329\/1 of 18.03.2020 and based on the notification from the President of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia no.09-1690\/2 dated 18.03.2020, the President of the Republic of North Macedonia made a decision determining the existence of a state of emergency no.526\/2 dated 18.03.2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\", no.68\/2020). This decision was made in conditions when in the Republic of North Macedonia the Assembly was dissolved with the Decision of 16.02.2020. According to Article 126 of the Constitution, in case of a state of war or state of emergency, the Government in accordance with the Constitution and the law, adopts decrees with legal force (paragraph 1); The authorisation of the Government to adopt decrees with legal force lasts until the end of the state of war or state of emergency, which is decided by the Assembly (paragraph 2). DECISION WITH LEGAL FORCE TO AMEND THE DECISION WITH LEGAL FORCE TO APPLY THE LAW ON CONSTRUCTION LAND DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY However, keeping in mind the challenged decree with legal force, which amends the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, what is disputable from a constitutional-legal point of view is the regulation of the rights and obligations from the subject matter in a way that is regulated, whereby it is also envisaged that this Decree with legal force will be applied until 31.12.2020, that is, also in a normal state in the society, which has nothing to do with prevention, dissemination, protection and dealing with Covid-19. This Decision was made by the Court composed of the President of the Court, Sali Murati and the judges: Naser Ajdari, Elena Gosheva, Nikola Ivanovski, Jovan Josifovski, Dr Osman Kadriu, Dr Darko Kostadinovski and Vangelina Markudova. However, this is not the case with the disputed decree and hence it is not in accordance with Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution, as well as with Article 15 paragraph 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. Furthermore, it is regulated that the supervision over the performance of the activity within the construction land envisaged by the urban plan or urban planning documentation for a beach be carried out by the State Market Inspectorate and Public Revenue Office, and the failure on the part of the lessee to act is a ground for the State Market Inspectorate to close down the facilities.

Under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution, the rule of law is a fundamental value of the constitutional order in the Republic of North Macedonia. This is because the Constitution clearly stipulates that when the Assembly is unable to meet, the President of the Republic may declare a state of emergency, that the decision to declare it is submitted for confirmation to the Assembly as soon as it can meet. Hence, in the conditions of a contagious disease and the existence of a general danger of infecting the population, generally the measures with the decrees with legal force should refer to the restrictions of rights and obligations that are necessary for the protection of the public interest. The right to life, the prohibition of torture, the inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, the legal nature of the offences and punishments, as well as the freedom of belief, conscience, thought and religion may not be restricted in a state of emergency. The Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020) SHALL BE ANNULLED. 59\/2000, 12\/2003, 55\/2005, 37\/2006, 115\/2007, 19\/2008, 82\/2008, 10\/2010, 51\/2011, 15\/2013, 139\/2014, 196\/2015, 142\/2016, 140\/2018 and Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia \"No.98\/2019), the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 9 June 2020, adopted the following DECISION WITH LEGAL FORCE TO AMEND THE DECISION WITH LEGAL FORCE TO APPLY THE LAW ON CONSTRUCTION LAND DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY Pursuant to Article 110 lines 1 and 2 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia decides on the conformity of the laws with the Constitution and on the conformity of other regulations and collective agreements with the Constitution and the laws.

PRESIDENT of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia Sali Murati Hence, by decree with legal force, in case of a state of emergency, the Government may otherwise regulate certain issues that are regulated by applicable laws, may set new deadlines, may change existing ones and adopt new decisions. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution, the rule of law is a fundamental value of the constitutional order in the Republic of North Macedonia.

On the basis of Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.70\/1992 and \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.202\/2019) at its session held on 23 September 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia adopted the following The Court does not hold disputable the restriction of the rights for the purpose of health care in conditions of pandemic and declared state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia due to the coronavirus, which applies to all citizens. In conditions when the Assembly is not dissolved, it can make a decision determining the existence of a state of emergency, with a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives and is valid for a maximum of 30 days in accordance with Article 125 of the Constitution. Starting from the above, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of this Decision. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution, the rule of law is a fundamental value of the constitutional order in the Republic of North Macedonia. With its Decision U.no.209\/2020 of 8 July 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia initiated a procedure for assessing the constitutionality of the Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency no.44-5217\/1 from 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020). At its session the Court found that on the basis of Article 126 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 36 paragraph 1 of the Law on the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" Nos. The new provisions of the Decree with legal force require the construction land envisaged by the urban plan or urban planning documentation for a beach, and which was subject of a short-term lease that has expired or the short-term lease contract is terminated prematurely, to be immediately restored to its original condition by the lessee and further performance of the activity by the lessee is prohibited. The Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020) SHALL BE ANNULLED. Starting from the provisions of Article 126 of the Constitution that in case of a state of war or state of emergency the Government adopts decrees with legal force and this authorisation of the Government lasts until the end of the state of war or state of emergency which is decided by the Assembly, the right to adopt decrees with legal force is undisputed. This is because the Constitution clearly stipulates that when the Assembly is unable to meet, the President of the Republic may declare a state of emergency, that the decision to declare it is submitted for confirmation to the Assembly as soon as it can meet. Everyone is obliged to respect the Constitution and the laws. This is because the Constitution clearly stipulates that when the Assembly is unable to meet, the President of the Republic may declare a state of emergency, that the decision to declare it is submitted for confirmation to the Assembly as soon as it can meet. At its session the Court found that on the basis of Article 126 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 36 paragraph 1 of the Law on the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" Nos. The Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 16 February 2020, adopted a Decision on the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.43\/20120). However, this is not the case with the disputed decree and hence it is not in accordance with Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution, as well as with Article 15 paragraph 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. At its session the Court found that on the basis of Article 126 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 36 paragraph 1 of the Law on the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" Nos. However, keeping in mind the challenged decree with legal force, which amends the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, what is disputable from a constitutional-legal point of view is the regulation of the rights and obligations from the subject matter in a way that is regulated, whereby it is also envisaged that this Decree with legal force will be applied until 31.12.2020, that is, also in a normal state in the society, which has nothing to do with prevention, dissemination, protection and dealing with Covid-19. Such regulation is not proportionate and does not justify the public interest in a democratic society, that is, it is not necessary to regulate rights and obligations of a legal matter within the competence of the legislature with a decree with legal force by the Government, in the field of social life in the sphere of property-legal relations with the construction land, whose regulation and settlement of the rights and obligations was and is a constant issue of relations within the legal system in a normal state. The existence of a contagious disease cannot be justified as a necessary and legitimate regulation of the relations of the lessees of the construction land in the part of the beaches. The construction land envisaged by the urban plan or urban planning documentation for a beach, which was subject to a short-term lease, and the time limit for short-term lease has expired or the short-term lease contract has been terminated prematurely, shall be restored to its original condition by the lessee and further performance of activity by the lessee shall be prohibited\".

Interference with legal regulations through decrees with legal force with the rights and obligations of the lessees of construction land, as well as in the authorisations, and in conditions of a general pandemic in which the citizens find themselves on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, could have a ground if there is a proportionality and connection of the restraint measures with the situation to achieve the set health goals to stop the spread of the epidemic. However, if the Assembly cannot convene, the decision for the existence of a state of emergency is made by the President of the Republic who submits it to the Assembly for confirmation as soon as it can convene. With its Decision U.no.209\/2020 of 8 July 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia initiated a procedure for assessing the constitutionality of the Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency no.44-5217\/1 from 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020). The Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 16 February 2020, adopted a Decision on the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.43\/20120). Pursuant to Article 110 lines 1 and 2 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia decides on the conformity of the laws with the Constitution and on the conformity of other regulations and collective agreements with the Constitution and the laws. The Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020) SHALL BE ANNULLED. The Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 16 February 2020, adopted a Decision on the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.43\/20120). This Decision was made by the Court composed of the President of the Court, Sali Murati and the judges: Naser Ajdari, Elena Gosheva, Nikola Ivanovski, Jovan Josifovski, Dr Osman Kadriu, Dr Darko Kostadinovski and Vangelina Markudova. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of North Macedonia the laws must be in accordance with the Constitution, and all other regulations with the Constitution and the law. The Court holds that the reason that is the ground for the adoption of decrees with legal force in a state of emergency, and that is the existence of a contagious disease, in this case cannot be a reason that justifies the regime regulated by the disputed Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for the application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency. The existence of a contagious disease cannot be justified as a necessary and legitimate regulation of the relations of the lessees of the construction land in the part of the beaches. Interference with legal regulations through decrees with legal force with the rights and obligations of the lessees of construction land, as well as in the authorisations, and in conditions of a general pandemic in which the citizens find themselves on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, could have a ground if there is a proportionality and connection of the restraint measures with the situation to achieve the set health goals to stop the spread of the epidemic. Starting from the above, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of this Decision. In this case, on grounds of Articles 125 and 126 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia, and on the proposal of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia to the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, the President of the Republic, established existence of a state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia for the purposes of preventing the introduction, spread and management of coronavirus COVID-19, and in line with the pandemic epidemic declared by the World Health Organization as a new type of virus that had spread to all continents and affected also the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, no.44-2329\/1 of 18.03.2020 and based on the notification from the President of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia no.09-1690\/2 dated 18.03.2020, the President of the Republic of North Macedonia made a decision determining the existence of a state of emergency no.526\/2 dated 18.03.2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\", no.68\/2020). Namely, the Constitution has two constitutional restrictions on the authority of the Government to adopt decrees with legal force. On the basis of Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.70\/1992 and \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.202\/2019) at its session held on 23 September 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia adopted the following The Court holds that the reason that is the ground for the adoption of decrees with legal force in a state of emergency, and that is the existence of a contagious disease, in this case cannot be a reason that justifies the regime regulated by the disputed Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for the application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency. The Decision for stopping the execution of the individual acts or actions adopted, that is, undertaken on the basis of the Decree with legal force noted in item 1 of this Decision shall be null and void. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of North Macedonia the laws must be in accordance with the Constitution, and all other regulations with the Constitution and the law. Such regulation is not proportionate and does not justify the public interest in a democratic society, that is, it is not necessary to regulate rights and obligations of a legal matter within the competence of the legislature with a decree with legal force by the Government, in the field of social life in the sphere of property-legal relations with the construction land, whose regulation and settlement of the rights and obligations was and is a constant issue of relations within the legal system in a normal state. However, in this case the provisions of the disputed decree with legal force contain no measures but a regime of regulation of relations, and the disputed decree with legal force does not meet the criteria or justified reasons that would be aimed at protecting the public interest in the presence of an epidemic of infectious disease, due to which a state of emergency was declared in the country. The second restriction is regulated in Article 54 of the Constitution, whose satisfaction requires that the restriction of freedoms and rights in a state of emergency cannot be discriminatory on the grounds of sex, race, skin colour, language, religion, national or social origin, property or social status. The first one is for the decrees to regulate the necessary measures that are functionally related to directly or indirectly confronting and overcoming the causes and consequences of the state of emergency, taking into account that the measures have a legitimate aim, social justification, be reasonable and proportionate in light of as soon as possible restoration of the normal state (which will essentially satisfy Articles 125 and 126 of the Constitution). This Decision shall generate legal effect from the day of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\". The Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020) SHALL BE ANNULLED. This Decree with legal force shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\", and shall be applied until 31.12.2020. The Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 16 February 2020, adopted a Decision on the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.43\/20120). This Decision shall generate legal effect from the day of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\". The issue of enacting decrees with legal force in conditions of a state of emergency is related to the state of emergency and such authority is given to the Government undisputably by the Constitution. Starting from the above, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of this Decision. The Court holds that the reason that is the ground for the adoption of decrees with legal force in a state of emergency, and that is the existence of a contagious disease, in this case cannot be a reason that justifies the regime regulated by the disputed Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for the application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency. The existence of a contagious disease cannot be justified as a necessary and legitimate regulation of the relations of the lessees of the construction land in the part of the beaches. Interference with legal regulations through decrees with legal force with the rights and obligations of the lessees of construction land, as well as in the authorisations, and in conditions of a general pandemic in which the citizens find themselves on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, could have a ground if there is a proportionality and connection of the restraint measures with the situation to achieve the set health goals to stop the spread of the epidemic. The Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020) SHALL BE ANNULLED. With its Decision U.no.209\/2020 of 8 July 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia initiated a procedure for assessing the constitutionality of the Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency no.44-5217\/1 from 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020). Article 2-b The Decision for stopping the execution of the individual acts or actions adopted, that is, undertaken on the basis of the Decree with legal force noted in item 1 of this Decision shall be null and void. In the part of the Constitution which refers to \"Defence of the Republic, state of war and state of emergency\", Article 125 stipulates: \"State of emergency occurs when major natural disasters or epidemics occur (paragraph 1); The existence of a state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia or its part is determined by the Assembly upon the proposal of the President of the Republic, the Government or at least 30 Representatives (paragraph 2); The decision determining the existence of a state of emergency is made by a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives and is valid for a maximum of 30 days (paragraph 3); If the Assembly cannot convene, the President of the Republic decides on the existence of a state of emergency and submits it to the Assembly for confirmation as soon as it is able to convene (paragraph 4). U.no.209\/2020 23 September 2020 Skopje No.44-5217\/1 President of the Government 9 June 2020 of the Republic of North Macedonia, Skopje Oliver Spasovski, (signed) However, if the Assembly cannot convene, the decision for the existence of a state of emergency is made by the President of the Republic who submits it to the Assembly for confirmation as soon as it can convene. The new provisions of the Decree with legal force require the construction land envisaged by the urban plan or urban planning documentation for a beach, and which was subject of a short-term lease that has expired or the short-term lease contract is terminated prematurely, to be immediately restored to its original condition by the lessee and further performance of the activity by the lessee is prohibited. However, if the Assembly cannot convene, the decision for the existence of a state of emergency is made by the President of the Republic who submits it to the Assembly for confirmation as soon as it can convene. No.44-5217\/1 President of the Government 9 June 2020 of the Republic of North Macedonia, Skopje Oliver Spasovski, (signed) This Decision was made by the Court composed of the President of the Court, Sali Murati and the judges: Naser Ajdari, Elena Gosheva, Nikola Ivanovski, Jovan Josifovski, Dr Osman Kadriu, Dr Darko Kostadinovski and Vangelina Markudova. The Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 16 February 2020, adopted a Decision on the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.43\/20120). From the analysis of the Decree with legal force for amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020), the Court holds that it was adopted 14 days before the end of the state of emergency on 23 June 2020 and it adds two new articles, 2-a and 2-b which regulate rights and obligations in directly linked with entities related to the lease of construction land. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of North Macedonia the laws must be in accordance with the Constitution, and all other regulations with the Constitution and the law. According to Article 126 of the Constitution, in case of a state of war or state of emergency, the Government in accordance with the Constitution and the law, adopts decrees with legal force (paragraph 1); The authorisation of the Government to adopt decrees with legal force lasts until the end of the state of war or state of emergency, which is decided by the Assembly (paragraph 2). The Court holds that the reason that is the ground for the adoption of decrees with legal force in a state of emergency, and that is the existence of a contagious disease, in this case cannot be a reason that justifies the regime regulated by the disputed Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for the application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency. The existence of a contagious disease cannot be justified as a necessary and legitimate regulation of the relations of the lessees of the construction land in the part of the beaches. The issue of enacting decrees with legal force in conditions of a state of emergency is related to the state of emergency and such authority is given to the Government undisputably by the Constitution. Starting from the above, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of this Decision. Namely, the Constitution has two constitutional restrictions on the authority of the Government to adopt decrees with legal force. 59\/2000, 12\/2003, 55\/2005, 37\/2006, 115\/2007, 19\/2008, 82\/2008, 10\/2010, 51\/2011, 15\/2013, 139\/2014, 196\/2015, 142\/2016, 140\/2018 and Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia \"No.98\/2019), the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 9 June 2020, adopted the following Hence, in the conditions of a contagious disease and the existence of a general danger of infecting the population, generally the measures with the decrees with legal force should refer to the restrictions of rights and obligations that are necessary for the protection of the public interest. However, this is not the case with the disputed decree and hence it is not in accordance with Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution, as well as with Article 15 paragraph 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. On the basis of Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.70\/1992 and \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.202\/2019) at its session held on 23 September 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia adopted the following Pursuant to Article 63 paragraph 6 of the Constitution, the Assembly shall be dissolved if the majority of the total number of Representatives so decides. The Decision for stopping the execution of the individual acts or actions adopted, that is, undertaken on the basis of the Decree with legal force noted in item 1 of this Decision shall be null and void. At its session the Court found that on the basis of Article 126 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 36 paragraph 1 of the Law on the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" Nos. The existence of a contagious disease cannot be justified as a necessary and legitimate regulation of the relations of the lessees of the construction land in the part of the beaches. Namely, the Constitution has two constitutional restrictions on the authority of the Government to adopt decrees with legal force. DECISION WITH LEGAL FORCE TO AMEND THE DECISION WITH LEGAL FORCE TO APPLY THE LAW ON CONSTRUCTION LAND DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY From the analysis of the Decree with legal force for amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020), the Court holds that it was adopted 14 days before the end of the state of emergency on 23 June 2020 and it adds two new articles, 2-a and 2-b which regulate rights and obligations in directly linked with entities related to the lease of construction land. The Court does not hold disputable the restriction of the rights for the purpose of health care in conditions of pandemic and declared state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia due to the coronavirus, which applies to all citizens. In conditions when the Assembly is not dissolved, it can make a decision determining the existence of a state of emergency, with a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives and is valid for a maximum of 30 days in accordance with Article 125 of the Constitution. No.44-5217\/1 President of the Government 9 June 2020 of the Republic of North Macedonia, Skopje Oliver Spasovski, (signed) Hence, by decree with legal force, in case of a state of emergency, the Government may otherwise regulate certain issues that are regulated by applicable laws, may set new deadlines, may change existing ones and adopt new decisions. The issue of enacting decrees with legal force in conditions of a state of emergency is related to the state of emergency and such authority is given to the Government undisputably by the Constitution. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of North Macedonia the laws must be in accordance with the Constitution, and all other regulations with the Constitution and the law. Such regulation is not proportionate and does not justify the public interest in a democratic society, that is, it is not necessary to regulate rights and obligations of a legal matter within the competence of the legislature with a decree with legal force by the Government, in the field of social life in the sphere of property-legal relations with the construction land, whose regulation and settlement of the rights and obligations was and is a constant issue of relations within the legal system in a normal state. The Court holds that the reason that is the ground for the adoption of decrees with legal force in a state of emergency, and that is the existence of a contagious disease, in this case cannot be a reason that justifies the regime regulated by the disputed Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for the application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency. However, keeping in mind the challenged decree with legal force, which amends the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, what is disputable from a constitutional-legal point of view is the regulation of the rights and obligations from the subject matter in a way that is regulated, whereby it is also envisaged that this Decree with legal force will be applied until 31.12.2020, that is, also in a normal state in the society, which has nothing to do with prevention, dissemination, protection and dealing with Covid-19. Article 15 paragraph 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights stipulates that in the event of war or any other general danger endangering the life of a nation, any High Contracting Party may take measures that deviate from its obligations under this Convention, strictly in accordance with the requirements of the situation and provided that such measures do not conflict with other obligations arising from international law. This Decision was made by the Court composed of the President of the Court, Sali Murati and the judges: Naser Ajdari, Elena Gosheva, Nikola Ivanovski, Jovan Josifovski, Dr Osman Kadriu, Dr Darko Kostadinovski and Vangelina Markudova. The Court does not hold disputable the restriction of the rights for the purpose of health care in conditions of pandemic and declared state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia due to the coronavirus, which applies to all citizens. In conditions when the Assembly is not dissolved, it can make a decision determining the existence of a state of emergency, with a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives and is valid for a maximum of 30 days in accordance with Article 125 of the Constitution. Article 2-b U.no.209\/2020 23 September 2020 Skopje With its Decision U.no.209\/2020 of 8 July 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia initiated a procedure for assessing the constitutionality of the Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency no.44-5217\/1 from 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020). At the same time, pending a final decision, the Court suspended the execution of the individual acts or actions undertaken on grounds of the disputed decree. Starting from the provisions of Article 126 of the Constitution that in case of a state of war or state of emergency the Government adopts decrees with legal force and this authorisation of the Government lasts until the end of the state of war or state of emergency which is decided by the Assembly, the right to adopt decrees with legal force is undisputed. On the basis of Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.70\/1992 and \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.202\/2019) at its session held on 23 September 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia adopted the following This is because the Constitution clearly stipulates that when the Assembly is unable to meet, the President of the Republic may declare a state of emergency, that the decision to declare it is submitted for confirmation to the Assembly as soon as it can meet. The second restriction is regulated in Article 54 of the Constitution, whose satisfaction requires that the restriction of freedoms and rights in a state of emergency cannot be discriminatory on the grounds of sex, race, skin colour, language, religion, national or social origin, property or social status. From the analysis of the Decree with legal force for amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020), the Court holds that it was adopted 14 days before the end of the state of emergency on 23 June 2020 and it adds two new articles, 2-a and 2-b which regulate rights and obligations in directly linked with entities related to the lease of construction land. Article 2 This Decree with legal force shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\", and shall be applied until 31.12.2020. Starting from the above, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of this Decision. The Court holds that the reason that is the ground for the adoption of decrees with legal force in a state of emergency, and that is the existence of a contagious disease, in this case cannot be a reason that justifies the regime regulated by the disputed Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for the application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency. The President of the Republic also after the expiration of the declared state of emergency of 30 days made four consecutive decisions determining the existence of a state of emergency, number 08-607\/2 of 16 April 2020 (\"Official Gazette of Republic of North Macedonia\" No.104\/2020), No.08-682\/2 of 16 May 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.127\/2020), No.08-729\/2 of 30 May 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.142\/2020), and No.08-777\/3 of 15 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.159\/2020), valid until 23 June 2020. PRESIDENT of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia Sali Murati Two new Articles 2-a and 2-b are added following Article 2 in the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.90\/2020), which shall read: According to Article 126 of the Constitution, in case of a state of war or state of emergency, the Government in accordance with the Constitution and the law, adopts decrees with legal force (paragraph 1); The authorisation of the Government to adopt decrees with legal force lasts until the end of the state of war or state of emergency, which is decided by the Assembly (paragraph 2). Interference with legal regulations through decrees with legal force with the rights and obligations of the lessees of construction land, as well as in the authorisations, and in conditions of a general pandemic in which the citizens find themselves on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, could have a ground if there is a proportionality and connection of the restraint measures with the situation to achieve the set health goals to stop the spread of the epidemic. The Court holds that the reason that is the ground for the adoption of decrees with legal force in a state of emergency, and that is the existence of a contagious disease, in this case cannot be a reason that justifies the regime regulated by the disputed Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for the application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency. The existence of a contagious disease cannot be justified as a necessary and legitimate regulation of the relations of the lessees of the construction land in the part of the beaches. On the basis of Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.70\/1992 and \"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.202\/2019) at its session held on 23 September 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia adopted the following The Court does not hold disputable the restriction of the rights for the purpose of health care in conditions of pandemic and declared state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia due to the coronavirus, which applies to all citizens. The Decision for stopping the execution of the individual acts or actions adopted, that is, undertaken on the basis of the Decree with legal force noted in item 1 of this Decision shall be null and void. This Decision was made by the Court composed of the President of the Court, Sali Murati and the judges: Naser Ajdari, Elena Gosheva, Nikola Ivanovski, Jovan Josifovski, Dr Osman Kadriu, Dr Darko Kostadinovski and Vangelina Markudova. Starting from the above, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of this Decision. Pursuant to Article 63 paragraph 6 of the Constitution, the Assembly shall be dissolved if the majority of the total number of Representatives so decides. Pursuant to Article 110 lines 1 and 2 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia decides on the conformity of the laws with the Constitution and on the conformity of other regulations and collective agreements with the Constitution and the laws. In conditions when the Assembly is not dissolved, it can make a decision determining the existence of a state of emergency, with a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives and is valid for a maximum of 30 days in accordance with Article 125 of the Constitution.

The Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, at its session held on 16 February 2020, adopted a Decision on the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.43\/20120). This is because the Constitution clearly stipulates that when the Assembly is unable to meet, the President of the Republic may declare a state of emergency, that the decision to declare it is submitted for confirmation to the Assembly as soon as it can meet. Two new Articles 2-a and 2-b are added following Article 2 in the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.90\/2020), which shall read: \"Article 2-a The Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020) SHALL BE ANNULLED. Furthermore, it is regulated that the supervision over the performance of the activity within the construction land envisaged by the urban plan or urban planning documentation for a beach be carried out by the State Market Inspectorate and Public Revenue Office, and the failure on the part of the lessee to act is a ground for the State Market Inspectorate to close down the facilities. The issue from a constitutional-legal character if the Government has the authority to adopt decrees with legal force is not disputable since the Constitution grants such authority and there is a constitutional ground for that, especially since in the concept of the Constitution the Government remains on duty until the election of a new government even when its mandate has terminated due to the dissolution of the Assembly (Article 93 paragraph 5 of the Constitution) and the Assembly is dissolved if the majority of the total number of Representatives in the Assembly agrees (Article 63 paragraph 6 of the Constitution). In conditions when the Assembly is not dissolved, it can make a decision determining the existence of a state of emergency, with a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of Representatives and is valid for a maximum of 30 days in accordance with Article 125 of the Constitution. The President of the Republic also after the expiration of the declared state of emergency of 30 days made four consecutive decisions determining the existence of a state of emergency, number 08-607\/2 of 16 April 2020 (\"Official Gazette of Republic of North Macedonia\" No.104\/2020), No.08-682\/2 of 16 May 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.127\/2020), No.08-729\/2 of 30 May 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.142\/2020), and No.08-777\/3 of 15 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.159\/2020), valid until 23 June 2020. Pursuant to Article 63 paragraph 6 of the Constitution, the Assembly shall be dissolved if the majority of the total number of Representatives so decides. However, if the Assembly cannot convene, the decision for the existence of a state of emergency is made by the President of the Republic who submits it to the Assembly for confirmation as soon as it can convene. The Court does not hold disputable the restriction of the rights for the purpose of health care in conditions of pandemic and declared state of emergency on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia due to the coronavirus, which applies to all citizens. PRESIDENT of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia Sali Murati This Decision was made by the Court composed of the President of the Court, Sali Murati and the judges: Naser Ajdari, Elena Gosheva, Nikola Ivanovski, Jovan Josifovski, Dr Osman Kadriu, Dr Darko Kostadinovski and Vangelina Markudova. This decision was made in conditions when in the Republic of North Macedonia the Assembly was dissolved with the Decision of 16.02.2020. The President of the Republic also after the expiration of the declared state of emergency of 30 days made four consecutive decisions determining the existence of a state of emergency, number 08-607\/2 of 16 April 2020 (\"Official Gazette of Republic of North Macedonia\" No.104\/2020), No.08-682\/2 of 16 May 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.127\/2020), No.08-729\/2 of 30 May 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.142\/2020), and No.08-777\/3 of 15 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.159\/2020), valid until 23 June 2020. With its Decision U.no.209\/2020 of 8 July 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia initiated a procedure for assessing the constitutionality of the Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency no.44-5217\/1 from 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020). Article 15 paragraph 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights stipulates that in the event of war or any other general danger endangering the life of a nation, any High Contracting Party may take measures that deviate from its obligations under this Convention, strictly in accordance with the requirements of the situation and provided that such measures do not conflict with other obligations arising from international law. With its Decision U.no.209\/2020 of 8 July 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of North Macedonia initiated a procedure for assessing the constitutionality of the Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency no.44-5217\/1 from 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020). The Decree with legal force amending the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency, no.44-5217\/1 of 9 June 2020 (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" no.154\/2020) SHALL BE ANNULLED. This Decision was made by the Court composed of the President of the Court, Sali Murati and the judges: Naser Ajdari, Elena Gosheva, Nikola Ivanovski, Jovan Josifovski, Dr Osman Kadriu, Dr Darko Kostadinovski and Vangelina Markudova. Supervision over the performance of the activity within the construction land envisaged by the urban plan or urban planning documentation for a beach shall be carried out by the State Market Inspectorate and the Public Revenue Office, and the lessee's failure to act in accordance with Article 2-a of this decree shall be a ground for the State Market Inspectorate to close the facilities. Such regulation is not proportionate and does not justify the public interest in a democratic society, that is, it is not necessary to regulate rights and obligations of a legal matter within the competence of the legislature with a decree with legal force by the Government, in the field of social life in the sphere of property-legal relations with the construction land, whose regulation and settlement of the rights and obligations was and is a constant issue of relations within the legal system in a normal state. No.44-5217\/1 President of the Government 9 June 2020 of the Republic of North Macedonia, Skopje Oliver Spasovski, (signed) At the same time, pending a final decision, the Court suspended the execution of the individual acts or actions undertaken on grounds of the disputed decree. Two new Articles 2-a and 2-b are added following Article 2 in the Decree with legal force for application of the Law on Construction Land during a state of emergency (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia\" No.90\/2020), which shall read: \"Article 2-a At its session the Court found that on the basis of Article 126 paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia and Article 36 paragraph 1 of the Law on the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" Nos. Interference with legal regulations through decrees with legal force with the rights and obligations of the lessees of construction land, as well as in the authorisations, and in conditions of a general pandemic in which the citizens find themselves on the territory of the Republic of North Macedonia, could have a ground if there is a proportionality and connection of the restraint measures with the situation to achieve the set health goals to stop the spread of the epidemic. However, in this case the provisions of the disputed decree with legal force contain no measures but a regime of regulation of relations, and the disputed decree with legal force does not meet the criteria or justified reasons that would be aimed at protecting the public interest in the presence of an epidemic of infectious disease, due to which a state of emergency was declared in the country.",

Today the Catholic Church, continues to serve the believers in the Bitola region, proudly standing also as one of the main city tourist attractions in Bitola.

What we bring as a decision, the media are here to publish, what we initiate, they are here to ask, to follow up how far along the procedure is. All of our sessions are transparent, it publishes its decisions publicly and transparently on its website \u2013 everything it does is public\", said Ivanovska at the beginning of her speech, pointing out that the new law has also given them the possibility, should they have pressures, to turn to the Parliament, which is especially important as a tool for achieving transparency and independence, but also as a form of public pressure. First of all, every one of us needs to be clear in the fight within ourselves, first not to pay for a service that we are entitled to, and not to demand a bribe for what we are doing. With that procedure (for whistle-blowers) they receive full protection from the state. Biljana Ivanovska, President of the State Commission for Prevention of Corruption and Conflict of Interests, as one of the speakers at CIVIL's seminar \"Transparency and responsibility in the political processes\", defined the fundamental obligations, but also the expectations from the SCPC, as well as the need for cooperation with the civil sector, the media, institutions, and, of course, with every citizens individually. These are our first modest beginnings in the cooperation with the civil sector, but every success is due to the beginning.\t\u041e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0446\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0453\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0458 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0445 \u0441\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a. I am not a lawyer, but I have a strong sense of justice and fairness, and that is why I will fight. The fight is in us, it just needs to surface. You are putting that as a strategic goal, on the one hand, it is humiliating to say that you do not have the money. Corruption violates the rule of law, it violates human rights, moral values.\t\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0448\u0438 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e, \u0433\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0448\u0438 \u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430, \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. That should be something that is shameful to do. They are not allowed to even identify them. It's very difficult from that aspect\", Ivanovska explained the structure and financing of the SCPC, in the concluding part of her speech, after which there was a two-hour discussion on the topic corruption, and how to combat it. People are literally dissatisfied with this country, the anger is felt in the text, the way the complaint is written. I think that together we will succeed to arrive to results! Furthermore, transparency of the Commission has increased because of civil society organizations. No one has been left without a reply. Because we were abused, political parties quarrelled through us with complaints. That is why we will be more among the citizens, in the institutions, to tell people not to sell themselves, real human destinies are being traded\", stated Ivanovska, referring to education of citizens and their effort to be more among them and in their service, to continuously strengthen citizens' awareness, to encourage them that they don't owe anyone anything. The first significant change made under the pressure of citizen associations is the manner of electing the Commission, as a first factor that enables non-political, decisive and non-selective action. The budget has been made according to the previous year, when the commission wasn't functioning. Now it has two pages of competencies. If we are a critical mass, from here on we will continue to do and behave as such, to build a healthy tissue\", stressed Ivanovska. That is a big step\", says Ivanovska, urging for citizens not to be afraid, and that the SCPC has taken the obligation to encourage them not to keep silent in the face of injustice. This means that we will lose half a year until we get that software. We changed the rules of procedure in order not to put all such complaints in a session, but to check them, whether they are grounded or not, and to put the decisions in a session. Much information is being sent to us and many people have responded, for which we are truly pleased.\t\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u045c\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043b\u0443\u0453\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0430, \u0448\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438 \u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e. Something that everyone can do in strengthening citizens' awareness. Ivanovska, SCPC, on transparency and responsibility in the fight against corruption (part 1) When it will be condemned as something shameful, then we will have a fight against corruption. Thanks to the participation of the civil society, significant changes have been made in the laws, including the Law on Prevention of Corruption. In these six months, we now already have 12 cases, some in the final phase. Through specific examples, openly, transparently and responsibly, Ivanovska brought the most important institution in the fight against corruption closer to the citizens. , Ivanovska was categorical.\t, \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0435 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430.",

        "text":"She opened her own company in partnership with Mack Sennett in 1916. [16][17] [citation needed] Around that same time, Normand allegedly had a miscarriage (or stillbirth) with Goldwyn's child. It was based in Culver City and was a subsidiary of the Triangle Film Corporation. Mabel Normand has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to motion pictures at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1918, as her relationship with Sennett came to an end, Normand signed a $3,500-per-week contract with Samuel Goldwyn. Before she entered films at age 16 in 1909, Normand worked as an artist's model, which included posing for postcards illustrated by Charles Dana Gibson, creator of the Gibson Girl image, as well as for Butterick's clothing pattern manufacturers in lower Manhattan.[citation needed] For a short time, she worked for Vitagraph Studios in New York City for $25 per week, but Vitagraph founder Albert E. Smith admitted she was one of several actresses about whom he made a mistake in estimating their \"potential for future stardom.\"[11] Director William Desmond Taylor shared her interest in books, and the two formed a close relationship. Her earlier Keystone films portrayed her as a bathing beauty, but Normand quickly demonstrated a flair for comedy and became a major star of Sennett's short films.[citation needed] In 1914, she starred with Marie Dressler and Chaplin in Tillie's Punctured Romance, the first feature-length comedy. Author Robert Giroux claims that Taylor was deeply in love with Normand, who had originally approached him for help in curing her alleged cocaine dependency. However, Normand's career had already slowed, and her reputation was tarnished. She embarked on a topsy-turvy relationship with him; he later brought her across to California when he founded Keystone Studios in 1912. After an extended stay in Pottenger Sanitorium, she died from pulmonary tuberculosis on February 23, 1930 in Monrovia, California at the age of 36.[26] She was interred as Mabel Normand-Cody at Calvary Cemetery, Los Angeles. She is credited as being the first film star to receive a pie thrown in the face.[12] They blew kisses to each other as her limousine drove away. Normand was the last person known to have seen Taylor alive. Born Amabel Ethelreid Normand in New Brighton, Richmond County, New York (before it was incorporated into New York City), she grew up in a working-class family. She was named after her father's only sibling, Mabel, who had died before her birth in 1892. She had 5 siblings, although only two survived into adulthood, the rest succumbing to tuberculosis.[citation needed] Her mother, Mary \"Minnie\" Drury, of Providence, Rhode Island,[9] was of Irish heritage, while her father was French Canadian, with his ancestral lineage dating back to Normandy, France, and their surname originally being LeNormand or Le Normand.[10] Her father, Clodman \"Claude\" George Normand, was employed as a cabinetmaker and stage carpenter at Sailors' Snug Harbor home for elderly seamen.[citation needed] Her intensely beguiling lead performance, directed by D. W. Griffith in the dramatic 1911 short film Her Awakening, drew attention and she met director Mack Sennett while at Griffith's Biograph Company. The films were released with extensive publicity support from the Hollywood community, including her friend Mary Pickford. In 1926, she married actor Lew Cody, with whom she had appeared in Mickey in 1918.[25] They lived separately in nearby houses in Beverly Hills. However, Normand's health was in decline due to tuberculosis. She was exonerated in the first crime, and disregarded from the second, but her film career declined. Normand appeared with Charles Chaplin and Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle in many short films. Most historians agree Normand persuaded Sennett to give Chaplin another chance,[14] and she and Chaplin appeared together in a dozen subsequent films, almost always as a couple in the lead roles.",

This kinder garden will have a capacity of about 200 children which additionally solves the issue of placing children in kinder gardens for another 200 families in Shtip. The kinder garden should be completely ready in September this year. Today I am visiting Municipality of Shtip and the Municipality of Kochani where I see kinder gardens, objects, social work centers in order to determine the dynamics and development of the implementation of the reforms that are being implemented in the Ministry of Labor and social policy, added Carovska. We started last September and we are expecting this kinder garden to be ready this September or October and we should immediately start placing the equipment inside, which will put the kinder garden into operation as soon as possible, said Mayor Bochvarski.

The company has been issued an Integrated IPPC License, and according to its provisions, the company applies the latest technological practices to its operations. Cementarnica USJE operates in line with the highest environmental standards. Moreover, the company has been continuously investing in modernization and all its operations are in line with state-of-the-art technology that meets the high environmental protection standards.

Namely, in summer, when USJE operates with a much higher intensity, the concentration of PM particles in the city is much lower, which is an additional argument that increase or decrease of PM particles is not directly related to USJE's operations.

        "text":"Bugatti and Rimac will both continue as separate respective brands, retaining existing production facilities and distribution channels,\" Rimac said. \"Bugatti Rimac represents the company that will develop the future of both Bugatti and Rimac vehicles, by joining resources and expertise in research and development, production, and other areas. Having lost British luxury brand Rolls Royce to domestic rivals BMW, Piech and BMW CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder \u2014 together with Ralph Robins of Rolls \u2014 struck an accord allowing sister company Bentley to continue to use Rolls Royce powerplants. At least part of the reasoning behind Audi's 2016 withdrawal was surely Porsche's return to the fastest class of endurance racing, LMP1. But according to Rimac's press release, the Croatian company will retain full ownership and control of a new company, called Rimac Technology, that will continue developing its drivetrains, batteries and other components for electric vehicles.

As CEO of Rimac Group, he will run both Bugatti Rimac and the new division, Rimac Technology. Bugatti cars will continued to be assembled in eastern France, where the company was first founded in 1909. Bugatti and Rimac will both continue as separate respective brands, retaining existing production facilities and distribution channels,\" Rimac said. The merger partners one of the world's highest-performance electric carmakers with the company producing the fastest petrol-powered road car on the planet. After decades in the business, Piech passed away suddenly on August 27, 2019 at the age of 82. At least part of the reasoning behind Audi's 2016 withdrawal was surely Porsche's return to the fastest class of endurance racing, LMP1. But according to Rimac's press release, the Croatian company will retain full ownership and control of a new company, called Rimac Technology, that will continue developing its drivetrains, batteries and other components for electric vehicles. Unlike \"quattro,\" that was an Audi world first. Here, Piech and Schr\u00f6der are reunited in the Czech Republic, at the 2001 factory opening of a new Skoda plant. Perhaps that's also why Piech was sent to cut his engineering teeth as head of development in the 1970s. The automotive cousins were therefore competing directly on the track \u2014 making each other's lives harder. The Porsche division will retain a 24% stake, Hyundai will hold 12%, and other investors will hold the remaining 27%. The Porsche division will retain a 24% stake, Hyundai will hold 12%, and other investors will hold the remaining 27%. Bugatti and Rimac will both continue as separate respective brands, retaining existing production facilities and distribution channels,\" Rimac said. To all intents and purposes, though, the VW Group revived the brand from the ashes around the turn of the century, developing and building first the Bugatti Veyron and then its successor the Chiron. He got out just in time to dodge \"Dieselgate,\" as it transpired. Mate Rimac will lead the new company.\t\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u0420\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0446 \u045c\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430

After the liberation of Skopje in 1944, the building was a seat of the whole administration of the Macedonian People's authorities: the President of the Democratic Republic of Macedonia, the People's Assembly, the Government and the Constitutional Court. The Small Official Hall, the Constitutional Committee hall, the restaurant and the cabinets were arranged with wainscot intrasion. In 2005 the project for unimpeded movement of persons with special needs in the building of the Assembly was realized, with a ramp at the entrance, elevator in the inner yard and 4 elevator-platforms at the stairs inside the building, as well as a special entrance with a ramp for the restaurant in the basement. The facade decoration possesses geometrical contents, present in separate parts. At the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005 the roof of the pentagonal construction of the building of the Assembly was reconstructed. In 1996 the new restaurant, the Parliamentarians' Club and the new Banquet Hall were constructed. In 1998\/1999 the interior of Parliament Hall (Hall 1) was redecorated, and automatic voting system, audio and video systems and equipment for direct television broadcast were introduced. During 1999\/2000 the fan-cooler heating and cooling system of the whole building was constructed. In 2004 the Memorial Room on the occasion of the ASNOM 60 th anniversary was opened. The building of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia is one of the most monumental structures in the Republic of Macedonia, for which in 1930 competition for design of the building was announced (architect Viktor Lukomski won the competition), and it was built in 1938 following the plan of the Czech architect Victor J.

Hudak. Of the incorporated ornamental components, the most interesting part is the construction of the cabinets and interior, designed by D. Inkriostri (1935-1937) in wood carving \u2013 the Wood Carved Hall, with walls completely covered in wood, divided into geometrical segments, having wood carved different floral and zoomorphic stylised motifs, based on the folk art and tradition. In 1993 the air-conditioning machinery rooms were completely reconstructed and substituted with new modern air-conditioning chambers. The building has been in use since 1939 as an Administration Palace of the local self-government of that time. The decoration was entrusted to Glisa Kostovski, carpenter and wood carver from Tetovo, with his group. During 2005 the project for reconstruction of all the entrances was realized, with overhanging roofs, new massive doors with stained glass and granite flooring. The Official Hall and the Hall in front of it were redecorated in 2001. The Palace of the Assembly has several session halls, the cabinets of the President of the Republic, the President of the Assembly, of the Vice-Presidents, the Chairpersons of the Committees, the Coordinators of the Parliamentary Groups, the Secretary General of the Assembly, his deputies, as well as the heads of the units and departments. In 1994 the interior of the Cabinet of the President of the Assembly and the Hall in front of the cabinet were renewed. After the independence of the Republic of Macedonia in 1991, besides being host to the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, the building became a host to the Cabinet of the President of the Republic. In 1966\/67 the Parliamentary Hall was reconstructed, and two new Halls, Hall 3 and Hall 4 were built. The building was designed in modern architectural language for that time, with specific massive, lively volume decorated with pure facade elements, in a form of external pentagon with internal yard and a hall. In the period 1954-1963, the Official Hall and Hall 2 were constructed and the interior was completed in the smaller halls in the official area, Ohrid and Struga Rooms were decorated with wood carving on the ceilings, walls and doors by the masters of the traditional wood carving school from Ohrid, and the plaster decoration was made by the Drimkol masters.",

        "text":"According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that was released at the time of the games, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.[80] But by December 2014, The Guardian stated that Sochi \"now feels like a ghost town\", citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas, the still-unfinished construction, and the overall effects of Russia's political and economic turmoil.[81] Furthermore, at least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the high costs or the lack of local support,[82] resulting in only a two-city race between Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China. The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire. This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the University of Paris. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896.[38] The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president.[39] The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. The coloured version of the rings\u2014blue, yellow, black, green, and red\u2014over a white field forms the Olympic flag. There were soon four independent investigations underway: by the IOC, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC), and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. For example, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) is the NOC of the Russian Federation. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years in the same year as their summer counterpart.[49] This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.[50] Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. Athletes gather in the stadium during the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. For the ancient Greek games, see Ancient Olympic Games. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem \"Dialogue of the Dead\", published in 1833.[33] Evangelos Zappas, a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.[34] Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859, which was held in an Athens city square. Most of the athletes and officials are housed in the Olympic Village for the duration of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics;[4] and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. Typically, the marathon medals are presented at the Summer Olympics,[150][153] while the cross-country skiing mass start medals are awarded at the Winter Olympics. The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. During the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Athens, Greece, the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Beginning with the 2020 Summer Olympics, the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (summer or winter) will enter immediately before the current host in descending order. The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. For the upcoming games in Beijing, China, see 2022 Winter Olympics. For the ancient Greek games, see Ancient Olympic Games. Medal presentation A medal ceremony at the 2008 Summer Olympics with (from left to right): the Danish flag, the Union Flag of the UK, and the New Zealand flag The 114th IOC Session, in 2002, limited the Summer Games programme to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes.[168] Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major programme revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official programme of the 2012 London Games. For the most recent games in Tokyo, Japan, see 2020 Summer Olympics. In 1850, an Olympian Class was started by William Penny Brookes at Much Wenlock, in Shropshire, England. For the most recent games in Tokyo, Japan, see 2020 Summer Olympics. The 1906 Games were officially recognised by the IOC at the time (although not any longer), and no Intercalated Games have been held since.[47] Current Olympic sports, like badminton, basketball, and volleyball, first appeared on the programme as demonstration sports, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. This article is about the modern games in general. The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the programme.[162] Olympic sports are governed by international sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC.[163] There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included in the Olympic programme. The coloured version of the rings\u2014blue, yellow, black, green, and red\u2014over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. [154] As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100 million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.[149] Athletes gather in the stadium during the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. These colours were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. A medal ceremony at the 2008 Summer Olympics with (from left to right): the Danish flag, the Union Flag of the UK, and the New Zealand flag The British Olympic Association, in its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, mentioned these games as \"the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings\".[23] The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.[87] The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Programme (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand.[114] Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50 million for a four-year membership.[115] Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the interlocking rings, in their publications and advertisements.[117]",

Moracinin: Politicinas have less environmental awareness than citizens MP Maja Moracinin, at the same time the new president of the political party DOM, at the #ActionIntegration conference spoke about the enduring efforts of the party, as the only green party, in the context of the connection between democracy, the rule of law, social justice, protection of human rights with green alternatives and sustainable development. Citizen activist Goce Markovski asked Moracinin whether she feels personal responsibility for the low level of environmental awareness among citizens on European and green values and also about what phase the procedure for the Law on mineral resources is in. The #ActionIntegration conference on European values, green alternatives and antinationalism was organized by CIVIL \u2013 Center for Freedom in cooperation with the Heinrich B\u1f45ll Foundation from Germany. The law is in the interest of protecting the environment and the health of the people, said Moracinin. At the last plenary session when it was put on the agenda, some of the MPs simply left the hall and there was no quorum for there to be voting\", stated Moracinin, hoping that at the next session the law will be put on the agenda and that it will receive the necessary support. Now we have an entirely different, much increased awareness among citizens...

One of the key elements of the MCL35M design is the integration of the Mercedes-AMG power unit, which has taken a considerable effort from the team in Woking, as well as our colleagues at Mercedes. Lando and Daniel will, I know, do their very best to represent the team out on track. Despite our limited scope for installation in a homologated car, the team has done a fantastic job of optimising our design work. Building a Formula 1 car is never easy. Every change to these regulations presents an opportunity, and the team in Woking has been working incredibly hard in difficult conditions to maximise those opportunities. This has been no small challenge, and I want to thank every member of our team, whether at the MTC or working remotely, for the massive effort they\u2019ve put in. Despite relatively stable technical regulations from 2020, there are several significant aerodynamic changes to the rules that are important to get right. I\u2019m really excited to be back working with the team ahead of my third season in Formula 1. The entire team has worked hard over the short winter, together with our colleagues from Mercedes-AMG, to produce the MCL35M and provide a strong car for our drivers to race this year.

The 50-year-old pastor spent two years in jail, facing a prison sentence of up to 35 years if convicted on both counts. However, the whole affair has revealed a willingness on the part of the United States to engage in hostage diplomacy with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's authoritarian government. In contrast to Brunson's case, the Trump administration has not shown the same level of interest in the case of two dual Turkish-American nationals and three foreign national US consulate employees facing similar trumped-up, terrorism-related charges in Turkey.

This assistance is channelled through the project Strengthening Social Dialogue, funded by the European Union and implemented by the International Labour Organization. Call for Concept Note Proposals: Grants for Modernizing of Existing and Developing New Services Offering quality services is fundamental in responding to members' needs, and retaining them, but also in broadening the organization's membership through the recruitment of new companies and members. Trade Unions are struggling to gain strength and momentum to create more prominent and representative organizations able to represent workers at national, sectoral and enterprise levels better, and there is a need for improvement of the scope and quality of their services toward the members as well as to make their work more visible to the public. This, in turn, can lead to increased representativeness of the social partners and their influence over social dialogue and policy regulation processes. To this end, the International Labour Organization assists the country in its endeavours to advance the social dialogue as an essential element of the European Social Model, which promotes competitiveness, sharing of gains and enhancing economic prosperity and social well-being. A number of progress reports by the European Commission indicate a need to further develop social dialogue among the social partners in North Macedonia. In addition, by creating space to grasp members' needs, identifying current issues and developing solutions, offering services becomes a way to support policy development and policy implementation and eventually feeds the EOs advocacy work. The overall objective of the Strengthening Social Dialogue Project is to improve social dialogue as a means to create more and better jobs. The ILO experience with Employers Organisations in CEE shows that their business model cannot be sustained long term if the revenue stream is based only on membership fees.",

The Center for development of SEPR, and of course, the municipalities will continue to work diligently to maximize the absorption of European funds and realize as many projects as possible, in order to provide a better and quality life for the citizens in the region \", pointed up Ms. Zhulieta Gjurkova, Head of the Center for Development of the South-East planning region in her address to the participants of the official event on the occasion of the signing of the co-financing agreements. With other words, if there was no national co-financing, municipalities and other institutions with lower financial capacity, the majority of non-governmental organizations and centers for development of the planning regions were not able to participate in the application and implementation of this type of project due to the inability to provide own participation. Agreements for co financing with the amount of 15% of the total value of the project were signed by the Minister of local self-government of Macedonia, Suhail Fazliu and the Head of the Center for development of the South-East planning region, Ms. Zhulieta Gjurkova.

As an example, the Center as an institution is financed from the budgets of the municipalities that are part of the South-East planning region and the Ministry of Local Self-Government only for the current costs and does not have an additional co-financing budget with which it could participate in the realization of larger projects. Agreements for co financing with the amount of 15% of the total value of the project were signed by the Minister of local self-government of Macedonia, Suhail Fazliu and the Head of the Center for development of the South-East planning region, Ms. Zhulieta Gjurkova. The benefits of implementing projects from EU funds adapted to regional needs and conditions are great because they lead to more balanced, territorially directed regional development, and in addition, through joint planning and implementation of projects in partnership with cross-border countries, cross-border relations that are strengthened, exchanging significant experiences.\t\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0434 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0434 \u0415\u0423 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0438, \u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0458\u045c\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u0434\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d, \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0458, \u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0442\u043e\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0441\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0458\u0438, \u0441\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0430\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0430\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0458\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. The projects realized by the Center for development of the South-East planning region aimed at improving the quality of life of the citizens of the South-East planning region through environmental protection, infrastructure development, as well as strengthening cross-border economic development. As an example, the Center as an institution is financed from the budgets of the municipalities that are part of the South-East planning region and the Ministry of Local Self-Government only for the current costs and does not have an additional co-financing budget with which it could participate in the realization of larger projects. Such cross-border projects could not be successfully implemented without national co-financing. Signed agreements for co-financing of the projects for cross-border cooperation between Macedonia and Greece On September 21, 2018, in the Government of the Republic of Macedonia were signed contracts for national co-financing of grants for 40 projects implemented through Interreg - EU IPA Cross Border Cooperation Program between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece, among which are the projects \"HELP - \"Integrated Operational Center for Humanitarian Aid\" and \"Combine2Protect\" - \"Common Strategies for the Protection of Biodiversity and Sustainable Development of the Bilateral Network of Protected Areas\", currently implemented by their project partners and the Center for Development of the South-East planning region.

Taxes discourage tobacco use A comprehensive ban on all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship could decrease tobacco consumption by an average of about 7%, with some countries experiencing a decline in consumption of up to 16%. In 2004, children accounted for 28% of the deaths attributable to second-hand smoke. Facilitate policy development by Member States and the globalization of plain packaging by providing informative, compelling and persuasive information. Tobacco tax revenues are on average 269 times higher than spending on tobacco control, based on available data. Studies carried out after the implementation of pictorial package warnings in Brazil, Canada, Singapore and Thailand consistently show that pictorial warnings significantly increase people's awareness of the harms of tobacco use. For World No Tobacco Day, 31 May 2016, WHO and the Secretariat of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control are calling countries to get ready for plain (standardized) packaging of tobacco products. While publicly stating its support for action against the illicit trade, the tobacco industry's behind-the-scenes behaviour has been very different. Eliminating illicit trade in tobacco will reduce the harmful consumption of tobacco by restricting availability of cheap, unregulated alternatives and increasing overall tobacco prices. Only 33 countries, with 10% of the world's population, have introduced taxes on tobacco products so that more than 75% of the retail price is tax. Even so, high tobacco taxes is a measure that is rarely implemented. Among smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most want to quit. Tobacco tax revenues are on average 269 times higher than spending on tobacco control, based on available data. Illicit trade of tobacco products must be stopped It also works to block implementation of tobacco control measures, such as tax increases and pictorial health warnings, by misleadingly arguing they will fuel the illicit trade. Tobacco taxes are the most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among young and poor people. In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. In infants, it causes sudden death. In pregnant women, it causes low birth weight. Only 42 countries, representing 19% of the world's population, meet the best practice for pictorial warnings, which includes the warnings in the local language and cover an average of at least half of the front and back of cigarette packs.

For more information contact: Smoke-free laws protect the health of non-smokers, are popular, do not harm business and encourage smokers to quit. Since then, it has become one of the most widely embraced treaties in the history of the United Nations with 180 Parties covering 90% of the world's population. Each MPOWER measure corresponds to at least 1 provision of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places. Bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship can reduce tobacco consumption. It is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of people to the highest standard of health, provides legal dimensions for international health cooperation and sets high standards for compliance. Stopping illicit trade in tobacco products is a health priority, and is achievable. Internal industry documents released as a result of court cases demonstrate that the tobacco industry has actively fostered the illicit trade globally.

Illicit trade of tobacco products must be stopped National comprehensive cessation services with full or partial cost-coverage are available to assist tobacco users to quit in only 24 countries, representing 15% of the world's population. Mass media campaigns can also reduce tobacco consumption by influencing people to protect non-smokers and convincing youths to stop using tobacco. There are more than 4000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, of which at least 250 are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer. For example, a 2009 survey in China revealed that only 38% of smokers knew that smoking causes coronary heart disease and only 27% knew that it causes stroke. In infants, it causes sudden death. Only 42 countries, representing 19% of the world's population, meet the best practice for pictorial warnings, which includes the warnings in the local language and cover an average of at least half of the front and back of cigarette packs.

The WHO FCTC Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products requires a wide range of measures relating to the tobacco supply chain, including the licensing of imports, exports and manufacture of tobacco products; the establishment of tracking and tracing systems and the imposition of penal sanctions on those responsible for illicit trade. More than 5 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while more than 600 000 are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. Graphic warnings can persuade smokers to protect the health of non-smokers by smoking less inside the home and avoiding smoking near children. Tobacco kills around 6 million people each year. A comprehensive ban on all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship could decrease tobacco consumption by an average of about 7%, with some countries experiencing a decline in consumption of up to 16%. Nearly 80% of the world's 1 billion smokers live in low- and middle-income countries. Each MPOWER measure corresponds to at least 1 provision of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Even so, high tobacco taxes is a measure that is rarely implemented. The illicit market is supported by various players, ranging from petty peddlers to organized criminal networks involved in arms and human trafficking. In December 2012, Australia became the first country to fully implement plain packaging. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by 10% decreases tobacco consumption by about 4% in high-income countries and about 5% in low- and middle-income countries. The illicit trade in tobacco products poses major health, economic and security concerns around the world. In some countries, children from poor households are frequently employed in tobacco farming to provide family income. Only 1 in 3 countries, representing one third of the world's population, monitors tobacco use by repeating nationally representative youth and adult surveys at least once every 5 years.

Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship Taxes discourage tobacco use More than 5 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while more than 600 000 are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. Good monitoring tracks the extent and character of the tobacco epidemic and indicates how best to tailor policies. Plain packaging of tobacco products refers to measures that restrict or prohibit the use of logos, colours, brand images or promotional information on packaging other than brand names and product names displayed in a standard colour and font style. Every year, on 31 May, WHO and partners mark World No Tobacco Day (WNTD), highlighting the health risks associated with tobacco use and advocating for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. For example, a 2009 survey in China revealed that only 38% of smokers knew that smoking causes coronary heart disease and only 27% knew that it causes stroke. Over 1.3 billion people, or 18% of the world's population, are protected by comprehensive national smoke-free laws. The WHO Framework Convention is WHO's most important tobacco control tool and a milestone in the promotion of public health. Plain packaging is an important demand reduction measure that reduces the attractiveness of tobacco products, restricts use of tobacco packaging as a form of tobacco advertising and promotion, limits misleading packaging and labelling, and increases the effectiveness of health warnings. Second-hand smoke causes more than 600 000 premature deaths per year. The WHO FCTC Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products requires a wide range of measures relating to the tobacco supply chain, including the licensing of imports, exports and manufacture of tobacco products; the establishment of tracking and tracing systems and the imposition of penal sanctions on those responsible for illicit trade. Mass media campaigns can also reduce tobacco consumption by influencing people to protect non-smokers and convincing youths to stop using tobacco. Most of these countries are low- or middle-income countries. Surveillance is key Studies show that few people understand the specific health risks of tobacco use. Studies carried out after the implementation of pictorial package warnings in Brazil, Canada, Singapore and Thailand consistently show that pictorial warnings significantly increase people's awareness of the harms of tobacco use. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control entered into force in February 2005. Since then, it has become one of the most widely embraced treaties in the history of the United Nations with 180 Parties covering 90% of the world's population. In 2015, Ireland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and France all passed laws to implement plain packaging from May 2016. Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship Raise taxes on tobacco. Second-hand smoke is the smoke that fills restaurants, offices or other enclosed spaces when people burn tobacco products such as cigarettes, bidis and water-pipes. Counselling and medication can more than double the chance that a smoker who tries to quit will succeed. It would also criminalize illicit production and cross-border smuggling. Almost half of children regularly breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke in public places. Hard-hitting anti-tobacco advertisements and graphic pack warnings \u2013 especially those that include pictures \u2013 reduce the number of children who begin smoking and increase the number of smokers who quit.

        "text":"Because space does not need to be left for a mirror, the camera and lens system overall can be made shorter and more compact. The refractive power of the lenses was increased to maximise the ability of each lens and shorten the overall length, Mr Shinohara explains. \"Of course this also affects image quality, so we proactively incorporated new glass materials such as Super UD lenses and UD aspherical lenses for chromatic aberration and spherical aberration correction.\" To make the most of this advantage, the design team took the decision early on to use a variable overall length design instead of the more conventional inner zoom construction of the Canon EF 70-200mm f\/2.8L IS III USM. The developers succeeded in producing a Nano USM that can deal with the long stroke of a telephoto lens while maintaining a small size and fast AF performance. Electronic floating focus control The Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM is the first Canon lens to use electronic floating focus control with two Nano USM units. The electronic floating focus control, a Canon first, improves close-up image quality and shortens the minimum focusing distance to just 0.7m, as compared to 1.2m for the Canon EF 70-200mm f\/2.8L IS III USM. One of the key design priorities behind the Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM was to produce a pro-quality lens in a compact form \u2013 a lighter-weight telephoto zoom ideal for handheld shooting, which professionals could more easily take anywhere, particularly in their carry-on luggage. L-series durability, reliability, dust and water resistance \"This lens is designed for reliability and durability that is equal to or surpasses the Canon EF 70-200mm f\/2.8L IS III USM,\" Mr Okuda says. Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM developers interview Independent operation of the focusing lens group and floating lens group reduces the minimum focusing distance for improved close-up shooting and delivers further AF precision improvements. To save weight, the Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM lens comes with a removable tripod mount ring, so you can leave the tripod mount at home when it isn't needed. It is significantly shorter and lighter, perfectly complementing the compact Canon EOS R body with the world's smallest professional 70-200mm f\/2.8 zoom. Photographer Matthew Joseph on using Canon's f\/2.8 trinity RF lenses, covering ultra-wide, standard and telephoto zoom ranges, to shoot action. In fact, \"the heat insulating properties of this coating are better than on the equivalent EF lens.\" Thanks to the RF mount, the lens always receives power when connected to the camera, enabling the designers to solve this issue. In addition to outstanding image quality and the legendary L-series build and reliability, it incorporates pioneering technologies and technical innovations for state-of-the-art speed and performance.",

The 2019 theme is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) and focuses on pathways of coping with existing \u2013 and preventing future \u2013 old age inequalities. Older people have always played a significant role in society as leaders, caretakers and custodians of tradition. The International Day of Older Persons is an opportunity to highlight the important contributions that older people make to society and raise awareness of the opportunities and challenges of ageing in today's world. Moreover, this increase will be the greatest and most rapid in the developing world Population ageing is poised to become one of the most significant social transformations of the 21st century. With healthy aging, more precisely by preventing those processes and actions that accelerate aging, opportunities are created for living as long as possible with active physical and mental life. The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognize that development will only be achievable if it is inclusive of all ages. Between 2015 and 2030, the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to increase from 901 million to 1.4 billion. Explore societal and structural changes in view of life course policies: life-long learning, proactive and adaptive labour policies, social protection and universal health coverage. International Day of Older Persons-1 October Between 2017 and 2030, the number of persons aged 60 years or over is projected to grow by 46 per cent (from 962 million to 1.4 billion) globally outnumbering youth, as well as children under the age of 10. The 2019 theme aims to: Draw attention to the existence of old age inequalities and how this often results from a cumulation of disadvantages throughout life, and highlight intergenerational risk of increased old age inequalities. 2019 Theme: \"The Journey to Age Equality\" Yet they are also highly vulnerable, with many falling into poverty, becoming disabled or facing discrimination. For now, it has been proven with certainty that in the absence of disease, weight regulation and controlled physical activity greatly enhance the quality of life of the adult population. Bring awareness to the urgency of coping with existing \u2013 and preventing future \u2013 old age inequalities. Their needs are also growing, as are their contributions to the world. In the Republic of North Macedonia the burden of chronic diseases covers a wide range of negative health consequences. In this regard, trends of ageing and economic inequality interact across generations and rapid population ageing, demographic and societal or structural changes alone, can exacerbate older age inequalities, thereby limiting economic growth and social cohesion. Reflect on best practices, lessons and progress on the journey to ending older age inequalities and changing negative narratives and stereotypes involving \"old age\" In the Republic of North Macedonia, the phenomenon of regional aging of the rural population is typical due to the intensive migration of the young productive population in the rural-urban direction. As health care improves, the population of older people is growing. SDG 10 sets to reduce inequality within \u2013 and among \u2013 countries, and aims to \"ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome,\" including through measures to eliminate discrimination, and to \"empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status.\" In the Republic of North Macedonia out of the total population, the number of elderly in 2015 was 264,964, while the number of elderly in 2017 increased to 272,234.",

During the afternoon session, the Parliament confirmed the need for adopting the proposed amendments to the laws for one-off writing off of debts of citizens, Insurance Supervision Law, Law on Foreign Exchange Inspection, Law on Financial Companies and Law on Registering Cash Payments. Fiscal implications that will be caused by this legal solution will amount to Denar 380 million on annual basis. Modifications and amendments to the Law will enter into force in ten or so days when the Law is published in the Official Gazette. Skopje, 10th July 2014 (MIA) \u2013 Yesterday, Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, within the eighth session, determined the need for adopting the modifications and amendments to the Law on VAT, envisaging reduction of the Value Added Tax rate from 18% to 5% for baby products, school supplies, fodder, fodder additives and livestock. The Law, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Zoran Stavreski said, contains significant amendment to the end of supporting the living standard of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, especially to young families having school-age children or babies, as well as support to farmers and cattle breeders, mainly, as response to one of their long-standing request. The expenditures of the families and cattle breeders will be reduced, which we believe it is the best and most direct possible manner of supporting young families having school-age children, families with several children will especially feel the benefits therefrom since they will save several thousand denars per month, Stavreski said. \u2013 Given the direct benefits for large number of citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, I believe this Law will be supported by the Members of the Parliament, he said. Home Stavreski: Reduced VAT rates support to the living standard of citizens Families with newborn baby will feel the benefits when buying crib, baby stroller and everything they use for babies. All this, as he stressed, is aimed at increasing competitiveness of Macedonian agriculture and Macedonian stock-breeders. \u2013 It is a matter of Law, proposing VAT reduction from 18% to 5% for three categories of products, those being: Fodder, fodder additives and livestock.

Saso Jovanovski joins InCom as Managing Partner Without hesitation I accepted the offer of partnership and working together on the market, because the proposal coincides with my understanding of the business \u2013 the synergy of expertise, experience, dedication will always bring more value and success than individual action in the market. This partnership coincides with the fourth anniversary of InCom. Saso Jovanovski \u2013 new InCom partner There is a surplus of software solutions, but a large deficit for quality customer support.

        "text":"Taking into account the purposes for which the amendments to Article 8-a of the Electoral Code were adopted \u2013 which are to separate the state from the party and prevent the misuse of public money during the elections, it appears that in this provision the legislator should have determined the illegal, that is, prohibited forms of disposal with budget funds, and not any disposal with budget funds, because the payment of salaries or pensions, for example, is a form of disposal with or use of public money, which is allowed disposal with budget resources or public funds. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. With the same resolution the Court suspended the execution of the actions taken based on the challenged provisions noted in the above laws. The Court also found that under Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. The contested ban on paying subsidies questions the realisation of the legitimate expectations of this category of citizens who have already invested in agricultural production and legitimately expect that some of the invested money and capital will be returned via subsidies. Subsidies in agriculture are regulated in the Law on Agriculture and Rural Development (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" nos.49\/2010, 53\/2011, 126\/2012, 15\/2013, 106\/2013, 177\/2014, 25\/2015, 73\/2015, 83\/2015, 154\/2015, 11\/2016, 53\/2016, 120\/2016 and 163\/2016). Article 3 of this Law defines the objectives of national agricultural policy which are aimed at: Apart from the Venice Commission and the OSCE, the issue of misuse of administrative resources during elections (more in terms of regional and local elections) is also dealt with by the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. Under paragraph 2 line 1 of the same Article of the Code, in the period of 20 days before the start of the election campaign until the conclusion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: (5) The Minister of Finance, who shall not submit or on the website of the Ministry of Finance shall not post the election financial report two weeks after the announcement of the elections which will include an overview of all projected and realised revenues and expenditures from the Budget by items, in the period from the beginning of the fiscal year to the date of submission of the report, pursuant to the Electoral Code, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. With the establishment of the ban on payment of subsidies only that are not regular monthly payments, these beneficiaries of state aid are put in an unequal position with other users of state aid, as a result of which the challenged provision is not in accordance either with the constitutional principle of equality of citizens under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. The period in which the prohibitions of Article 8-a paragraph 1 are valid is the one from the adoption of the decision to call elections to the completion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the electoral results, and from the date of the decision to call elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, except for the prohibitions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which commence 20 days before the start of the electoral campaign. Apart from the Venice Commission and the OSCE, the issue of misuse of administrative resources during elections (more in terms of regional and local elections) is also dealt with by the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. Citizens before the Constitution and the laws are equal. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. (4) The Minister of Finance who from the day the of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of the President, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, according to the election results, as well as from the date of the adoption of the decision to announce elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje shall not publicly post on the website, in specific base for budget spending, all budget payments, except regular salaries, pensions and utilities expenses, pursuant to law, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year.

Hence, the ban on the payment of subsidies which is prescribed in the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, according to the Court, is a limitation of the rights of citizens who are beneficiaries of subsidies and who acquire this right on the basis of fulfillment of certain conditions and in a procedure prescribed by law. \u2013 be disposed with budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, funds of the budget of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and funds of public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities disposing with state capital. However, from the wording of the contested provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 it arises that with it the legislator established as inadmissible any disposal with budget funds and public funds, that is, did not establish illegal disposal in it. Decision U.no.35\/2017 There should be sanctions for misuse of administrative resources and they should be implemented.\" (3) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code the organizes the holding of a public event marking the start of construction or commissioning of the facility from means from the Budget or public funds or assets from public enterprises or other legal entities managing state capital, in infrastructure such as roads, water supply systems, power lines, sewers, sports playgrounds and other facilities or facilities for social activities, schools, kindergartens and other facilities, shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to one year. (5) The Minister of Finance, who shall not submit or on the website of the Ministry of Finance shall not post the election financial report two weeks after the announcement of the elections which will include an overview of all projected and realised revenues and expenditures from the Budget by items, in the period from the beginning of the fiscal year to the date of submission of the report, pursuant to the Electoral Code, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. (1) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code begins construction with funds from the Budget or from public funds or assets of public companies and other legal entities managing state capital of new facilities in infrastructure such as roads, water supply systems, power lines, sewers, playgrounds and other facilities or facilities for social activities, schools, kindergartens and other facilities, if for that purpose no funds have been provided previously from the budget, that is, it is no work on the realisation of a programme adopted on the basis of law in the current year, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. There is no legal definition of the notion disposal with budget funds in the Budgets Law and the laws on execution of budgets that are adopted each year, or in other laws in the financial field. Everyone is obliged to observe the Constitution and the laws. According to the Court's assessment, the contested provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code does not establish in a clear and precise manner which disposal with budgetary resources during the election process is considered illegal and as such prohibited. Thereby, neither did the legislator in this provision nor in any other provision of this Code or any other law define the term disposal with budget funds. (4) The Minister of Finance who from the day the of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of the President, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, according to the election results, as well as from the date of the adoption of the decision to announce elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje shall not publicly post on the website, in specific base for budget spending, all budget payments, except regular salaries, pensions and utilities expenses, pursuant to law, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. The content of the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, analysed in terms of the requirements and recommendations contained in these international documents, it appears that the legal provisions to prevent abuse of public resources during elections should make a clear and precise distinction between permissible and illegal disposal of budget funds. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Decision U.no.35\/2017 On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 17 May 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following From the analysis of the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 it appears that it prohibits the disposal of budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, means from the budgets of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and funds of public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities disposing with state capital. With the same resolution the Court suspended the execution of the actions taken based on the challenged provisions noted in the above laws. The content of the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, analysed in terms of the requirements and recommendations contained in these international documents, it appears that the legal provisions to prevent abuse of public resources during elections should make a clear and precise distinction between permissible and illegal disposal of budget funds. On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 17 May 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following The reasoning of the Proposed Law states that these amendments to the Electoral Code are continuation of the reform of electoral legislation in order to improve the legislation in line with the comparative analysis of European legislation, and to provide appropriate activities for consistent implementation of election-related legislation. (4) The Minister of Finance who from the day the of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of the President, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, according to the election results, as well as from the date of the adoption of the decision to announce elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje shall not publicly post on the website, in specific base for budget spending, all budget payments, except regular salaries, pensions and utilities expenses, pursuant to law, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. Article 165-c of the Criminal Code is entitled \"Unlawful disposal with budget funds during elections.\" Pursuant to Article 9 of the Constitution, citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights regardless of sex, race, colour, national and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property and social status. Citizens before the Constitution and the laws are equal. Taking into account the purposes for which the amendments to Article 8-a of the Electoral Code were adopted \u2013 which are to separate the state from the party and prevent the misuse of public money during the elections, it appears that in this provision the legislator should have determined the illegal, that is, prohibited forms of disposal with budget funds, and not any disposal with budget funds, because the payment of salaries or pensions, for example, is a form of disposal with or use of public money, which is allowed disposal with budget resources or public funds. Section 1.1. of the Joint Guidelines indicates that \"the legal framework should provide for a general prohibition of abuse of administrative resources during the election process. (3) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code the organizes the holding of a public event marking the start of construction or commissioning of the facility from means from the Budget or public funds or assets from public enterprises or other legal entities managing state capital, in infrastructure such as roads, water supply systems, power lines, sewers, sports playgrounds and other facilities or facilities for social activities, schools, kindergartens and other facilities, shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to one year. (4) The Minister of Finance who from the day the of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of the President, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, according to the election results, as well as from the date of the adoption of the decision to announce elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje shall not publicly post on the website, in specific base for budget spending, all budget payments, except regular salaries, pensions and utilities expenses, pursuant to law, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Constitution, citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights regardless of sex, race, colour, national and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property and social status. Moreover, the Court considers as founded the allegations noted in the initiative that in the challenged provision the prohibition applies to beneficiaries of subsidies only, not mentioning other types of payments for other categories of citizens, such as beneficiaries of scholarships for pupils and students. Upon the application of the Regional Association of Winegrowers from Tikvesh area \"Agrotikveshija 2002\" from Kavadarci, through the president Ljupcho Arizanov, with its Resolution U.br.35\/2017 dated 10 May 2017 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions of the laws in item 1 of this decision. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. (5) The Minister of Finance, who shall not submit or on the website of the Ministry of Finance shall not post the election financial report two weeks after the announcement of the elections which will include an overview of all projected and realised revenues and expenditures from the Budget by items, in the period from the beginning of the fiscal year to the date of submission of the report, pursuant to the Electoral Code, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. Thus, long-term projects or urgent measures must be distinguished from government activities related mainly to the election campaign. Moreover, the Court considers as founded the allegations noted in the initiative that in the challenged provision the prohibition applies to beneficiaries of subsidies only, not mentioning other types of payments for other categories of citizens, such as beneficiaries of scholarships for pupils and students. Subsidies in agriculture are regulated in the Law on Agriculture and Rural Development (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" nos.49\/2010, 53\/2011, 126\/2012, 15\/2013, 106\/2013, 177\/2014, 25\/2015, 73\/2015, 83\/2015, 154\/2015, 11\/2016, 53\/2016, 120\/2016 and 163\/2016). Moreover, the Court considers as founded the allegations noted in the initiative that in the challenged provision the prohibition applies to beneficiaries of subsidies only, not mentioning other types of payments for other categories of citizens, such as beneficiaries of scholarships for pupils and students. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Constitution, citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights regardless of sex, race, colour, national and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property and social status. The Court also found that under Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Item 10 of the report states that: \"The report clearly distinguishes between the use and abuse of administrative resources. In item 28 it is indicated that the rules to prevent the abuse of administrative resources must be analysed in terms of their impact on the necessary continuity and efficiency of government operations. \u2013 Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. While the former are generally acceptable, even necessary, the measures that mainly concern the campaign should be prevented.\" Paragraph 2 of this Article of the Law stipulates that the aims of paragraph (1) of this Article shall be implemented through measures and policy instruments for: 1) arranging and supporting agricultural markets, 2) direct payments, and 3) rural development Paragraph 2 of this Article of the Law stipulates that the aims of paragraph (1) of this Article shall be implemented through measures and policy instruments for: 1) arranging and supporting agricultural markets, 2) direct payments, and 3) rural development Considering that Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law regulates the same issue as the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, in relation to this Article the Court also finds that it is not in accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. From the wording of the provision of Article 165-c of the Criminal Code it arises that no provision of this article the very disposal with budgetary resources (as formulated in Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1) is not defined as a crime or special form of crime, but the specifically defined activities are prescribed as a crime (in the other lines of Article 8-a) which are regarded as illegal or unlawful disposal of budget funds. In respect of Article 8-a, the reasoning of the Proposed Law states that the purpose of the amendment of Article 8-a is to fulfill the recommendation to separate the state from the party. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. Citizens before the Constitution and the laws are equal. This Decision shall generate legal effects from the date of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\". The ban should be determined in a clear and predictable manner. (2) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code makes payment of salaries, pensions, subsidies, social benefits or other payments and material benefits from the budget or from public funds that are not regular monthly payments, that is, all annual transfers and payments or one-time transfers from the budget or from public funds or misappropriation of state capital or signing collective agreements, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to five years. With the establishment of the ban on payment of subsidies only that are not regular monthly payments, these beneficiaries of state aid are put in an unequal position with other users of state aid, as a result of which the challenged provision is not in accordance either with the constitutional principle of equality of citizens under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Thereby, neither did the legislator in this provision nor in any other provision of this Code or any other law define the term disposal with budget funds. In respect of Article 8-a, the reasoning of the Proposed Law states that the purpose of the amendment of Article 8-a is to fulfill the recommendation to separate the state from the party. The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. The decision to stop the execution of the actions taken based on the provisions of the laws noted in item 1 of this Decision SHALL BE PUT OUT OF EFFECT. On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 17 May 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Item 10 of the report states that: \"The report clearly distinguishes between the use and abuse of administrative resources. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. The decision to stop the execution of the actions taken based on the provisions of the laws noted in item 1 of this Decision SHALL BE PUT OUT OF EFFECT.

There should be sanctions for misuse of administrative resources and they should be implemented.\" The Court also found that under Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. (4) The Minister of Finance who from the day the of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of the President, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, according to the election results, as well as from the date of the adoption of the decision to announce elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje shall not publicly post on the website, in specific base for budget spending, all budget payments, except regular salaries, pensions and utilities expenses, pursuant to law, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. From the title and content of this document it follows that it regulates the misuse of administrative resources during elections, not every form of their use. On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 17 May 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. The use of resources should be permitted by law; it implies a legal possibility to use administrative resources during the election process for the proper functioning of the institutions, provided that such use is not for the purposes of the campaign. While the former are generally acceptable, even necessary, the measures that mainly concern the campaign should be prevented.\" Apart from the Venice Commission and the OSCE, the issue of misuse of administrative resources during elections (more in terms of regional and local elections) is also dealt with by the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. The proceedings was instigated as there was a reasonable question raised before the Court with regard to the accordance of the challenged articles with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. The Joint Guidelines for preventing and responding to the misuse of administrative resources during electoral processes \u2013 Document CDL-AD(2016)004 of 14 March 2016, adopted jointly by the Council of Europe Venice Commission and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights \u2013 ODIHR, note the rule of law as one of the basic principles that are essential to prevent the misuse of administrative resources during the electoral process. Regarding the definition of \"misuse of public resources\" it states that it is widely accepted that it covers the unlawful conduct of public officials, political candidates and parties in power to use their official position or relationship with government institutions in order to influence the outcome of the election. \u2013 be disposed with budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, funds of the budget of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and funds of public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities disposing with state capital.

The Court also found that under Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Everyone is obliged to observe the Constitution and the laws. Apart from the Venice Commission and the OSCE, the issue of misuse of administrative resources during elections (more in terms of regional and local elections) is also dealt with by the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. The Court also found that under Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Moreover, the Court considers as founded the allegations noted in the initiative that in the challenged provision the prohibition applies to beneficiaries of subsidies only, not mentioning other types of payments for other categories of citizens, such as beneficiaries of scholarships for pupils and students. With the establishment of the ban on payment of subsidies only that are not regular monthly payments, these beneficiaries of state aid are put in an unequal position with other users of state aid, as a result of which the challenged provision is not in accordance either with the constitutional principle of equality of citizens under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Article 3 of this Law defines the objectives of national agricultural policy which are aimed at: There is no legal definition of the notion disposal with budget funds in the Budgets Law and the laws on execution of budgets that are adopted each year, or in other laws in the financial field. From the content of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code it arises that it defines to be illegal that is prohibited certain activities related to the use of public resources in order to prevent the misuse of public resources during the election process (disposing with budget funds, starting construction of infrastructure facilities such as roads, water supply systems, power lines, etc. There is no legal definition of the notion disposal with budget funds in the Budgets Law and the laws on execution of budgets that are adopted each year, or in other laws in the financial field. \u2013 Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. The document entitled \"Abuse of administrative resources during the electoral process: the role of local and regional elected representatives and public officials\" in item 27 states: \"The prohibition of abuse of state resources is aimed at protecting the integrity of the electoral process and providing field for fair competition for all participants. From the analysis of the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 it appears that it prohibits the disposal of budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, means from the budgets of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and funds of public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities disposing with state capital. Thereby, neither did the legislator in this provision nor in any other provision of this Code or any other law define the term disposal with budget funds. Subsidies for which the Law uses the term direct payments, in Article 47 are defined as a measure to support the income of agricultural holdings and purchasers of agricultural products registered in the register of Article 33 of this Law. At its session the Court found that under Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos.40\/2006, 136\/2008, 148\/2008, 155\/2008, 163\/2008, 44\/2011, 51\/2011, 142\/2012, 31\/2013, 34\/2013, 14\/2014, 30\/2014, 196\/2015, 35\/2016, 97\/2016, 99\/2016, 136\/2016 and 142\/2016), from the date of the adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the results of the elections, and from the date of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or members of the council, that is, until the constitution of the Council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: With the same resolution the Court suspended the execution of the actions taken based on the challenged provisions noted in the above laws. According to the Court's assessment, the contested provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code does not establish in a clear and precise manner which disposal with budgetary resources during the election process is considered illegal and as such prohibited. From the said content of Article 165-c of the Criminal Code, which sanctions the unlawful disposal of budget funds during elections, it appears that in different paragraphs of this article the legislator has established special forms of committing this crime with a description of the specific actions of commission corresponding to the prohibitions set out in Article 8-a paragraph 1, lines 2 and 3, paragraph 2 lines 1 and 2 and paragraphs 3 and 4 of the same article of the Electoral Code. Under paragraph 2 line 1 of the same Article of the Code, in the period of 20 days before the start of the election campaign until the conclusion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: \u2013 be paid subsidies that are not regular monthly payments. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. The legislator established the illegal forms of disposal in other lines of this article of the Electoral Code (Article 8-a paragraph 1 lines 2, 3 and 4) with prohibition of for instance the commencement of construction of infrastructure facilities, extraordinary payments of salaries and pensions, employment of new people in state and public institutions, and so on. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Considering that Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law regulates the same issue as the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, in relation to this Article the Court also finds that it is not in accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. This interpretation of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code derives also from Article 165-c of the Criminal Code in which violations of the provisions of Article 8-a are defined as crimes. Hence, the ban on the payment of subsidies which is prescribed in the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, according to the Court, is a limitation of the rights of citizens who are beneficiaries of subsidies and who acquire this right on the basis of fulfillment of certain conditions and in a procedure prescribed by law. Hence, the ban on the payment of subsidies which is prescribed in the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, according to the Court, is a limitation of the rights of citizens who are beneficiaries of subsidies and who acquire this right on the basis of fulfillment of certain conditions and in a procedure prescribed by law. From what has been noted it arises that subsidies represent economic budget transfers that primarily aim to encourage the development of certain economic activities through direct payments to the subjects performing those activities (ex. farmers). Although their purpose is primarily economic, there is no doubt that as a form of material assistance they also have a social function to protect the standard of certain categories of citizens who are their beneficiaries. Hence, the ban on the payment of subsidies which is prescribed in the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, according to the Court, is a limitation of the rights of citizens who are beneficiaries of subsidies and who acquire this right on the basis of fulfillment of certain conditions and in a procedure prescribed by law. This Decision shall generate legal effects from the date of its publication in the \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\". By contrast, abuse of public resources should be sanctioned by law because of the unlawful use of public resources by those in power and state officials for campaign purposes.\" This view of the Court is corroborated and is in line with international standards pertaining to this issue. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. Upon the application of the Regional Association of Winegrowers from Tikvesh area \"Agrotikveshija 2002\" from Kavadarci, through the president Ljupcho Arizanov, with its Resolution U.br.35\/2017 dated 10 May 2017 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions of the laws in item 1 of this decision. Pursuant to Article 61 of the Law, the payment of direct payments may not be made before it is determined that the user fulfills the conditions for granting direct payments. On the basis of what has been noted, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of the present Decision. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. The decision to stop the execution of the actions taken based on the provisions of the laws noted in item 1 of this Decision SHALL BE PUT OUT OF EFFECT. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. Upon the application of the Regional Association of Winegrowers from Tikvesh area \"Agrotikveshija 2002\" from Kavadarci, through the president Ljupcho Arizanov, with its Resolution U.br.35\/2017 dated 10 May 2017 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions of the laws in item 1 of this decision. Under paragraph 2 line 1 of the same Article of the Code, in the period of 20 days before the start of the election campaign until the conclusion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: \u2013 be paid subsidies that are not regular monthly payments. With the same resolution the Court suspended the execution of the actions taken based on the challenged provisions noted in the above laws. Considering that Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law regulates the same issue as the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, in relation to this Article the Court also finds that it is not in accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. With the same resolution the Court suspended the execution of the actions taken based on the challenged provisions noted in the above laws. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Paragraph 2 of this Article of the Law stipulates that the aims of paragraph (1) of this Article shall be implemented through measures and policy instruments for: 1) arranging and supporting agricultural markets, 2) direct payments, and 3) rural development \u2013 Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. (3) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code the organizes the holding of a public event marking the start of construction or commissioning of the facility from means from the Budget or public funds or assets from public enterprises or other legal entities managing state capital, in infrastructure such as roads, water supply systems, power lines, sewers, sports playgrounds and other facilities or facilities for social activities, schools, kindergartens and other facilities, shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to one year. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. In respect of Article 8-a, the reasoning of the Proposed Law states that the purpose of the amendment of Article 8-a is to fulfill the recommendation to separate the state from the party. Subsidies for which the Law uses the term direct payments, in Article 47 are defined as a measure to support the income of agricultural holdings and purchasers of agricultural products registered in the register of Article 33 of this Law. Hence, the ban on the payment of subsidies which is prescribed in the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, according to the Court, is a limitation of the rights of citizens who are beneficiaries of subsidies and who acquire this right on the basis of fulfillment of certain conditions and in a procedure prescribed by law. \u2013 Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. Thus, long-term projects or urgent measures must be distinguished from government activities related mainly to the election campaign. The use of resources should be permitted by law; it implies a legal possibility to use administrative resources during the election process for the proper functioning of the institutions, provided that such use is not for the purposes of the campaign. On the basis of what has been noted, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of the present Decision. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Citizens before the Constitution and the laws are equal. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Subsidies for which the Law uses the term direct payments, in Article 47 are defined as a measure to support the income of agricultural holdings and purchasers of agricultural products registered in the register of Article 33 of this Law. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Constitution, citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights regardless of sex, race, colour, national and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property and social status. Considering that Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law regulates the same issue as the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, in relation to this Article the Court also finds that it is not in accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. It is a complex phenomenon due to the heavy line of demarcation between the use of state resources in the legitimate performance of government functions and actions constitute abuse of those resources and giving an unfair advantage to the party in power.\" The content of the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, analysed in terms of the requirements and recommendations contained in these international documents, it appears that the legal provisions to prevent abuse of public resources during elections should make a clear and precise distinction between permissible and illegal disposal of budget funds. Upon the application of the Regional Association of Winegrowers from Tikvesh area \"Agrotikveshija 2002\" from Kavadarci, through the president Ljupcho Arizanov, with its Resolution U.br.35\/2017 dated 10 May 2017 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions of the laws in item 1 of this decision. The amount of direct payments referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be determined depending on the type of crop, type, class and quality of agricultural products and livestock. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. On the basis of what has been noted, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of the present Decision. Article 165-c of the Criminal Code is entitled \"Unlawful disposal with budget funds during elections.\" At its session the Court found that under Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos.40\/2006, 136\/2008, 148\/2008, 155\/2008, 163\/2008, 44\/2011, 51\/2011, 142\/2012, 31\/2013, 34\/2013, 14\/2014, 30\/2014, 196\/2015, 35\/2016, 97\/2016, 99\/2016, 136\/2016 and 142\/2016), from the date of the adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the results of the elections, and from the date of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or members of the council, that is, until the constitution of the Council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: Although their purpose is primarily economic, there is no doubt that as a form of material assistance they also have a social function to protect the standard of certain categories of citizens who are their beneficiaries. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. According to the Court's assessment, the contested provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code does not establish in a clear and precise manner which disposal with budgetary resources during the election process is considered illegal and as such prohibited. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Considering that Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law regulates the same issue as the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, in relation to this Article the Court also finds that it is not in accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Article 165-c of the Criminal Code is entitled \"Unlawful disposal with budget funds during elections.\" On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 17 May 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following From the analysis of the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 it appears that it prohibits the disposal of budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, means from the budgets of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and funds of public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities disposing with state capital. Under paragraph 2 line 1 of the same Article of the Code, in the period of 20 days before the start of the election campaign until the conclusion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: With the same resolution the Court suspended the execution of the actions taken based on the challenged provisions noted in the above laws. The Court took the present decision by a majority vote in the following composition: Mr Nikola Ivanovski, President of the Court, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mrs Elena Gosheva, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mr Jovan Josifovski, Mrs Vangelina Markudova, Mr Sali Murati, Dr Gzime Starova and Mr Vladimir Stojanoski. The decision to stop the execution of the actions taken based on the provisions of the laws noted in item 1 of this Decision SHALL BE PUT OUT OF EFFECT. Moreover, the Court considers as founded the allegations noted in the initiative that in the challenged provision the prohibition applies to beneficiaries of subsidies only, not mentioning other types of payments for other categories of citizens, such as beneficiaries of scholarships for pupils and students. Pursuant to Article 61 of the Law, the payment of direct payments may not be made before it is determined that the user fulfills the conditions for granting direct payments. On the basis of what has been noted, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of the present Decision. Pursuant to Article 61 of the Law, the payment of direct payments may not be made before it is determined that the user fulfills the conditions for granting direct payments. The period in which the prohibitions of Article 8-a paragraph 1 are valid is the one from the adoption of the decision to call elections to the completion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the electoral results, and from the date of the decision to call elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, except for the prohibitions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which commence 20 days before the start of the electoral campaign. Upon the application of the Regional Association of Winegrowers from Tikvesh area \"Agrotikveshija 2002\" from Kavadarci, through the president Ljupcho Arizanov, with its Resolution U.br.35\/2017 dated 10 May 2017 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions of the laws in item 1 of this decision. On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 17 May 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 17 May 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. The period in which the prohibitions of Article 8-a paragraph 1 are valid is the one from the adoption of the decision to call elections to the completion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the electoral results, and from the date of the decision to call elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, except for the prohibitions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which commence 20 days before the start of the electoral campaign. 28\/2002, 46\/2004, 126\/2006, 10\/2008, 161\/2008, 145\/2010, 97\/2015 and 148\/2015) from the adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the end of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, and the Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the election of mayors and council members of municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not be use of budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, means from the budgets of municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities managing state capital, unless otherwise provided by law that regulates electoral campaign financing of political parties. This interpretation of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code derives also from Article 165-c of the Criminal Code in which violations of the provisions of Article 8-a are defined as crimes. According to the Court's assessment, the contested provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code does not establish in a clear and precise manner which disposal with budgetary resources during the election process is considered illegal and as such prohibited. \u2013 be disposed with budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, funds of the budget of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and funds of public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities disposing with state capital. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Constitution, citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights regardless of sex, race, colour, national and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property and social status. On the basis of Articles 110 and 112 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and Article 70 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 17 May 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia took the following At its session the Court found that under Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos.40\/2006, 136\/2008, 148\/2008, 155\/2008, 163\/2008, 44\/2011, 51\/2011, 142\/2012, 31\/2013, 34\/2013, 14\/2014, 30\/2014, 196\/2015, 35\/2016, 97\/2016, 99\/2016, 136\/2016 and 142\/2016), from the date of the adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the results of the elections, and from the date of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or members of the council, that is, until the constitution of the Council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: Hence, the ban on the payment of subsidies which is prescribed in the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, according to the Court, is a limitation of the rights of citizens who are beneficiaries of subsidies and who acquire this right on the basis of fulfillment of certain conditions and in a procedure prescribed by law. (4) The Minister of Finance who from the day the of adoption of the decision on announcing elections to the completion of the election of the President, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, according to the election results, as well as from the date of the adoption of the decision to announce elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje shall not publicly post on the website, in specific base for budget spending, all budget payments, except regular salaries, pensions and utilities expenses, pursuant to law, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. In respect of Article 8-a, the reasoning of the Proposed Law states that the purpose of the amendment of Article 8-a is to fulfill the recommendation to separate the state from the party. According to the Court's assessment, the contested provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code does not establish in a clear and precise manner which disposal with budgetary resources during the election process is considered illegal and as such prohibited. (1) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code begins construction with funds from the Budget or from public funds or assets of public companies and other legal entities managing state capital of new facilities in infrastructure such as roads, water supply systems, power lines, sewers, playgrounds and other facilities or facilities for social activities, schools, kindergartens and other facilities, if for that purpose no funds have been provided previously from the budget, that is, it is no work on the realisation of a programme adopted on the basis of law in the current year, shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to one year. (2) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code makes payment of salaries, pensions, subsidies, social benefits or other payments and material benefits from the budget or from public funds that are not regular monthly payments, that is, all annual transfers and payments or one-time transfers from the budget or from public funds or misappropriation of state capital or signing collective agreements, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to five years. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. Taking into account the purposes for which the amendments to Article 8-a of the Electoral Code were adopted \u2013 which are to separate the state from the party and prevent the misuse of public money during the elections, it appears that in this provision the legislator should have determined the illegal, that is, prohibited forms of disposal with budget funds, and not any disposal with budget funds, because the payment of salaries or pensions, for example, is a form of disposal with or use of public money, which is allowed disposal with budget resources or public funds. This view of the Court is corroborated and is in line with international standards pertaining to this issue. There is no legal definition of the notion disposal with budget funds in the Budgets Law and the laws on execution of budgets that are adopted each year, or in other laws in the financial field. Upon the application of the Regional Association of Winegrowers from Tikvesh area \"Agrotikveshija 2002\" from Kavadarci, through the president Ljupcho Arizanov, with its Resolution U.br.35\/2017 dated 10 May 2017 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions of the laws in item 1 of this decision. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. The reasoning of the Proposed Law states that these amendments to the Electoral Code are continuation of the reform of electoral legislation in order to improve the legislation in line with the comparative analysis of European legislation, and to provide appropriate activities for consistent implementation of election-related legislation. In respect of Article 8-a, the reasoning of the Proposed Law states that the purpose of the amendment of Article 8-a is to fulfill the recommendation to separate the state from the party. The Court also found that under Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. Under paragraph 2 line 1 of the same Article of the Code, in the period of 20 days before the start of the election campaign until the conclusion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: \u2013 be paid subsidies that are not regular monthly payments.

Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to this article: farmers). of the Joint Guidelines indicates that \"the legal framework should provide for a general prohibition of abuse of administrative resources during the election process. The challenged provision of Article 8-a of the Electoral Code is included with the Law on Amendments to the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" no.14\/2014) which was adopted in a shortened procedure. Hence, the ban on the payment of subsidies which is prescribed in the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, according to the Court, is a limitation of the rights of citizens who are beneficiaries of subsidies and who acquire this right on the basis of fulfillment of certain conditions and in a procedure prescribed by law. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. From the title and content of this document it follows that it regulates the misuse of administrative resources during elections, not every form of their use. \u2013 Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. The contested ban on paying subsidies questions the realisation of the legitimate expectations of this category of citizens who have already invested in agricultural production and legitimately expect that some of the invested money and capital will be returned via subsidies. Considering that Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law regulates the same issue as the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, in relation to this Article the Court also finds that it is not in accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. By contrast, abuse of public resources should be sanctioned by law because of the unlawful use of public resources by those in power and state officials for campaign purposes.\" The reasoning of the Proposed Law states that these amendments to the Electoral Code are continuation of the reform of electoral legislation in order to improve the legislation in line with the comparative analysis of European legislation, and to provide appropriate activities for consistent implementation of election-related legislation. From the said content of Article 165-c of the Criminal Code, which sanctions the unlawful disposal of budget funds during elections, it appears that in different paragraphs of this article the legislator has established special forms of committing this crime with a description of the specific actions of commission corresponding to the prohibitions set out in Article 8-a paragraph 1, lines 2 and 3, paragraph 2 lines 1 and 2 and paragraphs 3 and 4 of the same article of the Electoral Code. Hence, the Court finds as a logical conclusion that every disposal with budget funds during elections is not illegal disposal and is not a crime, but only those activities that represent abuse of public money and funds and whose forms are defined in Article 165-c of the Criminal Code. Apart from the Venice Commission and the OSCE, the issue of misuse of administrative resources during elections (more in terms of regional and local elections) is also dealt with by the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Hence, the ban on the payment of subsidies which is prescribed in the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, according to the Court, is a limitation of the rights of citizens who are beneficiaries of subsidies and who acquire this right on the basis of fulfillment of certain conditions and in a procedure prescribed by law. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. Considering that Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law regulates the same issue as the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, in relation to this Article the Court also finds that it is not in accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. Everyone is obliged to observe the Constitution and the laws. There is no legal definition of the notion disposal with budget funds in the Budgets Law and the laws on execution of budgets that are adopted each year, or in other laws in the financial field. The decision to stop the execution of the actions taken based on the provisions of the laws noted in item 1 of this Decision SHALL BE PUT OUT OF EFFECT. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. Subsidies in agriculture are regulated in the Law on Agriculture and Rural Development (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" nos.49\/2010, 53\/2011, 126\/2012, 15\/2013, 106\/2013, 177\/2014, 25\/2015, 73\/2015, 83\/2015, 154\/2015, 11\/2016, 53\/2016, 120\/2016 and 163\/2016). Direct payments are paid to agricultural holdings by agricultural land area, agricultural product unit and livestock, and to purchasers of agricultural products registered in the register of Article 33 of this Law for purchased agricultural products. Article 165-c of the Criminal Code is entitled \"Unlawful disposal with budget funds during elections.\" The period in which the prohibitions of Article 8-a paragraph 1 are valid is the one from the adoption of the decision to call elections to the completion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the electoral results, and from the date of the decision to call elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, except for the prohibitions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which commence 20 days before the start of the electoral campaign. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Constitution, citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are equal in their freedoms and rights regardless of sex, race, colour, national and social origin, political and religious beliefs, property and social status. \u2013 be disposed with budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, funds of the budget of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and funds of public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities disposing with state capital. (3) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code the organizes the holding of a public event marking the start of construction or commissioning of the facility from means from the Budget or public funds or assets from public enterprises or other legal entities managing state capital, in infrastructure such as roads, water supply systems, power lines, sewers, sports playgrounds and other facilities or facilities for social activities, schools, kindergartens and other facilities, shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to one year. of the Joint Guidelines indicates that \"the legal framework should provide for a general prohibition of abuse of administrative resources during the election process. The use of resources should be permitted by law; it implies a legal possibility to use administrative resources during the election process for the proper functioning of the institutions, provided that such use is not for the purposes of the campaign. In terms of the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code, from its content it arises that the legislator has forbidden to pay subsidies that are not regular monthly payments in the period from 20 days before the start of the election campaign to the end the election of President of the Republic of Macedonia, representatives of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia in accordance with the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje. While the former are generally acceptable, even necessary, the measures that mainly concern the campaign should be prevented.\" With the establishment of the ban on payment of subsidies only that are not regular monthly payments, these beneficiaries of state aid are put in an unequal position with other users of state aid, as a result of which the challenged provision is not in accordance either with the constitutional principle of equality of citizens under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. The Court also found that under Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. \u2013 providing stable production of quality and cheaper food and providing the population with sufficient quantities of food, \u2013 increasing the competitiveness of agriculture, \u2013 providing a stable level of income of agricultural holdings, \u2013 sustainable development of rural areas, and \u2013 optimal use of natural resources while respecting the principles of protection of nature and the environment. Paragraph 2 of this Article of the Law stipulates that the aims of paragraph (1) of this Article shall be implemented through measures and policy instruments for: 1) arranging and supporting agricultural markets, 2) direct payments, and 3) rural development Subsidies for which the Law uses the term direct payments, in Article 47 are defined as a measure to support the income of agricultural holdings and purchasers of agricultural products registered in the register of Article 33 of this Law. The legislator established the illegal forms of disposal in other lines of this article of the Electoral Code (Article 8-a paragraph 1 lines 2, 3 and 4) with prohibition of for instance the commencement of construction of infrastructure facilities, extraordinary payments of salaries and pensions, employment of new people in state and public institutions, and so on. As insufficiently precise and clear the challenged provision creates legal uncertainty, as a result of which the Court finds that it is not in compliance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. \u2013 Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos. Citizens before the Constitution and the laws are equal. \u2013 providing stable production of quality and cheaper food and providing the population with sufficient quantities of food, \u2013 increasing the competitiveness of agriculture, \u2013 providing a stable level of income of agricultural holdings, \u2013 sustainable development of rural areas, and \u2013 optimal use of natural resources while respecting the principles of protection of nature and the environment. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Regarding the definition of \"misuse of public resources\" it states that it is widely accepted that it covers the unlawful conduct of public officials, political candidates and parties in power to use their official position or relationship with government institutions in order to influence the outcome of the election. There should be sanctions for misuse of administrative resources and they should be implemented.\" The decision to stop the execution of the actions taken based on the provisions of the laws noted in item 1 of this Decision SHALL BE PUT OUT OF EFFECT. Subsidies in agriculture are regulated in the Law on Agriculture and Rural Development (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\" nos.49\/2010, 53\/2011, 126\/2012, 15\/2013, 106\/2013, 177\/2014, 25\/2015, 73\/2015, 83\/2015, 154\/2015, 11\/2016, 53\/2016, 120\/2016 and 163\/2016). The reasoning of the Proposed Law states that these amendments to the Electoral Code are continuation of the reform of electoral legislation in order to improve the legislation in line with the comparative analysis of European legislation, and to provide appropriate activities for consistent implementation of election-related legislation. From the analysis of the challenged provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 it appears that it prohibits the disposal of budget funds of the Republic of Macedonia, means from the budgets of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, from public funds and funds of public enterprises and public institutions or legal entities disposing with state capital. The proceedings was instigated as there was a reasonable question raised before the Court with regard to the accordance of the challenged articles with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. The proceedings was instigated as there was a reasonable question raised before the Court with regard to the accordance of the challenged articles with the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Constitution, in the Republic of Macedonia laws shall be in accordance with the Constitution and all other regulations in accordance with the Constitution and law. Under paragraph 2 line 1 of the same Article of the Code, in the period of 20 days before the start of the election campaign until the conclusion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the election of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia according to the election results and until the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is, until the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje there may not: Upon the application of the Regional Association of Winegrowers from Tikvesh area \"Agrotikveshija 2002\" from Kavadarci, through the president Ljupcho Arizanov, with its Resolution U.br.35\/2017 dated 10 May 2017 the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia instigated proceedings for appraising the constitutionality of the provisions of the laws in item 1 of this decision. Considering that Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Anti-Corruption Law regulates the same issue as the provision of Article 8-a paragraph 1 line 1 of the Electoral Code, in relation to this Article the Court also finds that it is not in accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law under Article 8 paragraph 1 line 3 of the Constitution. Subsidies for which the Law uses the term direct payments, in Article 47 are defined as a measure to support the income of agricultural holdings and purchasers of agricultural products registered in the register of Article 33 of this Law. From what has been noted it arises that subsidies represent economic budget transfers that primarily aim to encourage the development of certain economic activities through direct payments to the subjects performing those activities (ex. Pursuant to Article 61 of the Law, the payment of direct payments may not be made before it is determined that the user fulfills the conditions for granting direct payments. The period in which the prohibitions of Article 8-a paragraph 1 are valid is the one from the adoption of the decision to call elections to the completion of the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the electoral results, and from the date of the decision to call elections to the completion of the elections for mayor or council members, that is to the constitution of the council of the municipalities and the City of Skopje, except for the prohibitions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which commence 20 days before the start of the electoral campaign. With the same resolution the Court suspended the execution of the actions taken based on the challenged provisions noted in the above laws. Thus, long-term projects or urgent measures must be distinguished from government activities related mainly to the election campaign. Under Article 8 paragraph 1 lines 1, 3 and 5 of the Constitution the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen recognised in international law and defined by the Constitution, the rule of law and political pluralism and free direct and democratic elections are the fundamental values of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. (3) The holder of a public office who contrary to the prohibitions set out in the Electoral Code the organizes the holding of a public event marking the start of construction or commissioning of the facility from means from the Budget or public funds or assets from public enterprises or other legal entities managing state capital, in infrastructure such as roads, water supply systems, power lines, sewers, sports playgrounds and other facilities or facilities for social activities, schools, kindergartens and other facilities, shall be punished with imprisonment of six months to one year.

The reasoning of the Proposed Law states that these amendments to the Electoral Code are continuation of the reform of electoral legislation in order to improve the legislation in line with the comparative analysis of European legislation, and to provide appropriate activities for consistent implementation of election-related legislation. Considering that the protection of legitimate expectations of the subjects of law is an integral element of the principle of the rule of law, it appears that the disputed provision of Article 8-a paragraph 2 line 1 of the Electoral Code is not in accordance with this constitutional principle which is a fundamental value of the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia. Moreover, the Court considers as founded the allegations noted in the initiative that in the challenged provision the prohibition applies to beneficiaries of subsidies only, not mentioning other types of payments for other categories of citizens, such as beneficiaries of scholarships for pupils and students. With the establishment of the ban on payment of subsidies only that are not regular monthly payments, these beneficiaries of state aid are put in an unequal position with other users of state aid, as a result of which the challenged provision is not in accordance either with the constitutional principle of equality of citizens under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia.

The aircraft is equipped with an advanced information-control system and the N035 Irbis radar with effective EPR capable of detecting targets at a distance of up to 400 km. Su-27 is the main military aircraft of the Russian Air Force. Serial Su-27s are painted in standard \u201csky\u201d camouflage for fighters from three shades of blue. Foreign military media rightfully call this machine one of the most serious opponents in the airspace. The aircraft is equipped with a large number of weapons. There are two AL-41F1S engines on this plane, which are structurally distinguished by multi-plane thrust vector control. The aircraft uses improved radar \u201cBeetle\u201d (can be presented in two variations). The PAK FA glider is made according to the normal aerodynamic scheme and has an integral type. One of the best air defense defenses in the world is Russian. The basic configuration involves the installation of medium-range missiles designed to destroy air targets. The practical ceiling is limited to 17,500 m. The maximum speed at the ground is 1400 km \/ h, but when climbing to a great height, the aircraft can accelerate to 2100 km \/ h. It belongs to the 4 ++ generation, although its technical characteristics actually allow us to call it the advanced aircraft of the new generation.",

        "text":"The media offered no analysis that would show why was the organisation of the event so bad, why so few people turned up, why commercial advertisements were integrated in the campaign video, why the sound-system was so bad. Ask Questions of Political Figures and Public Personalities. use the opportunity to present their findings on the current situation in that area in Macedonia; Namely, the media didn't use the opportunity (the very raison d'etre of such events) to remind the citizens (and authorities likewise) about the statistics, cases and activities related to violence against women in Macedonia. That role implies a deeper interest in the concept of human rights, an analysis of activities of the state aimed to facilitate their practicing, reaction to major violations of human rights and promotion of activities (events) aimed to raise the awareness about a given problem (injury) related to human rights. The media play, or should play, a huge role in promotion and protection of human rights. I would place in the same context the media coverage of the latest event related to human rights, which was supposed to animate the public, but above all the state\/government\/politics about the violence against a specific vulnerable group \u2013 the women. The media didn't use the event to approach the politicians and ask them what they did to reduce violence against women, what they intended to do in the future to fight violence against women, whether that issue has been integrated in their election campaign platforms? A true involvement by the media implies a continuing reporting on preparations, analysis related to the idea and the goal of the movement, public calls and actual participation in the event not as observers\/reporters, but as an integral part of the activity. All those are undertaken with the goal to animate as many citizens to raise their voice against violence against women. The media didn't find it necessary to explain the name of the movement and offer explanation about the \"V\" in V-Day. It is customary to use such events to tie them to current social or political affairs and situations in a country. Art has the power to transform thinking and inspire people to act No media got actively involved in the organization of the event, which is prepared for months. No connection was made with the global masculinization of society, manifested not only in the absence of women from key positions of power, but also in the manner how new architectural solutions present the history in such a way to emphasize the role of male sex in history and, in essence, focus on violence throughout history and neglect the other values. The role of the watchdog is given by special media, but certain elements of that function are expected to be integrated in journalism in general and in the operations of each and every media outlet. Rather bombastic headlines like \"Macedonia Joins the Global Campaign to Put an End to Violence against Women\" were used as a smoke-screen for a couple of poor and rashly written paragraphs, leaving the impression that they covered an event that opposes domestic or other form of violence happening in other countries and to other women, not an event that allows the women to raise their voice against the very conditions that create a violent environment and result in specific forms of violence against women in the world and in Macedonia. The country rarely takes part in global human rights-related events and the media are the entities that could contribute greatly to escape that ghetto of insufficient information. The politicians de facto said that they couldn't care less about the violence against women, and the media didn't react to that in any way or fashion. The whole process depends on a developed methodology, creation of relationships, use of video and print promotional materials, efforts to explain its aims and purpose. Lasting social and cultural change is spread by ordinary people doing extraordinary things Not in Macedonia, though. Local women best know what their communities need and can become unstoppable leaders help promote the underlying idea of the event; As if those issues were not part of the obligations of the state. No media was bothered by the absence of political figures from such an action, as if it was totally normal and OK. Organisation of the event. The media never asked why so few people joined the action in the city square and what was going on in the other cities and towns in Macedonia. The analysis is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). help organize the event; Tying it to other events and developments. According to the movements website, the \"V\" stands for Victory, Valentine and Vagina. The fine investigative journalist can and should place the protection of human rights and vulnerable groups in the context of current political affairs and position him or herself as a critic and controller of the government that has accepted the obligation to create the conditions in which all citizens can equally practice their rights and freedoms. It often seems that vulnerable groups and protection of human rights are not as attractive subject matter for the media as the current political affairs, and it seems equally often that they are not really connected with each other directly. Macedonia finds itself in a sort of a ghetto, from the viewpoint of global developments related to promotion and protection of human rights. One must look at the intersection of race, class, and gender to understand violence against women Initiated by the global V-Day movement, on February 14 we had the \"One Billion Rising\" event that marked, all over the world, the preparedness and the will of the people to oppose the widespread violence against women. The event also marked the 15th anniversary of the V-Day movement. By: Prof. Mirjana Najchevska, PHD, human rights expert The media didn't raise the question where were the politicians, public personalities, academics, the plethora of NGOs that allegedly work in the are of gender equality and prevention of discrimination of women? While events like this aim to attract media attention and get the front-page treatment, the media are expected to:",

And when I finally got it on? No sound. Then, no pairing. I bought this a month ago, not so happy I did. Given the nice sound, it is disappointing that they won't play longer. From day one, it seemed like it took forever to charge (approx.4-6 hrs off- never fully charges if you have it on). So, I have to connect it to a phone then it works fine again, then back to the laptop, and it works fine for a while and then goes right back to one speaker and the strange tinny sound. It's super annoying. Bummed with Sony on this one. It's has great sound quality when it has full battery life. It worked fine for a few days, but now every day, it does this strange thing where the sound will only come out of the right speaker and sounds horrible, with no bass and completely tinny. On a full charge, I was lucky to get just over an hour of play time. This speaker was great at first. I have continued to buy portable sony products because you are supposed to be able to link them together with the sony music center. Overall I am quite satisfied with this speaker. Ruined my gathering. Sad Best speaker for the money hands down I was about to take a shower and I like to listen to music in the shower. Then it was just issue after issue, making me more and more angry. I'm gonna buy me another one, but it won't be sony!! In all fairness, the sound on the speaker is very impressive. Really pleased with it easy to setup, and for the price i paid good sound. Horrible made product. No sound. I have continued to buy portable sony products because you are supposed to be able to link them together with the sony music center. Overall I am quite satisfied with this speaker. I am using this speaker in a high-noise environment and have to run it at high volumes to hear it. With the extra bass function on surprising quality for a small speaker. This speaker was great at first. Check the Battery level of the speaker Which I like And you can turn the speaker off .. Overall I am quite satisfied with this speaker. I have had my speaker about a year and when i turn it up all the way, it just shuts off. Sad Best speaker for the money hands down Check the Battery level of the speaker Which I like And you can turn the speaker off .. Would be nice if you could turn the speaker on with the app But hey ho Fantastic speaker my goes everywhere with me Lasts around 14? This can get annoying. The speaker sounds great when it works. The weight of this speaker is not convenient if you are carrying it, in say a beach bag, so it's only handy around the house. I bought a refurbished speaker based upon hearing my friends. It truly is a powerful little speaker. Love this speaker! It worked fine for about a week. Es ist nach jedem Start an. Also, using the flashing lights to the music playing is rather gimicky (thankfully it can be turned off). In all fairness, the sound on the speaker is very impressive. I chalked that up to just bad luck at first but my replacement speaker is now is disconnecting or shutting off in the middle of songs and the volume cuts at 50% for \"low battery\". I'm gonna buy me another one, but it won't be sony!! Da der normale Bass des SRS-XB20 aber sowieso schon mehr als ausreichend ist, habe ich mir bei diesem Ger\u00e4t das Nutzen von Equalizern einfach abgew\u00f6hnt und so funktioniert alles ohne Probleme. great speaker, difficult connection I bought the speaker for myself and I got to say thanks to Sony for creating this speaker. I love the sounds quality and also it's easy to move around the house or where ever you may be. Excellent sound quality (much better than Bose) in a compact and nicely designed speaker. I've had this product a week and for about as much as I was going to spend on a bluetooth speaker I find this to be a good product. It has better sound and can go louder than another bluetooth speaker(different manufacturer) that I borrowed from a friend. Great speaker, but... I've seen this in all of them i've bought, but overall love the speaker. Charging Time LONGER Than Playing Time It has better sound and can go louder than another bluetooth speaker(different manufacturer) that I borrowed from a friend. The speaker will stop music to tell you to charge it. Wouldn't even go room to room without breaking up. Overall really pleased with it. Check the Battery level of the speaker Which I like And you can turn the speaker off .. Would be nice if you could turn the speaker on with the app But hey ho Fantastic speaker my goes everywhere with me Lasts around 14?

The sound is better than our previous speakers used with our IPod and the blue tooth and Spotify works really well too and they pair up easily. SRS-XB20 19.11.2018 o\u0434 Christian1767 I bought this a month ago, not so happy I did. BIS JETZT KEINE PROBLEME!!! Buy it, it is a good speaker with good sound. Bought my Bluetooth speaker today and the sound is awesome!!! Love the design and features of my XB20 Extra Bass . It worked fine for about a week. This small but powerful speaker packs a punch I've had three other Bluetooth speakers Costing from \u00a350-100 but this has to be the best sounding and looking speaker Gone mine in blue Well built love the light flashing to the music Which can be turned off Also you are able to download Sony Music Centre app (I use iPhone 6s) Which allows you to change the settings of the light and switch the light off Change sound control Boost etc... Great little speaker I am very disappointed with the XB20 and only wished I can get a refund. Great little speaker Then it was just issue after issue, making me more and more angry. Well, I bought this speaker a couple of weeks ago to connect to a laptop via bluetooth. Bought and used for a number of months now and superb sound quality. This speaker was great at first. I've had this for a year, You charge it for hours and, it may go two if you are lucky. Pleasantly surprised at the ease of connection. Love the sound: full range including a reasonably hefty bass. It's has great sound quality when it has full battery life. I got it a few years ago. I am using this speaker in a high-noise environment and have to run it at high volumes to hear it. Im extremely disappointed with this product because I paid $100 for it and it doesn't function efficiently. I really do love sony products but this was so disappointing to me Overall really pleased with it. Great unit for the price SRS-XB20 07.01.2019 o\u0434 Jonesey This think was a waste of money I should have gotten a beats pill lol Bought my Bluetooth speaker today and the sound is awesome!!! Buy a speaker that will lasts hours until it dies at full volume and won't tell constantly tell you to charge it. Just get a Bose. Top Sound, klasse Akkulaufzeit DIES TOO FAST!! The bass was great and the size was perfect. BATTERY SUCKS SRS-XB20 12.03.2020 o\u0434 Smhsonyqualitylame I bought this and a month later the battery life would only last for 30 mins then go on low battery mode and hardly play anything after a full charge. Not the best.... Keeping it plugged in does not allow full volume, so charge it use it for as long as it lasts. I generally don't splurge on myself, but loved the sound on the demo so much I bought one for myself last Christmas. The bass was great and the size was perfect. SRS-XB20 28.03.2019 o\u0434 erdnaxelagor En \u00e9coutant le vendeur de la Fnac de Paris-Orly, j'ai cru qu'il exag\u00e9rait la qualit\u00e9 du produit et j'en suis ultra satisfait! I will NOT be getting another sony speaker because of the SRS XB20. I generally don't splurge on myself, but loved the sound on the demo so much I bought one for myself last Christmas. Buy it, it is a good speaker with good sound. Would recommend to all. Could have liked this...... Great speaker, but... I have had this speaker for several months now and it works great. The sound cuts in half when the battery is dying. Als das Produkt funktionierte war ich sehr zufrieden. Size is quite small, allowing it to be placed in a bucket or box to direct the sound. Love this speaker! The speaker also has an annoying feature of playing very quietly with a low battery but it seems like half battery is when it starts. Battery life is okay, lasts about 3 hours at max volume listening to heavy metal; this is acceptable IMO considering that this requires a lot of energy and the unit becomes warm to the touch when listening at high volumes for prolonged times, proving just how much power it's using. The Bass booster 'extra bass' is great if you don't want to hear anything else but bass tones. It's dead easy to use and Bluetooth to the phone is simple. I have about 11 different Bluetooth speakers fugoo, Anker Altec Lansing, Bose, and many more brands. BIS JETZT KEINE PROBLEME!!! I bought this and a month later the battery life would only last for 30 mins then go on low battery mode and hardly play anything after a full charge. Jedoch darf man wegen der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe keine \"Wahnsinns-B\u00e4sse\" erwarten, f\u00fcr den Innengebrauch aber voll zu empfehlen.",

The week aims to increase awareness of global antibiotic resistance and to encourage best practices among the general public, health care workers and policy-makers to avoid its further emergence and spread. This year, WAAW focuses in particular on health workers and the vital role they play in defending the power of antibiotics. This year, the world will mark the second annual World Antibiotic Awareness Week (WAAW), with the overarching theme \"Handle with Care\", from 14 to 20 November.

The WHO Report on the Burden of Endemic Health Care-Associated Infection Worldwide states that, in Europe, these infections cause 16 million extra days spent in hospital as well as 37 000 attributable deaths, and that they contribute to an additional 110 000 deaths every year. Now is the time for health care workers, policy-makers and the general public, alike, to take action and \"handle antibiotics with care\" to halt the spread of antibiotic resistance and promote the responsible use of these life-saving medicines. Steps can be taken at all levels of society to reduce the impact and limit the spread of resistance. Antibiotic resistance is accelerated by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, as well as poor infection prevention and control. This year, the world will mark the second annual World Antibiotic Awareness Week (WAAW), with the overarching theme \"Handle with Care\", from 14 to 20 November. It can also help to educate patients about how to prevent infections, for example through vaccination, hand washing, safer sex, and covering the nose and mouth when sneezing.

        "text":"7 And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation, wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more. 12 Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 5 Now he that maketh us for this very thing, is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit. 17 For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak. 10 For we must all be manifested before the judgement seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil. 8 For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed. 20 For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. 15 And his bowels are more abundantly towards you; remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you have received him. For we are come as far as to you in the gospel of Christ. 6 Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings. 7 Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 10 And herein I give my advice; for this is profitable for you, who have begun not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago. 24 Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the evidence of your charity, and of our boasting on your behalf. This also we pray for, your perfection. 1 Therefore, seeing we have this ministration, according as we have obtained mercy, we faint not; 2 But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience, in the sight of God. 16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? 2 For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God. 17 Now the Lord is a Spirit. 13 For I mean not that others should be eased, and you burthened, but by an equality. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also. 11 For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you; yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge: in all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter. 14 For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead. 9 But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles, 10 (For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible,) 11 Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles, when absent, such also we will be indeed when present. 4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels, 5 And every height that exhalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ; 6 And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled. 7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency may be of the power of God, and not of us. 8 In all things we suffer tribulation, but are not distressed; we are straitened, but are not destitute; 9 We suffer persecution, but are not forsaken; we are cast down, but we perish not: 10 Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies. 13 For what is there that you have had less than the other churches, but that I myself was not burthensome to you? 3 And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth): 4 That he was caught up into paradise, and heard secret words, which it is not granted to man to utter. 5 For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord; and ourselves your servants through Jesus. 16 I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you. 14 And no wonder: for Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light. God knoweth it. 15 For all things are for your sakes; that the grace abounding through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God. 10 For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death. 1 Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand. 14 And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth. 13 But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you. 4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God. Did Titus overreach you? 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? 14 Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? 14 Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh; but now we know him so no longer. 12 You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you are straitened. 10 For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. 6 But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus. 1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia: 2 Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 16 Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. 7 (For we walk by faith, and not by sight.) 7 That as in all things you abound in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all carefulness; moreover also in your charity towards us, so in this grace also you may abound. 23 But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: 24 Not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in faith you stand. Chapter 2 We speak before God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification. Chapter 6 1 And we helping do exhort you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain. 13 For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. 4 And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God. For we have said before, that you are in our hearts, to die together, and to live together. 14 In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want, that there may be an equality, 15 As it is written: He that had much, had nothing over; and he that had little, had no want. 4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you. 4 Great is my confidence for you, great is my glorying for you. 19 And not that only, but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord, and our determined will: 20 Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us. 32 At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend me. 33 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and so escaped his hands. 13 For such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 18 But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ; and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. For you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 3 Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked. 4 For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life. For the letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth. Did we not walk with the same spirit? 3 Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you? 10 And he that ministereth seed to the sower, will both give you bread to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice: 11 That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God. 20 For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. 11 You helping withal in prayer for us: that for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf. 7 That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation. 6 To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many: 7 So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. 15 And Christ died for all; that they also who live, may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again. 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is, was in him. 12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off the occasion from them that desire occasion, that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 7 Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as reprobates. 1 Would to God you could bear with some little of my folly: but do bear with me. 17 Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? 2 You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men: 3 Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart. 14 Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 11 For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake; that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates? 13 All the saints salute you. 11 Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men; but to God we are manifest. 3 And I wrote this same to you; that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow, from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. 17 If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away, behold all things are made new. 8 And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work, 9 As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever. 10 Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us. If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ's, let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ's, so are we also. Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you? I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation. 8 For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent; and if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful; 9 Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful; but because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing. 10 The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia. 11 Wherefore? 13 But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believed, for which cause I have spoken; we also believe, for which cause we speak also: 14 Knowing that he who raised up Jesus, will raise us up also with Jesus, and place us with you. 15 And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace: 16 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea. 2 I have told before, and foretell, as present, and now absent, to them that sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare. 3 And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost, 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine unto them. 3 But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted, and fall from the simplicity that is in Christ. For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God. 17 Wherefore, Go out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing: 18 And I will receive you; and I will be a Father to you; and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 12 We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf; that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart. 22 They are Hebrews: so am I. They are Israelites: so am I. They are the seed of Abraham: so am I. 23 They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise): I am more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above measure, in deaths often. 15 But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls; although loving you more, I be loved less. 21 For we forecast what may be good not only before God, but also before men. 6 For although I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but in all things we have been made manifest to you. 7 Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself, that you might be exalted? 18 But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. Chapter 4 12 Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence: 13 And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void. Chapter 5 1 For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven. 6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ Jesus. 30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmity. 16 But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. 18 But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not. 15 For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish. 16 To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient? For I ought to have been commended by you: for I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing. 11 Now therefore perform ye it also in deed; that as your mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have. 12 For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath, not according to that which he hath not. 11 I am become foolish: you have compelled me. 8 For we would not have you ignorant,brethren, of our tribulation, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life. Chapter 7 1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sactification in the fear of God. 5 For also when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we suffered all tribulation; combats without, fears within. 18 I desired Titus, and I sent with him a brother. 7 Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is made void: 8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory? 20 For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man strike you on the face. 5 Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before, and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness. 9 But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead. 9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he became poor, for your sakes; that through his poverty you might be rich. 19 For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins; and he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation. 9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory. 12 For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you. 5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound. 6 Therefore having always confidence, knowing that, while we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord. 22 And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things; but now much more diligent, with much confidence in you, 23 Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ. 3 Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed: 4 But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses, 5 In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, 6 In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned, 7 In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left; 8 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known; 9 As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed; 10 As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things. 1 If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed): but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 5 Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God. 24 Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes, save one. 25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea. 26 In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from false brethren. did we not in the same steps? 6 Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer. 2 For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire? 13 For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for you. And I hope that you shall know unto the end: 14 As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 8 I speak not as commanding; but by the carefulness of others, approving also the good disposition of your charity. 13 But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged. 4 For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. 11 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory. 1 Now I Paul myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ, who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent, am bold toward you. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void). 16 And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus. 17 Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you? 11 Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is enlarged. 5 For such an one I will glory; but for myself I will glory nothing, but in my infirmities. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 8 For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth. 15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works. 9 For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. 21 Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us, that we might be made the justice of God in him. 8 Wherefore, I beseech you, that you would confirm your charity towards him. 9 For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things. 10 And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. 16 But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile. 16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. 3 For according to their power (I bear them witness), and beyond their power, they were willing. 2 For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians. That Achaia also is ready from the year past, and your emulation hath provoked very many. 3 Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you, be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready: 4 Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter. 11 For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace; and the God of peace and of love shall be with you. And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest. But in our consolation, we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. 2 I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven. 4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom we have not preached; or if you receive another Spirit, whom you have not received; or another gospel which you have not received; you might well bear with him. 31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not. 6 Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter, but in the spirit. 17 That which I speak, I speak not according to God, but as it were in foolishness, in this matter of glorying. 12 And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord, 13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia. 18 For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he, whom God commendeth. Chapter 11 16 I say again, (let no man think me to be foolish, otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a little.) 14 And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you. 12 Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord, 13 By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them, and unto all. 8 I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your ministry. 9 And, when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia; and in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you, and so I will keep myself.",

In the light of rising tensions between Georgia and its two regions over the past week, Russia decided on Tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces. NATO announced at a summit early this month that Georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance, in the face of fierce Russian opposition. In a statement on April 21, UNOMIG said that its monitors \"did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side.\" NATO and Georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors, in the so-called North Atlantic Council, will travel to Georgia in \"coming months\" in a show of support for the would-be candidate. In a televised address to the people of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Saakashvili said: \"Georgia wants peace.\" Russia has peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia under an agreement with Georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with Moscow. In a televised address to the people of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Saakashvili said: \"Georgia wants peace.\" The remarks came after Russia's defense ministry announced Tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia and South Ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-Western Georgia. Finland, current chair of the 56-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OCSE] expressed concern Wednesday over \"increased tension\" in Georgia. The remarks came after Russia's defense ministry announced Tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia and South Ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-Western Georgia. Any attempt by the Georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against Russian peacekeepers and also against Russian citizens... will be met with an adequate and tough answer, news agencies quoted the ministry as saying. No plans revealed for Georgia action Georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over Moscow's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in Georgia. Finland, current chair of the 56-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OCSE] expressed concern Wednesday over \"increased tension\" in Georgia. NATO announced at a summit early this month that Georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance, in the face of fierce Russian opposition. Georgia attempts to defuse situation President Saakashvili called for an end to the conflict Georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with Russia from further escalating with President Mikhail Saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict. Russia objects to NATO moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by Tbilisi's rapprochement with Moscow's old Cold War-era foe. Georgia claims that Russia has, over the last three months, strengthened its control over Abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities. The Georgian Foreign Ministry called the plan an \"act of irresponsible provocation,\" Russian news agency Interfax reported. The OSCE was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders, the statement said. The EU leaders called for calm, with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana saying that the bloc would like to \"de-escalate the tension.\" Most inhabitants of the two regions hold Russian passports. In a televised address to the people of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Saakashvili said: \"Georgia wants peace.\" Around 2,000 Russians serve there and a further 1,000 in South Ossetia. Abkhazia and South Ossetia are both Russian-dominated regions of Georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject Tbilisi's rule. NATO announced at a summit early this month that Georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance, in the face of fierce Russian opposition. Earlier Wednesday, Georgia attacked Russia's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway Georgian regions as the start of \"full scale military aggression.\" EU criticize Russian deployment Solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment Finland, current chair of the 56-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OCSE] expressed concern Wednesday over \"increased tension\" in Georgia. The allies are unanimous in supporting, endorsing Georgia's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty, he said. If Georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force, we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Stubb said the April 20 downing of Georgian drone over Abkhazia \"and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region.\" But he said: \"Have no doubt; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground.\" Bakradze said that a UN mission monitoring Georgia and Abhkazia, UNOMIG, \"verifies everything\" in terms of his country's military deployments. Around 2,000 Russians serve there and a further 1,000 in South Ossetia.

        "text":"Therefore, gender mainstreaming agricultural and rural development policies contributes to the empowerment of women, making them active agents in the promotion of agricultural productivity and the socio-economic progress of the entire society. Only 9.65 percent of women have a leading role in decision making activities related to land, while 50 percent of women landowners are not active in the decision-making process related to the land or agricultural production. For the first time in North Macedonia, registered women agricultural producers will have an opportunity to benefit from financial support which aims to strengthen their agro-businesses and reduce persisting inequalities among women and men in the sector. The new measure is a result of the collaborative effort of UN Women and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE) to develop gender-responsive policies and budgets in the agricultural sector and empower women farmers and their agro-businesses. Agriculture is seen as a men-dominated sector, yet as a driver of growth and development, this sector should provide greater recognition to women and their important role in agriculture,\" said Andrijana Velevska, State Advisor for Rural Development, during the launch press conference. The new measure is a result of the collaborative effort of UN Women and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE) to develop gender-responsive policies and budgets in the agricultural sector and empower women farmers and their agro-businesses. Gender inequality is an important topic for every society, and it is particularly evident in the agricultural sector and rural areas.\t\u0418\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0430\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0440\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0458\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0440\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0458, \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442, \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0458\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, \u0440\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0458, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0447\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u0417\u0430\u0435\u0432, \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0458\u045c\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0458\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0445, \u0430 \u043f\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0442 \u041a\u041e\u0412\u0418\u0414-19 \u0443\u0448\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u045c\u0435 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430, \u043a\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e. The initiative is part of the UN Women project \"Promoting Gender Responsive Policies and Budgets: Towards Transparent, Inclusive and Accountable Governance in the Republic of North Macedonia\", financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Swedish International Development Agency - Sida. The working group, representing all relevant institutions in advancing rural and agricultural development, academia and civil society, managed to position itself as a trusted advisor and advocated for policy changes and increased allocations for women in rural areas. A recent study supported by UN Women and led by the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Food in North Macedonia revealed crucial findings of the position of women in rural areas by measuring the level of empowerment of women in agriculture. According to the State Statistical Office of North Macedonia, 39 percent of the country's workers in agriculture are women. The piloting phase of the measure aims to reach 100 registered women agricultural producers, with the prospect for expanding in 2020. Rural women often face barriers for achieving their full potential, given restrictive traditional practices, policies and segmented labour markets.

Date: Tuesday, November 26, 2019 In November 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy of North Macedonia launched a new measure that provides an opportunity for women farmers to benefit from financial support and improve their economic situation. A recent study supported by UN Women and led by the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Food in North Macedonia revealed crucial findings of the position of women in rural areas by measuring the level of empowerment of women in agriculture. With UN Women support under the Memorandum of Understanding with the MAFWE, the working group supported the development of the first measure for support of women under the National Program for Agriculture and Rural Development (2018-2022), and setting of needs responsive criteria and provisions to enable rural women to truly benefit from the programme. The new measure is a result of the collaborative effort of UN Women and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE) to develop gender-responsive policies and budgets in the agricultural sector and empower women farmers and their agro-businesses. The working group, representing all relevant institutions in advancing rural and agricultural development, academia and civil society, managed to position itself as a trusted advisor and advocated for policy changes and increased allocations for women in rural areas. In November 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy of North Macedonia launched a new measure that provides an opportunity for women farmers to benefit from financial support and improve their economic situation. Only 9.65 percent of women have a leading role in decision making activities related to land, while 50 percent of women landowners are not active in the decision-making process related to the land or agricultural production. This example of gender-responsive policymaking for supporting women in agriculture proves how gender responsive budgeting works in practice and how public funds could be used to meaningfully improve the quality of life of the most excluded groups in society.",

        "text":"It is necessary to examine the steps all the time. It is important to keep the capital that is invested. Both sides of the coin have equal chances for success. It is part of the learning process. If the trend of curve of the currency pair is favorable, it is necessary to leave the curve to work for the dealer and prolong the taking up of the profit as much as possible. At the beginning of the analysis, it is necessary to check the basic trend and the time frame according to which the dealer is trading. It is the only winning way. It is necessary to practice daily trading, to write notes and research new strategies. The problem is that these same dealers succumb to prejudices of exaggerated self-confidence. However, it is a completely different when the trading is in real version. More information provide clearer picture on the market. When the dealers are faced with real financial decisions, they succumb very easily to emotions. Dealers may feel self confidence in their abilities and remain calm while dealing on demo account. Most important of all is the self control. After setting all the above said, it is important for the dealer to allocate a bit of his\/her time in reading the reports by the best analytics and comments by commercial banks. Then the points of \"support\" and \"resistance\" should be anticipated, how firm these points are and create as many as possible technical formations of the chart. But the goal is to realize as much as possible higher number of flipping coins with expected outcome or one flipping coin to be with \"higher\" expected value than the losses. It is not unusual for the dealers to realize a winning serial and believe that they shall never make a mistake in future. Golden rule in foreign currency trading is not to accept excessive risk, because excessive risk brings along with it a possibility for high loss, i.e. the dealer has to calculate what loss he\/she may suffer. People are by nature directed inwardly. After the dealer gathers this information, he\/she may create a strategy and plan for dealing during the day. Allow yourself to make a mistake and admit the mistake instead of looking for other culprits. The ego of the people is looking for confirmation so to be evidenced that they know what are they doing and that they are better than the others. The challenge is to find the right combination of tools, which shall provide the dealer with realization of profit. If someone is a beginner in trading, it would be best to start with trading on demo version, and when he\/she begins to trade in real application, to be under supervision of a more experienced dealer at least in the beginning. Before beginning of a trading currency day, the dealer has to take a look at the charts and see what was happening at the market while he\/she was absent. Most of the people begin to know the foreign market with technical analysis of the charts, with historic trends of currency pairs. It is important to develop a scenario for reaching unexpected decisions because the market is unpredictable. Technical analysis is made on how the currency pairs behaved in the past. Especially because of the fact that the foreign market operates 24 hours per day, almost every day in the year, and it is impossible for the dealer to be permanently active. Trading is like flipping coins. This reaction is the reason for failure of a number of dealers. There after there is fundamental analysis, why some currency pairs behaved as they had in the past and how would they behave in the future. After making the technical analysis, it is necessary to establish long-term trend and calculate the probability for its occurrence. The fact must be accepted that the errors are inevitable, especially in the early phases.",

The event is part of the project ''A view from the Outside\"- Whether and how is the court protection for victims of domestic violence regarding the temporary measures of protection provided?, which is part of the USAID civil society project, implemented by Foundation open society Macedonia. Special emphasis was given to the following findings: Roma access to health services, barriers to access, behavioral of the health professionals to Roma patients, the quality of health services for Roma patients and the discrimination in health care. On the event, there was a presentation of the main findings of the previously conducted analysis on the civil court proceedings for issuing the temporary measures of protection in ten basic courts: Veles, Bitola, Kumanovo, Tetovo, Stip, Radovis, Gostivar, Delcevo, Debar and Strumica. The aim was to inform the representatives of the paralegal programs about the human rights of drug users and sexual workers, as well as with the mechanisms and services for their protection. The training was attended by representatives from several civil organizations from RM that work in the field of promotion of citizen's health and alleviating the access of different groups of citizens to basic health services in the public health sector.

It is safe in case of fire because it emits a small amount of carbon dioxide. This process changes the cellular structure of the tree, and the result is an increase in dimensional stability, durability, resistance to moisture pests, bacteria, viruses and thermal insulation properties. News on the market in Macedonia! At the same time, Thermo wood is an environmentally friendly, natural product, the use of which has an even greater range of possibilities than wood itself. Its color is from light to dark brown, with a pleasant appearance and depends on the temperature at which it is processed and the purpose. Floors of ships, parquets and decks that you can install in your homes or businesses today are made of thermally-treated wood. The wood has improved characteristics up to 70 percent of ordinary wood and is not subject to deformation and has the properties of tropical trees with high resistance to moisture, water and rot. This achieves protection of the tree from the influence of water, moisture, rot and bacteria, and thus achieves tree longevity, stability. of the material and easy processing. Termowood is an alternative to teak and other tropical trees but at a lower price. We are the Expert in this Field, Better Solutions Since 1999 The whole process is natural and is performed in an environment with saturated water vapor, without the presence of oxygen and at a high temperature of 170 to 212 degrees Celsius. No chemicals are used during the processing. This is especially evident in the application in a more humid environment, such as facades, terraces and gardens of homes and restaurants, areas around the pool, beach or sauna, bath. Thermal processing is a completely new natural technological approach to creating a new type of wood with altered chemical mechanical properties of the material.",

For people familiar with the ecclesiastical affairs, however, it was clear as early as the 1990s that Russian priests in Western Europe were refusing to celebrate Divine Liturgy together with priests of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and in the Russian clerical media quite often there were materials targeting the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Considering the withdrawal of the ROC from the deal before the previous council, it is doubtful now that anyone will take his word seriously. He was excommunicated by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church in the early 1990s, but last year his letter to the same Synod was extremely favorably accepted by the Synod. The Russian thesis in this has always been that the Ecumenical Patriarch is not a champion of the Orthodox world and that the ROC should become the leading Orthodox Church.",

        "text":"People look out of their apartment windows to show gratitude to health-care workers during the coronavirus outbreak in Madrid, Spain. Around the globe, governments have implored residents to stay home to protect themselves and others from the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19. As a consequence, gender differences in leadership effectiveness (what it takes to perform well) are out of sync with gender differences in leadership emergence (what it takes to make it to the top). April 01, 2020 - Although there is a great deal of public interest in ensuring more women become leaders, thereby reversing their under-representation in the ranks of power, too many suggested solutions are founded on the misconception that women ought to emulate men. As we have argued before, the real problem is not a lack of competent females; it is too few obstacles for incompetent males, which explains the surplus of overconfident, narcissistic, and unethical people in charge. Governments worldwide have imposed lockdowns to contain the coronavirus, but those same restrictions have increased the risks associated with domestic violence, especially for women, children, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Indeed, research shows that the prevalence of male senior leaders is not a product of superior leadership talent in men. The thinking is: \"If men have most of the top roles, they must be doing something right, so why not get women to act like them?\" But this logic fails to account for the relatively dismal performance of most leaders \u2013 who are overwhelmingly male. But for domestic violence victims\u2013the vast majority of whom are women, children, and LGBTQ+ individuals\u2013home is a dangerous place. Rather, large quantitative studies, including meta-analyses, indicate that gender differences in leadership talent are either nonexistent, or they actually favor women.",

        "text":"Controlling people's trust in media, too. It was reprinted not only in Bulgaria, but in the UK as well (here and here). In other words \u2013 it's for internal use only. In addition, Macedonians themselves obviously got used to foreign media crews filming on the streets of Skopje. And second \u2013 fake news, directed against local Bulgarian independent media and journalists, politicians from the opposition, non compliant businessman, intellectuals, and all those, who dare to criticize the political status quo in the country. The animal was injured and recovered shortly after, fortunately. There are several joint initiatives of the EU, as well as several European platforms, which try to reach the local news consumer, but I would say their footprint is minimal to none. Later on we came to know that the tourist was not Bulgarian, but Albanian, and the swan was not killed. It was, and still is to certain extend, hard to find a positive story from Bulgaria (or related to Bulgaria) in the Macedonian media outlets. In 2017 it was 946 billion US dollar (source: Michael Kofman, CNA 2017). Are the media associations active in countering disinformation? I think they have more of declarative than proactive nature. For those of us, who knew more about Mr Nedelkovski, his professional reputation and his history of acts toward political opponents, journalists and independent intellectuals in Macedonia, it was obvious that it would be wrong to put a sign of equality between him and Macedonian journalism. In addition, I honestly think there is no sufficient political will to address this problem, since, in the first place, politicians in power and their affiliated businesses benefit to a great extent by all negative campaigns against the independent voices in the country. Its pinnacle was reached by the time it became obvious we are going to witness significant political changes in Macedonia some 3 years ago. Every other day there are news reports, dedicated to Macedonia. Were there any final convictions for inciting hatred and causing damage through spreading fake news \u2013 disinformation, or hatred speech? Local Macedonian authorities also opened themselves toward foreign media recently much more, compared to the time of Mr Nikola Gruevski governing as prime minister, for example. That is why headlines, which generally sound like: \"Norwegian paedophiles want Bulgarian children\" or \"Europe is banning Orthodox Christianity\" are even possible We probably need to first differentiate the main types of fake news, thrown into the public space in Bulgaria. Does Bulgaria has any action plan on countering disinformation and manipulation and have you seen any progress or impact from it? However, in my opinion, the quality of the news reports from Macedonia has improved in the last 10 years and became more comprehensive and in-depth. As a reporter for the news programs at the biggest and most viewed Bulgarian media I've been covering Macedonia for the past 10 years and I think the ongoing political and social processes in Macedonia are very interesting to the Bulgarian public. And do you have any idea about the defense budget for the same period of time of the Russian Federation? The historical bond determines apparent emotional ties. Well, it's $47.4 billion. First of all, the journalists, who cover topics in Macedonia, have now much better background and thus understanding of the political and social processes in the country. Bulgaria is a border state between the West and the East. Closer look at the problem will clearly outline two main narratives \u2013 one directed towards the West (against the EU, NATO, the USA, and the western values in general). Bulgarians are just truly curious about Macedonia and Macedonians. That is why it is seen as a weak spot on the European map by the Russian propaganda. The prosecutor's office then refused to investigate the case and to press charges against him. Which are the most prominent manipulations and disinformation spread through the media in Bulgaria\/the media in Bulgarian? Bulgaria has deep historical and cultural ties with Russia. Furthermore, I know there is a new generation of investigative journalists coming up in Macedonia, who's work and efforts in the field should be respected. I would not say often. If you cannot win a conventional confrontation \u2013 with guns, planes, tanks etc, it is only natural to transfer the action to the field of the so called \"hybrid war\", as we call it \u2013 fake news and control over the information flows are the most effective weapons in this combat. Without conducting any scientific content analysis of fake news in Bulgaria, as working journalist and consumer of local news, I would say that the first type of misinformation is more dominant around here. 10 years ago it was still an exotic view. And local media realized that fact. This also adds to Bulgarian journalists working much easier on Macedonian soil. Is disinformation about Macedonia present often in the media? That is why it is seen as a weak spot on the European map by the Russian propaganda. And there is a clear reason why \u2013 when talking to young journalists or journalism students I often refer to one single question: Do you know what the accumulated defense budget of NATO alliance is? Fact-checking Ivan Georgiev: The fight against disinformation in Bulgaria is almost nonexistent Keep in mind Bulgaria is a member state. Certain Bulgarian media outlets produced comprehensive coverage of the so called \"journalist\" Milenko Nedelkovski and some of his acts, regarding a monument in Macedonia, which is part of the Bulgarian heritage there, without taking into account (or simply neglecting) his affiliation to the previous Macedonian government and its \"strongmen\". This predominantly negative image of the neighbors was part of the Macedonian political doctrine for many years. Even if there is actual, specific plan to fight fake news and disinformation in Bulgaria, I haven't heard of it. How much is North Macedonia present in the media reports in Bulgaria? It may be curious for your readers to learn that back in May 2018 the Member of Parliament with the biggest opposition party at the moment Mr Tasko Ermenkov came into public focus after spreading the rumor the water in our nation's capital (Sofia) is poisoned and people should not drink it via his Facebook profile. The first and most blatant one was actually first published by Macedonian media outlets and later on reprinted by Bulgarian media, which didn't make the effort to check the facts \u2013 it was in the spring of 2016, when local Macedonian media published information about Bulgarian female tourist, who supposedly killed a swan on the Ohrid lake by grabbing one of its wings in order to make a selfie photo. That is why headlines, which generally sound like: \"Norwegian paedophiles want Bulgarian children\" or \"Europe is banning Orthodox Christianity\", are possible. He has covered some of the leading international and regional events in the past few years, Macedonia included to a large extent. Ivan is author of numerous short documentaries. For those of us, who conduct meticulous content analysis of the Macedonian media, it was just an example of the long lasting trend of negative coverage of Bulgaria in Macedonia. Ivan Georgiev: The fight against disinformation in Bulgaria is almost nonexistent That is the reason for Macedonia to be present quite often in the news flow in Bulgaria \u2013 with video and on-the-ground live reporting, as well as in-depth TV documentaries, written articles online, in the newspapers and all other form of contemporary media. As matter of fact, I can remember only a few fake news related to Macedonia, which found place in Bulgarian media recently. Meta.mk spoke with him about disinformation and the media manipulations in Bulgaria and in the region, with a spotlight to how much Macedonia is actually a target of such malicious content. There were a few cases of investigation and even one or two preliminary charges, but no final convictions.",

During the calendar 2005 HFH Macedonia and Moznosti, a local implementing partner of the global microfinance coalition Opportunity International, initiated partnership through innovative program in Macedonia. Starting FY2006 the partners set up a credit line that provides small loans ($ 2,400-5000) for reconstruction and renovation of substandard homes. It is first partnership of that kind in Europe and Central Asia region. They resulted in 60 reconstructions completed, while 38 were being in progress. It is projected 5 years after its commencement, the Fund to have $ 1.5 mil. of which $ 500,000 HFH Macedonia's capital and $ 1 mil. Generally, the goal of this approach is to address the poverty housing in Macedonia on a scale larger than the traditional Habitat program, in terms of the number of partner families served. The business model has several other, distinctive components: faster turnover of the funds; guaranteed repayment; and moderate interest rate imposition, projected to be higher than the inflation rate adjustment.

        "text":"Beside the great popularity of FPS games, such as Counterstrike, Overwatch and most recently Valorant, there was a game that was presented on the IGN Expo, named Splitgate Arena Warfare, that incorporates the mechanics of the comic game Portal with basic FPS elements. From the games with spaceships the newest game is Haunted Space, an impressively made game with space vehicles where the flying of the ship reminds more of Star Conflict (a free to play game on Steam that uses the aiming mechanics of one of the most popular games with airplanes on Steam called War Thunder) than ELITE Dangerous where the controls of aiming and flying are harder to master. An interesting mechanic, but it wasn't mentioned if the characters themselves have other abilities except the ability to open portals. Namely the players can open portals through walls and obstacles and pass through them or shoot through the holes. But still, Haunted Space is a game for grownups because of the horror elements that are seemingly grotesque while the graphics are impressive. The second game that was presented is Streets of Rage 4, a new game that reminds too much of the ultra popular arcade era game Final Fight. Naturally with enhanced graphics and more characters. Maybe the most interesting educational game that was presented is the game Unpacking, where you unpack items from cardboard boxes and put them in place in several rooms of an apartment from which kids can learn the good habit of tidying up their room. Again in this game, there are also skins for weapons that change the appearance of the current weapons to look more prestigious. Through a live stream, the IGN Summer of gaming 2021 has started on 11th of June via the IGN Expo stream, where world premieres of new games have been presented, different games from those already advertised on such events. There is even a same character as Cody from Final Fight, but it is drawn worse than the original character. While the whole game creates a feeling of nostalgia for the times of arcade games, such games can be played now through the program mame32. In Haunted Space, you can combine different parts on the vehicles that reminds of the game for kids from Steam named Robocraft, where the players make robots from different parts that fight each other.",

        "text":"You know the guy I told you I would not vote for. It was confirmed on the elections that he should not exist. Mind you, he had been removed from the customs, and now extorts money from companies. MJ: Marijan? SG: Thank you. Bye now. MJ: Let me speak to Zoki. NT: Call him and tell him we will fuck his brains out. GT: From 24 that were on the list you gave us, we imposed 8 severe fines in amount of 4,800 EUR and closed 2 establishments, you know, wholesale buyers, for not calculating personal income tax and shops. Because that has happened before Mile arrived in Strumica, extortion and racketeering of companies in Strumica. Next day, wholesale centres are closed and one day later he lowered cabbage price to 4 MKD. Market [inspections] went in there today. MJ: I'm getting in my car, speak... We are losing by a difference of only 500 votes. I'm waiting for the results from three polling stations. MJ: No, no. MJ: No, send them to the other location, talk to Slave. That should be enough. Conversation between Mile Janakieski and Slave Gosev MJ: How are you? JV: But, one of the judges is causing me problems, because the ruling that I have adopted, does not have your signature...you know the documents from the case file... MJ: Who had signed it? Conversation between Gordana Jankuloska and Slave Gosev GJ: Hello Slave, what did you do? MJ: Spiro, they have lowered... SG: Listen, I'm not Silvana Boneva. MJ: Good. Bye. JV: In order to have it finished, I'll finish the job as needed... They asked this amount in EUR, but if the business owners didn't give them, they would mock them by saying: you're stingy for 50,000 MKD. NG: You should know what we are doing now. VP: All right, consider it done. GJ: Because we don't have control there. SG: Minister? SM: Because we delayed things a little. GT: But give me a sign, not to keep my people there by tomorrow morning. First they said 50,000 and didn't indicate any currency, so the people started complaining. MJ: Everything is under control. That's what you should tell him. MJ: Screaming, yelling. What can I say? SR: I understand you brother. But, I'm telling you. It's better this way. GT: Why are they bickering? I: I guess you know him, he's responsible for here. GJ: Speak Slave. NT: With a scare gun... MT: Speak? SG: Well, two are in Roma, two are in the town where we can have influence, where we stand well among [the constituency]. NG: I don't have such information from there, to be honest. JV: That's nice... MT: I'm here, with some people. JV: That's nice... Look, I'm calling about an urgent matter, about you know.... you follow me, right? We're in talks with DPA to gain their support and we'll screw over Zaev. BI: we're discussing that item. SB: And he is already co-owner of \"Vega\"... SM: Can you vote for us now, about Strumica, to have our complaint approved? MJ: There will be screaming and yelling. SG: Definitely, according to the minutes... DPL: Did you hear him? NG: Yes, ye. DPL: Exactly that. By Slave Gosev. NG: Weren't they asking for sponsorship? SG: OK. JV: How are you Mister Minister? JV: Nobody. GJ: Bye. BI:.... in two minutes... But those you are mentioning, the four shops in the gypsy neighbourhood, i.e. Turkish neighbourhood, that list was not given to my people. However, the racket did not happen in the beginning of the campaign, but somewhere in the middle, but of unprecedented scope. SR: What's under control? MT: I'm calling them now and will let you know in a minute. SR: Mother fucking spies. I: Listen, I am from Skopje. We know each other Minister. VP: It's good here, but [the support] is melting... That's the idea and now they have been pressured... This would be the second time, and if we find irregularities, we will have to close his pizzeria. Same team from Skopje is there, should they visit him again? GJ: Nino... GJ: Are the polling stations open? And tell him that if he cooperates with us until 5th June, we will be more understandable, because we will win the elections again and will have that in mind. That negatively reflects on... Bye now. SR: Bye. You tell him to work with Zaev again. MJ: To be made. MJ: When is Ljube's rally taking place? SG: Let me spread the words... VP: Yes please? GJ: Hello, Vase! Conversation between Mile Janakieski and Goran Trajkovski I: Should I give him your number? Hahaha. VP: All right. SB: You need to be careful about the racket and about what you are telling me, everything has been replicated in Strumica. GJ:...to hell with them. MJ: You go in and conduct the inspection. You have them or should I find them? Conversation between Mile Janakieski and Marijan Nakovski (Commander of the Sector on Internal Affairs in Strumica) Conversation between Mile Janakieski and Marijan Nakovski (Commander of the Sector on Internal Affairs in Strumica) MJ: Marijan, please call this person, Saso Ninov. I: Gjoko, Gjoko speaking here. Director Goran gave me this phone number. GT: How are you? MJ: Good. MT: Can do. You should find them on the site, there's no list. GJ: Look, I told Slave, whenever you think that [election results] are thin, don't sign the minutes, leave space for complaints. I: Hello? SR: You did him good, just continue. MJ: You solve me the 100 pensioners. Afterwards, Mile scorned Slave Gosev, and the latter came out of the meeting pale as a ghost, because the other local committees also said that they have heard the same. And tell him that if he cooperates with us until 5th June, we will be more understandable, because we will win the elections again and will have that in mind. How much is Zaev's place worth? NG: Wait, but racket, what is racket? What's the store name? MJ: I'll give you [the document] in person tomorrow. NG: By whom? We're letting them distribute... MJ: They should call Slave, our coordinator. You know what they did? SM: Bye now. JV: Nobody. First, Stavreski went there and nobody was there to welcome him. MJ: Who should I coordinate with? MJ: I called him, I told him. SG: No, no. MJ: You tell him that inspections are happening all around Macedonia, so he need not worry. What's this reaction about... MJ: Could somebody send the phone number of the judge by SMS... JV: I'll send you the number now and if it's possible, you have it sent to me... MJ: What does he want? Martin called. Inspectors are in the field. MJ: People... We passed by, people are gathering. MJ: Let me speak to Zoki first, to avoid any trouble. SR: What? MT: You'll vote for these.... to have [the results] cancelled? There's not a single company in Strumica that has not been racketeered. SR:...that's not my problem. All right. GJ: Hello Slave, what did you do? SM: But that should be... GJ: No... we'll see how things develop there... Conversation between Mile Janakieski and Jovo Vangelovski (President of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia) I: Tanja is there, so through Denis, see if you can influence them... Conversation between Mile Janakieski and Spiro Ristovski MJ: No, no, no. I don't know him. GJ: It's has to be like that now, because the polling stations are closed. Zoki went to the wholesale centre and bragged about the 10 MKD, cabbage was never 10 MKD. GT: Yes? There's not a single company left that has not been racketeered in Strumica... These people had been released from detention and now our people are frightful to keep watch. Want the phone number? Conversation between Gordana Jankuloska and Zoran Stavreski Make sure you're not signing anything... I'll f**k that one from Novo Selo. But sponsorship is sponsorship. You know, we had a regional meeting, and they openly said that racketeering is widespread. There's not a single company left that has not been racketeered in Strumica... MJ: Good, I'm in Gevgelija. It's too late Slave. SG: But the results are tight. We are losing by 500 votes, and there are only three more pooling stations to be counted. GT: Satisfied with this today? Could you please send inspections there, every day! SG: Well, nothing. DPL: How much Zaev costs? MN: Let me speak to the guys. SM: I have an urgent request for you. SG: The difference is tight; there are two risk polling posts in the Gypsy neighbourhoods. We should do something there, to have repeated balloting. People from your own list are blowing the whistle. There's a problem. Yesterday, we were with the Deputy Prime Minister... Conversation between Mile Janakieski and Marijan Nakovski (Commander of the Sector on Internal Affairs in Strumica) GJ: I postponed my press at 12, because I don't know how we should act, and rescheduled it... NT: Well, no. It's better if there's not much from your side, right? Conversation between Dragan Pavlovik-Latas and Nikola Gruevski MT: Strumica is on the agenda now, right? SR: He overdid it this morning. About the case \"Global\". MJ: Good... JV: ..they have initiated a lawsuit, and it's now in my court. They lowered the price of cabbage from 10 to 4 MKD, and tomorrow [farmers] want to go out on the streets and throw cabbage crops. SB: With all bells and whistles. MT: Right now. MJ: Good... ZS: I assume it's not Karpos, I meant Gjorce... NG: You should know what we are doing now. MJ: So what? We're a state, we control things. ZS: Good... MT: In the [State Electoral] Commission? SM: Yes, in SEC. SM: Menduh? SG: They are closed, but our people should make an incident inside, to have the balloting processed cancelled. Conversation between Silvana Boneva and Nikola Gruevski SB:...the companies. What should I do? MJ: You know there are 300 IDs for Strumica. I told you the other day, couple of days ago. MN: To be made or to arrive? Last time SDS had their rally, we went in, but cancelled [the inspection]. SR: Hello? GJ: We'll bring out the Roma by ears, we can't afford... Because that has happened before Mile arrived in Strumica, extortion and racketeering of companies in Strumica. I: I know, he told me yesterday. The Deputy Prime Minister told him yesterday and he explained that he had no idea how that happened. Now, the Croat says that he would go to the newspapers... that apparently this is not the way to work with companies. I don't know the reasons for that, probably only this copy is unsigned, because it's impossible for a document not to be signed, the stamp is there... GJ: No... we'll see how things develop there... The prosecutor is one of OURS... MJ: You tell me. And tell him not to worry! If he supports us on the 5th June, we'll respect that. GJ: There's a situation in Strumica that is not in our favour. I: He's using that, because Stavreski told him that yesterday, and now, just to spite him, inspections are send to his [company]. This is how things stand. Ljube Boskovski is organizing a rally now. GT: Bye then. MJ: Bye. MJ: Yeah? MJ: You tell me. SB: And he is already co-owner of \"Vega\"... There are 3,000 voters there. GJ: Important is that he wasn't elected in the first. Conversation between Menduh Taci and Bedredin Ibraimi SR: Well, if he protects his criminals.... SG: Nooo... of course not. JV: Well good. SB: Slave Gosev. NG: By whom? They say no, nobody took us there. I: And today, there are around 10 inspectors there. There's not a single man.... I told Mile, during the campaign, he lied to Stavreski so the latter would not yell at him. MT: Yes. I: Head of finance there is the president of the Women's Union. MJ: All right then. GT: Good, should I call him? NG: He's totally crushed. Mother fucking cunt. I: The Croat says that they have always supported us and have never dealt with Zaev... The line is empty. Hahaha SG: See now, boss.... GJ:...minutes, complaints... GJ: Tell them not to sign the minutes, make them do something. SG: They are closed, they are all closed. I: I was just talking on the other phone. They have threatened and have taken money for the most impossible things. MT: Vote to have them cancelled, because we have an agreement about [Municipality of] Cair. MJ: Spiro, let me tell you what's under control. Look, I'm calling about an urgent matter, about you know.... you follow me, right? Can you speak? I don't know them, but you should see which stores when on site.
