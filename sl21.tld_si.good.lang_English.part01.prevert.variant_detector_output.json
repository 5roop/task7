      "text":" The relation to what is being said and the circumstances of the spoken situation are expressed particularly through particles, which is why they are functionally very lively language components of everyday communication. With their semantic-contextual role they actualise what is worded and at the same time condense the message. The particle is one of those non-parts-of-speech that fulfils the textual role of the connector and is, more particularly, ranked among inter-predicate connectors or the connectors in supra-predicate texts. Since particles play primarily a textual role, they are also particularly meaningful words, which can be reasonably used in a text, especially in one\u2019s first language; they maintain a strong communicative (connective) role, and with this a well-marked role of influence. From the communicative-pragmatic perspective, particles are divided into two main categories, namely the connecting (text) particles resulting from pragmatic circumstances, and mood (interpersonal) particles resulting from communicative relationships. Mood particles focus either on the participants, the circumstances, the verbal process or the quantity, e.g. bogvaruj, kon\u010dno, dejansko, baje, nikar, while the connecting particles highlight textual coherence and cohesion, e.g. celo, kaj \u0161ele, druga\u010de, sicer pa, torej, etc.     The most comprehensive and functional semantic-circumstantial evaluation of particles can be found in lexical representation.

      "text":" You are browsing the archived website of 45th Week of Slovenian Drama - to visit current website, click here.     1st professional meeting of make-up artists from Slovenian theatre     Creating theatre make-up has two interlinked aspects. On the one hand, make-up is a work of art, because theatre make-up is an important element of stage expression. Its role in the performance is greatly dependent on the stage concept. Theatre make-up is typically more than just lipstick; it can even carry the greatest part of the visual image for some performances. Together with a costume it completes an actor\u2019s character. For this reason,designing the make-up for stage demands close creative cooperation with costume designers and directors. On the other hand, creating theatre make-up requires expertise in different techniques that are constantly developed. Likewise, the visual expression develops with them.In the Slovenian theatre space as well, the theatre make-up has found for itself a creative space, not only as a technical medium, but as an independent expression. Make-up artists are rarely discussed outside theatre and they receive less attention than some other creators of performances, but just like lighting and sound engineers, together with the actors they create the magic of theatre, night after night, performance after performance. When the creation of actors disappears with the applause and the bow, the masterpieces of the make-up artists disappear with the swipe of a cleansing wipe. Until the next performance.     There will be a presentation of Temptu products with emphasis on the airbrush technique by make-up artist \u0160pela Veble.

      "text":" E-journal IBS Newsletter is devoted to Slovenian and foreign scientists, researchers, specialists, students and experts in the fields of international business, sustainable development, foreign languages and public administration. The most important part of IBS Newsletter is publishing of reviewed scientific, research, professional and popular articles that discuss themes like international business, sustainable development, organization, law, environmental economics and politics, marketing, research methods, management, corporate social responsibility and other topics.     IBS International Business School Ljubljana     All authors who would like to contribute to IBS Newsletter are invited to send their contributions to info@ibs.si.     Letnik 8, \u0161t. 3     V prispevku obravnavamo podro\u010dje organizacijske kulture, natan\u010dneje dveh njenih oblik: stati\u010dno \u2013 formalne in dinami\u010dno \u2013 neformalne. Zanimalo nas je, ali obstaja razlika med izra\u017eanjem nagnjenosti do ene ali druge oblike organizacijske kulture med zaposlenimi v javnem in zasebnem sektorju. S pomo\u010djo statisti\u010dnih testov smo ugotovili, da med skupinami obstajajo statisti\u010dno pomembne razlike, pri \u010demer so rezultati pokazali, da zaposlene v javnem sektorju bolje ozna\u010duje stati\u010dno \u2013 formalna oblika, zaposlene v zasebnem sektorju pa dinami\u010dno \u2013 neformalna oblika organizacijske kulture. Ne glede na potrjene razlike, pa opisne vrednosti odgovorov ka\u017eejo na to, da so razlike med njimi relativno majhne, zato bi kazalo v prihodnje izpeljati nadaljnje natan\u010dnej\u0161e analize znotraj sektorjev.     Klju\u010dne besede: organizacijska kultura, oblike organizacijske kulture, javni sektor, zasebni sektor     Abstract     The article deals with the field of organizational culture, more precisely two of its forms: static - formal and dynamic - informal. We were interested in whether there is a difference between expressing the tendency towards one or another form of organizational culture among public and private sector employees. With the help of statistical tests, we found that there are statistically significant differences between the groups, with the results showing that employees in the public sector better indicate the static - formal form, while the employees in the private sector are dynamic - informal forms of organizational culture. Regardless of the differences confirmed, the descriptive values of the responses indicate that the differences between them are relatively small, so in the future would be expected to carry out further detailed analyzes within the sectors.     Key words: organizational culture, organizational forms of culture, public sector, private sector     \u010clanek opisuje spremembe, ki jih IBS Mednarodna poslovna \u0161ola Ljubljana uvedla v visoko\u0161olske oziroma magistrske programe, odkar je leta 2015 sprejela na \u0161tudente osredoto\u010deno u\u010denje v svojo strategijo. Na osnovi projekta Empowering teachers for a student-centred approach so vodstvo in visoko\u0161olski u\u010ditelji pri\u010deli na\u010drtno uvajati dobre prakse v u\u010dni proces in v ocenjevanje ter uporabljati druge pedago\u0161ke in organizacijske pristope, ki upo\u0161tevajo sposobnosti, potrebe, izku\u0161nje, pri\u010dakovanja, osnovno znanje in interese \u0161tudentov. Po dveh letih so opazne precej\u0161nje razlike med nekdanjim in sedanjim pristopom do \u0161tudentov, vendar pa obstaja \u0161e veliko mo\u017enosti in na\u010dinov, da se visoko\u0161olsko izobra\u017eevanje \u0161e bolj osredoto\u010di na \u0161tudente.     Klju\u010dne besede: visoko\u0161olsko izobra\u017eevanje, uvajanje na \u0161tudente osredoto\u010denega u\u010denja, IBS Mednarodna poslovna \u0161ola Ljubljana     Abstract     The article describes changes that IBS International Business School Ljubljana incorporated in its BA and MA programmes since 2015 when it introduced student-centred learning in its strategy. On the basis of the project Empowering teachers for a student-centred approach IBS management and teachers started with planned introduction of good practices into the learning process, assessment and with other pedagogical and organizational approaches that consider students' capacities, needs, experiences, perspectives, backgrounds, and interests. After two years there are quite some differences between the former and the present approach to students but there are still many possibilities to focus university education on students.     Key words: university education, incorporation of student-centred learning, IBS International Business School Ljubljana     POVZETEK Znana krilatica, da je svet postal le ena \u02ddglobalna vas\u02dd, \u0161teje \u017ee desetletje in ve\u010d. Seveda to tehni\u010dno gledano olaj\u0161a poslovanje in izmenjavo z najbolj oddaljenih koncev sveta, po drugi strani pa zahteva sprejemanje in dojemanje dodatnih informacij ter signalov, mimo katerih ne moremo. \u0160e ve\u010d: dojemanje in sprejemanje razli\u010dnih, iz nacionalnih in s tem tudi poslovnih kultur izvedenih informacij, je predpogoj za \u017ee navadno razmi\u0161ljanje o poslovanju z nekom, tako razli\u010dnim od nas. Potrebno se je najprej seznaniti in razumeti, nato sprejeti, kulturne razlike obvladovati, v\u010dasih morda, celo, ali pa tudi - prese\u010di. Za primer sem vzel ruski trg. Je velik in prav zato pomemben. Ker je velik, je tudi raznolik, v nekaterih pogledih poseben, mnogokrat zahteven, v\u010dasih morda celo zakompliciran. Zdi se, da je v Sloveniji le nekaj podjetij, ki ga uspe\u0161no obvladujejo, ker ga o\u010ditno razumejo. Posla na tem trgu ni enostavno niti za\u010deti, \u0161e te\u017eje ga je ohranjati, obvladovati in gojiti. Poznamo silno uspe\u0161ne, pa tudi klavrno propadle primere. Z enim stavkom: vse se za\u010dne in kon\u010da pri ljudeh, nas samih in poslovnih partnerjih.     Z metodami klasifikacije, deskripcije in kompilacije sem iz izbrane literature pri\u0161el do potrditve hipoteze, da v dana\u0161njem \u010dasu \u02ddglobalna vas\u02dd dejansko pomeni uporabo novih tehni\u010dnih in tehnolo\u0161kih re\u0161itev (digitalizacija, internet) pri poslovanju na svetovni ravni. Olaj\u0161uje in s tem omogo\u010da hitrej\u0161e in natan\u010dnej\u0161e komuniciranje; tudi poravnavanje obveznosti. Vse ostalo, \u010dlove\u0161ki odnosi in s tem povezane navade in ob\u010dutja, pa se kljub v zadnjem desetletju znatnim tehni\u010dnim in tehnolo\u0161kim poenostavitvam poslovanja niso in se o\u010ditno tudi ne morejo kar tako spontano spremeniti. Kulturne razlike ostajajo in kakor ka\u017ee, se v zadnjem \u010dasu s poudarjenim zavzemanjem za uveljavljanje lastnih navad in na\u010del, ter o\u010ditno z namenskim pomanjkanjem empatije oz. sprejemanjem in dojemanjem tujih, \u0161e pove\u010dujejo. Razlike ponovno delijo in ote\u017eujejo, namesto da bi bogatile in pospe\u0161evale izmenjavo mnenj in stali\u0161\u010d v iskanju konsenza in s tem najbolj\u0161ih re\u0161itev. Z drugimi besedami: globalizacija nam po lastni krivdi omogo\u010da la\u017eje poslovanje le v tehnolo\u0161kem smislu; za, recimo ji \u02ddpsiholo\u0161ko globalizacijo\u02dd, pa se moramo \u0161e naprej truditi. Pred tem pa to sploh \u017eeleti.     Razlike so seveda tudi med nami in Rusi, a jih dovolj uspe\u0161no premagujemo. Morda zaradi nekaterih podobnosti. Posku\u0161amo se razumeti in najti skupen interes, kar nas zdru\u017euje. Zavedamo se, da ne moremo mimo uveljavljenih navad, Rusi pa nas kot \u02ddtradicionalne prijatelje\u02dd tudi la\u017eje sprejmejo in pri svojih navadah morda kdaj v na\u0161o korist tudi \u02ddpopustijo\u02dd. Klju\u010dne besede: Rusija, Slovenija, organizacija, globalizacija     ABSTRACT A well-known fact, that the world has become just \u02ddone global village\", has been in existence for a decade and more. Of course, this technically facilitates the operation and exchange from the outermost regions of the world, but on the other hand, it requires the reception and perception of additional information and signals, which we cannot ignore. Even more: perceiving and accepting various, from the national and, consequently, to business-oriented information, is a prerequisite for thinking about doing business and cooperate with someone so different from us. It is necessary, first to acquaint and understand, then to accept, to cope with cultural differences, sometimes even to overcome. As the case I have taken Russian market. It is big and therefore important. Because it is large, it is also varied and demanding, in some respects specific, sometimes even complicated. It seems that there are only a few companies from Slovenia that manage it successfully, because they obviously understand it. The business on this market is not easy even to start, very hard to maintain, manage it and keep it growing. We know for very successful as well as for classically failed cases. With one sentence: everything starts and ends with people, ourselves and (business) partners.     Using the methods of classification, description and compilation, I have come to the confirmation of the hypothesis that the \"global village\" actually means the use of new technical and technological solutions (digitalization, Internet) in global operations. It facilitates and enables faster and more precise communication - including, e.g., settlement of liabilities. All the rest, human relations and related habits and feelings, cannot, of course, be changed spontaneously. Cultural differences remain and, as it seems, recently, with an emphasized commitment to enforcing one's own habits and principles, and apparently with a dedicated lack of empathy, acceptance and perception of foreign ones, are even and unfortunately increasing. Differences re-differentiate and aggravate again, rather than enriching and fostering the exchange of views and positions in seeking consensus and thus the best solutions. In other words: globalization, by our own fault, makes it easier to operate only in a technological sense; for, let say, \"psychological globalization\", we still must continue to work hard. But the prerequisite for this is wish for it, and wish and will to do it.     The differences are, of course, between us and the Russians, but we sufficiently successful overcome them. Perhaps due to some similarities. We try to understand and find a common interest that unites us. We both are aware that we cannot bypass the established habits. And because Russians accept us as \"traditional friends\", (just) sometimes let us be with our habits and they do not insist on their own. Key words: Russia, Slovenia, organization, globalization. "

      "text":" Discussion and opening: Tuesday, 5 May 2015, at 7 p.m., Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova     Duration: 5 May 2015 \u2014 28 June 2015     Curator: Igor \u0160panjol     Polonca Lov\u0161in is an architect and artist who explores self-organized initiatives and alternative forms of activism in architecture and city planning. Lately her focus has been on the relation between town and country, particularly on urban farming as a practice that could save the countryside and towns, nature and man. Lov\u0161in\u2019s works range from recycled household objects modified to promote sustainability and ecological awareness, group performances and interventions in public spaces, to photo-collages, videos and animations.     In recent years we have seen the emergence of urban community gardens, which are more than just about gardening, they are also a form of self-organizing and self-management, and a testing ground for diverse models of community living. New generations of urban gardeners stress the importance of locally produced food, keep bees, swap seeds, plant fruit trees, and transform abandoned lots into oases of gardens and vegetable-patches. Central to their work is joint action, as working in small groups can lead to gradual changes in lifestyle and culture, and have long-term effects on the economic, social, and political levels. The KUD Obrat group has thus started a community garden in the center of Ljubljana with the participation of local residents. An important element of this project has been the agreement with the city authorities on temporary, rent-free lease of the plot.     Lov\u0161in\u2019s exhibited collages place the Beyond the Construction Site community garden in the historical context of urban plot gardening. Based on individual garden plots, urban gardening has a long-standing tradition in Ljubljana, although the number of plots has dropped substantially in recent years due to the systematic implementation of a new, stricter policy. In addition to the collages, an assortment of gardening-related objects is also exhibited, pointing to the connections between people and gardens, tools and nature, and also to the history of gardening, community gardens, their rules, the process of self-organization, the natural logic of things, and nature itself. The exhibition highlights the garden as a place to consider what is beautiful and alive, what is basic and simple, and what the future of our lives in cities could be.     Beyond the Construction Site is a community garden started by the Kud Obrat group (Stefan Doepener, Ur\u0161ka Jurman, Polonca Lov\u0161in, and Apolonija \u0160u\u0161ter\u0161i\u010d) in 2010 and still developing to this day. In collaboration with local residents a degraded urban area (a long-disused construction site) has been transformed into a flourishing garden and community space.     Among Polonca Lov\u0161in\u2019s major solo shows are Every Egg Matters at the P74 Center and Gallery in Ljubljana (2013), and Elektrisierende Tr\u00e4ume\/ Electrified Dreams at the Kunstverein Gera in Germany (2011). She has also participated in numerous group exhibitions, including Measures of Saving the World_Part 5 at the Rotor Gallery in Graz (2014), at the 7th Triennial of Contemporary Art in Slovenia at the +MSUM (2013), and at the animated film festival Tricky Women in Vienna (2012). She has authored and coauthored numerous publications and received various grants, awards and prizes, and artist residencies, including the Golden Bird Award for Visual and Intermedia Art (2010), artist residency at the Wysing Arts Centre in Cambridge (2009) and the Artslink residency in New York and San Francisco (2006).

      "text":" PRME - Principles for Responsible Management Education     The SEB LU has committed itself to the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) and the Six Principles advocated by the United Nations\u2019 Responsible Management Education initiative. The PRME promote responsible management education and thought leadership. The primary objective is to develop a new generation of business leaders capable of managing the complex challenges faced by business and society in the 21st century.     The SEB LU became one of the signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) in 2009. PRME encourages business schools to integrate the concepts of sustainable development and social responsibility in their education and research activities.     In 2011, the SEB LU prepared its first PRME 2009\u20132010 Progress Report. In the following PRME Progress Reports SEB LU focused on the achievements in relation to the implementation of the Principles. All reports are published below.     PRME Principles     Principle 1: PURPOSE     We will develop the capabilities of students to be future generators of sustainable value for business and society at large and to work for an inclusive and sustainable global economy.     Principle 2: VALUES     We will incorporate into our academic activities and curricula the values of global social responsibility as portrayed in international initiatives such as the United Nations Global Compact.     Principle 3: METHOD     We will create educational frameworks, materials, processes and environments that enable effective learning experiences for responsible leadership.     Principle 4: RESEARCH     We will engage in conceptual and empirical research that advances our understanding about the role, dynamics, and impact of corporations in the creation of sustainable social, environmental and economic value.     Principle 5: PARTNERSHIP     We will interact with managers of business corporations to extend our knowledge of their challenges in meeting social and environmental responsibilities and to explore jointly effective approaches to meeting these challenges.     Principle 6: DIALOGUE     We will facilitate and support dialog and debate among educators, students, business, government, consumers, media, civil society organisations and other interested groups and stakeholders on critical issues related to global social responsibility and sustainability.     2014 - 2016     The SEB LU become the first institution in Slovenia and in the region to attain the Triple Crown accreditation, holding the three most renowned international accreditations EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA.     In 2016, the SEB LU celebrated its jubilee 70th anniversary of its existence under the slogan \u201cWe are researchers, professors and we are students\u201d. Many socially responsible events were organized in order to celebrate this anniversary.     In order to assist incoming students integrate into the country\u2019s social and academic environments and to help them join the labour market, foreign students were given the possibility to learn Slovenian by attending the \u201cSlovenian for Foreigners\u201d course in 2016.     A special team was established, namely the Team for New Teaching Methods and Technologies, in order to create a suitable environment for new teaching technologies and methods.     In the 2014\u20132016 period, almost 200 business projects were carried out as a result of co-operation with companies at first- and second-cycle study highlights.     To strengthen the pedagogical activity, co-operation with the business sector and internationalisation, the SEB LU successfully joined in three projects as part of a University of Ljubljana tender named \u201cA Creative Way to Practical Knowledge\u201d.     In order to raise awareness about corporate social responsibility, the Faculty strives to develop its own study cases, having already become a constant feature of the Portoro\u017e Business Conference.     In 2016 MSc programme Quantitative Finance and Actuarial Sciences was recognized as an academic partner of GARP (Global Association of Risk Professionals).     We have been actively measuring and monitoring the share of students\u2019 final theses that critically discuss and intertwine various approaches, thoughts and schools.     In 2015 the SEB LU conducted its first Summer school on Cultural Managament. The Summer School is the fruit of the Art Council which was founded by the University of Ljubljana.     In the 2015\/16 academic year, the SEB LU started a pilot project in order to create educational framework through efficient mentorship programme.     In the period 2014 \u2013 2016 the share of articles with the topics on ERS was around 13.8 percent among all articles published by the SEB LU researchers.     In order to motivate young researchers, additional short and intensive highlights for PhD students were developed. It is worth mentioning the Ljubljana Doctoral Summer School programme, and Global School in Empirical Research Methods \u2013 GSERM in cooperation with the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland.     In 2016 the SEB LU Centre of Business Excellence (CBE) developed in cooperation with different Slovenian and international companies\u2019 short intensive highlights on ERS topics for business community: Mercator Summer School, NLB Summer School and EY Summer School. Worth mentioned are also two projects the BTC Campus Murska Sobota and the BTC Campus Ljubljana.     In 2014 a book titled Making Sustainability Work: Best Practices and Managing and measuring Corporate Social, Environmental, and Economics Impact by Mark J. Epstein and SEB LU prof. Adriana Rejc Buhovac was published. In addition, in 2016, a special attention should be given to the jubilee anthology of the Economic and Business review (EBR) - a special compilation of selected EBR articles from past decades.     The SEB LU encouraging students\u2019 engagement related to global social responsibility and sustainability, to name a few projects: every year, the SEB LU Student Council organises a charitable educational week that features various workshops at which students can acquire soft skills. In the 2015\/16 academic year, the SEB LU Student Council raised funds for the charitable organisation Ana\u2019s Little Star; students raised a founds for the Project Human, an association helping young people struggling with different types of addiction. In 2016 on Women\u2019s Day celebration, the Management Group Association raised funds for a safe house for women etc.     2012 - 2014     opening of the SEB LU\u2019s Small Gallery     developing personal mobility plans of SEB LU employees since 2014 (this is in addition to the SEB LU\u2019s Mobility Plan)     using employee satisfaction surveys as a tool to build positive employee relations and a positive work environment     establishing the Alumni Cycling group     installing automatic gliding doors at all entrances to reduce energy consumption     finalising the reconstruction project for increased energy-efficiency     adopting Corporate Integrity Guidelines     adopting the 2016-2020 strategy at the end of 2014 with ERS incorporated into values, mission and vision as well as into key strategic areas and strategic results     the Code of Research Ethics, adopted by the University of Ljubljana in 2014, and the European Code of Conduct for the preservation of research integrity (European Scietific Foundation and ALLEA) accepted in 2014 by the SEB LU Research and Doctoral Program Committee     holding an organic-food market \u201cFrom garden to office\u201d at the SEB LU\u2019s atrium since 2014, along with the faculty\u2019s own \u201cFrom garden to office\u201d website     promoting a healthy life-style through healthier food options in the bars and restaurants on the faculty\u2019s premises (for example, a new health food restaurant called \u2018Greeny\u2019, a new \u2018Healthy\u2019 menu at the restaurant Sodexo)     promoting a healthy lifestyle through providing yoga, pilates and dance lessons on the faculty\u2019s premises since 2014 and ski lessons and other activities organised by members of the SEB LU\u2019s Unit for Physical Education     2010 - 2012     integrating ERS into learning goals and objectives of all the faculty\u2019s highlights     the Ethics Committee since 2011     the Code of Ethics since 2012     promoting SEB LU values and Code of Ethics in all classrooms since 2012     managing a special section of the SEB LU\u2019s website on social and environmental responsibility since 2012     supporting the activities of the Confucius Institute organising courses, workshops and summer schools for children since 2012     implementation of the University of Ljubljana Integrity Plan adopted to enforce the Integrity and Corruption Prevention Act from 2012     initiating a large-scale project to renovate the faculty\u2019s premises and increase energy-efficiency     establishing the SEB LU Foundation which supports deprivileged students by providing scholarships     developing, in partnership with the Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia, the SEB LU\u2019s Mobility Plan     2009 - 2010     SEB LU becomes PRME signatory     calculating the SEB LU\u2019s Carbon Footprint since 2009     promoting water and energy savings with posters, stickers and leaflets throughout the SEB LU premises since 2009 (these activities started with the Re:Think project)     supporting activities of the SEB LU\u2019s Eco Team, which has been active since 2009     providing \u2018BigFish\u2019 Bicycles, available to all employees since 2010     supporting the arts and managing the SEB LU\u2019s Gallery, which has featured a new artist every month since 2010     managing the Confucius Institute, which promotes Chinese culture in the wider Slovenian society since 2010     \u25b2 Hide     Other activities the SEB LU has been involved in continuously are:     encouraging paper and environmentally-friendly waste collection by providing segmented bins and collection points     adjusting working conditions and the working schedules of employees to operate as a family-friendly employer     incorporating ERS into course content, student assignments and in the overall curricula     encouraging the inclusion of ERS topics into undergraduate, master and doctoral theses     integrating ERS into the SEB LU\u2019s executive education highlights     integrating ERS into research and development highlights     promoting social responsibility through diverse socially responsible projects initiated and organised by the SEB LU staff and students     organising and participating in other events promoting ERS (such as round tables, conferences, academies)     providing physical education highlights for all first-year students at the undergraduate level     promoting sports activities among employees and their families with sports courses at the premises of the University of Ljubljana     supporting the faculty\u2019s sports teams     continuously improving accessibility for disabled people by adding new wheelchair ramps; the SEB LU\u2019s Centre for Student and Career Services also provides tutors for students with special needs.

      "text":" Product development: Savvy     TECOS has been offering support to Slovene and foreign partners in tooling, plastics and sheet metal processing with simulations and elastomeric analysis for 23 years. For some partners, we also provide comprehensive services, such as the development of new products.     Addressed issues     Our customer L-TEK turned to us for help in the development of a portable ECG system. This system would allow an individual to monitor their own heart and other life functions. Through an application on their mobile phone, it can detect the correct or incorrect heart function, and then can seek help from their doctor if needed. The project is called SAVVY.     Our input was the outer surface of the product. The basic shape of the product is two drop shaped elements connected by a silicon cable. The larger drop contains the electronics and battery, while only electronics can be found in the smaller drop. Human life functions are monitored through two electrodes that a person places on their chest. These electrodes are connected to electronics in both droplets via special buttons.     From the function of the product, the design requirements are as follows:     The product must be waterproof, including both buttons and at both cable outlets.     The product must be tough enough so as not to shatter on falling on the ground.     The product should be as rounded as possible, because it is worn by the user under clothing, both in daily life and in activities such as running or cycling.     The product is in contact with the skin, therefore medical material must be used which does not induce any reactions to the skin or transfer the substance from the product to the human body.     The temperature of the product is from -20\u00b0C to +50\u00b0C.     The weight of the product is very important, as the user wears the product all the time. The target weight was 21g, which we successfully reached in the end.     Figure 1: The drop shaped elements connected by cable     Solution     The construction of plastic products always starts with the known functions of the product, while at the same time the technological and technical constraints of processes and materials must be taken into account at the design stage. Processes include processing of tools, plastic processing, as well as integrating technology. The material characteristics are derived from steels used for tools, thermoplastic materials, dyeing agents for thermoplastics and adhesives used for bonding.     The polypropylene PP Bormed RF 830MO was selected as an injection molding material. The material has all the required certificates to allow it to be used for pharmaceutical and medical purposes. Bormed was a transparent material, so it had to be coloured with a green dye. The toughness and temperature stability of the material is satisfactory.     The largest disadvantage was the weight limit of the whole product at 21g. The basic thickness of the product had to be small enough so that the weight would not rise beyond the desired limit. At the same time, we had to be careful that the product had a satisfactory thickness for filling the mould cavities of the tools.     Additionally, the elements of fastening and joining must be mentioned. We had to pay attention to the appropriate thickness ratio on all the elements that were attached to the basic thickness of the product. An inadequate ratio leads to sink marks and deformation of products. Using MOLDFLOW analysis, we checked the filling, the injection pressure and the differences in volumetric shrinkages over the surface of the products. The regular model corrections and the implementation of simulations enabled us to quickly and efficiently optimise products to the desired shapes and specifications.     We had issues with the design of the ribs and other connecting elements. The ribs should be as thin as possible so that the base surface does not show sink marks, but at the same time it must be strong enough to perform its positioning function of the battery and the circuit. Very thin ribs can also not be filled or they do not have enough strength and break even during the removal phase of the product from the tool.     Figure 2: The drop shaped elements with charging station     The integration of technology into the final product was amongst the most demanding. The drop-shaped product appears very simple for manual installation, but automatic assembly is more complicated. Possible assembly operations were ultrasonic bonding or gluing. Ultrasonic bonding operates on the principle that mechanical energy at the weld site is converted to heat. The problem is that the connection energy is to be introduced over the weld, which in the case of a drop is not possible. With special construction solutions, we made the shape of ultrasonic welds in the form of a U profile with special energy routers, which enable the welding process to start at a precise location and control the flow of the molten material into the side walls of the weld.     Ultrasonic bonding is ideal for larger product lines, so L-TEK decided to change the method of bonding during the project start-up. Smaller product corrections were needed, since the bonding technology with adhesive on the joint should leave adequate clearance for the adhesive. However, in ultrasonic bonding, the product to be connected is spaced by the height of the \"collapse\". This collapse means how much material is poured and the weld is filled. The bonding of PP products is problematic because the surface tension needs to be changed accordingly, if we want a waterproof compound. This can be obtained by appropriately activating the surface with various processes such as flame activation, plasma, or corona procedure. In the case of SAVVY, plasma surface activation was selected to ensure proper surface preparation and high-quality bonding.     Conclusion     Work on the SAVVY project did not always run smoothly, but all of our partners from SAVVY, L-TEK and TECOS did their best to reach the desired design and quality. The product is now on the market and users will now be able to comment on the usability and quality of the product. "

We would like to bring to your attention one of the greatest political pressures on Slovenian journalists and the media in the past few years. On 23 November 2018, Prime Minister Marjan \u0160arec published a call on the government\u2019s website, where he discouraged businesses that are partially or majority-owned by the state to cease all advertising in the media that are allegedly spreading hate speech.     Statement of the ZNP about political pressures on Slovenian journalists and the media     We would like to bring to your attention one of the greatest political pressures on Slovenian journalists and the media in the past few years. On 23 November 2018, Prime Minister Marjan \u0160arec published a call on the government\u2019s website, where he discouraged businesses that are partially or majority-owned by the state to cease all advertising in the media that are allegedly spreading hate speech. (link)     The role of media in Slovenian local elections 2018     The mainstream media presentations of the candidates and programmes for the local elections 2018 was partly biased in favor of the left-wing candidates. Unfortunately, the mainstream media continues the trend from the National Assembly elections when they clearly and openly took a stand of the transitional left. Their political instrumentalisation was evident in the electoral campaigns especially in the municipalities of Ljubljana and Maribor.     Aktualno     Stali\u0161\u010de ZNP o popravkih medijske zakonodaje     Stali\u0161\u010de in predlogi Zdru\u017eenja novinarjev in publicistov o treh predlogih novel, ki jih je v javno obravnavo dalo ministrstvo za kulturo.     Vabljeni k ogledu pogovorov s slovenskimi poslanci v Evropskem parlamentu, ki jih bo v \u017eivo prena\u0161al www.euportal.si. Pogovori bodo potekali v torek, 2. 2., med 15.30 in 17.30, in v sredo, 3. 2., med 17.00 in 18.30.     Gregor Knafeljc, stara zgodba     Mnogi novinarji glasno protestirajo, ker je novi odgovorni urednik tiskovni predstavnik podjetja brez ene same izku\u0161nje iz novinarstva. Seveda je to sprenevedanje. V slovenskem medijskem prostoru je bilo podobnih nastavitev s strani kapitala (beri: politike) \u017ee ni\u010d koliko. Tu izku\u0161nja manj ali ve\u010d ni pomenila prakti\u010dno ni\u010d. \u0160e ve\u010d, mnogi izku\u0161eni novinarji in uredniki, ki so postali odgovorni uredniki, so bili povsem nesposobni. Da je to res vidimo njihove rezultate - naklade in branosti so zaradi nesposobnega vodenja tako padle, da se nekateri mediji ne bodo nikoli ve\u010d pobrali. Mnogi zato \u017eivotarijo in odpu\u0161\u010dajo, nekateri pa bodo celo povsem propadli. "

Methods A 4-month retrospective study was conducted. All patients who received systemic glucocorticoids for%%%2 days during hospitalisation, with%%%2 elevated blood glucose (BG) readings, were included in the analysis. SIH control was determined by mean BG levels, the number and proportion of elevated and pronouncedly elevated BG readings, and the number of hypoglycaemic events. Results 60 of 283 patients (21.2%) developed SIH, of which 55 patients were included in further analysis. Mean fasting and daytime BG levels were 7.8%%%2.9 mmol\/l and 10.9%%%2.2 mmol\/l, respectively. 41\/55 patients (74.5%) had elevated average BG levels. 45\/55 patients (81.8%) had%>%5 readings or%>%20% of all readings exceeding hyperglycaemia threshold, and 33\/55 patients (60.0%) had pronouncedly elevated BG levels on more than one occasion. 6\/55 patients (10.9%) experienced more than one hypoglycaemic event or a severe hypoglycaemia. Only 9\/55 patients (16.4%) achieved adequate SIH control according to all defined criteria.

Our pig roasters are very easy to use and require very little of your time, once they are loaded and coals are lit. And you can use your pig cooker for ANY type of meat: beef, chicken, lamb, turkey or any kind of seafood.     When we think about spring, we imagine colorful flowers, erratic weather, new life, fresh beginnings and well Spring holidays. And while we\u2019re not suggesting that you fly over to Cancun and enjoy spring break there with college students from all over, we still insist that you celebrate this wonderful season by hosting BBQ parties for loved ones and friends. Why not?     It seems like the Cuban-style roasted pork is becoming one of the best and most loved dishes served during family gatherings, special occasions and even on weekend BBQ parties. Why not?! Just the aroma of the grilling meat on a hot charcoal will already make your stomach jump up and down! In fact, even European families are also into it. And you would think only those who love Cuban dishes are its only fans!     If you are either operating a restaurant, or looking to open one, you know that it is not an easy thing to do. If you want to run a successful food business, it takes more than just a good chef. You need great staff and a signature taste that sets you apart from the competition. Barbecue is by far one of everyone's favorite dishes. This can also be tricky to make and even harder to be consistent with your recipe or taste.     If you haven\u2019t purchased a La Caja China roasting box yet, we believe it\u2019s now the right time to get one! A barbecue grill is an indispensable cooking partner that every home should have. We know that most of you use the oven to roast your turkey or rely on a regular charcoal grill for your BBQ parties. But why would you deny yourself such a great cookware that is so useful and efficient when it comes to serving evenly cooked, juicy meat? And hey, you can even roast a whole pig!     When it comes to good meals, there\u2019s few things that can beat something home cooked. Restaurants can come close, but there\u2019s just something about home cooking, a little something extra that restaurant and fast food meals just can\u2019t offer. Some call it love \u2013 either love of cooking, love for those the food is being prepared for, or just love for life.     People love to socialize, hold parties and cookouts. These are great ways to share good times and stories with family and friends.     Some common staples on these events are beer, soda and of course, the food. Have you ever thought about of how to roast a pig and having one on your next get together?     It is definitely something unique and it creates that \u201csomething new buzz\u201d all hosts want at their party.     Planning a party is really an exciting task. We like to consider different themes and prepare sumptuous meals for our guests.     One of the standout dishes in any celebration would be serving a roast pig. We all know that pig roasting requires some effort, but the results are totally worth it.

      "text":" Boris Jesih, Connections     The exhibition Connections curated by Breda \u0160krjanec, is focused on Jesih\u2019s works on paper although we cannot ignore the fact that Boris Jesih is above all a painter. However, knowing Jesih\u2019s visual world, painting cannot be strictly separated from other fine art modes of expression, in particular drawing and graphic art. Indeed, he excels in drawing whereby a line is never merely in the function of description and a colour never only an addition to the form. They are equivalent elements and the basis of his visual system.     Boris Jesih began his artistic practice in the late 1960's when the world and also our country faced a crisis. In the fine arts, this promoted the shifts which followed the principles of historical avant-gardes. At the time, in relation to the modernist tradition, the artists began to introduce in the fine arts various changes and different artistic practices as well as marginalised media such as photography, action, video, etc. New fine art genres emerged, including conceptualism, hyperrealism, landart, which brought new questions to art.     At the end of the 1960's, a new generation of artists began to exhibit in our country which the critics soon characterised as new figuralists and pointed to the elements of pop art in their works.     In 1968, the Belgrade Gallery of the Culture Centre hosted the exhibition Expressive Figurative Painting of the Young Ljubljana Circle of Slovenian artists, including Boris Jesih; i.e., the painters who had just completed or were in the process of completion of the Ljubljana Academy. What was characteristic of their works was the inclusion of images, adapted from the photographs, commercials, newspapers and television. The painting of the group which developed a Slovenian version of pop art combined with the influences of other neo-figurative genres was termed by Aleksander Bassin as expressive figurativism. The Group in a larger or smaller number held several group exhibitions in the former Yugoslavia, including Slovenia, the last in 1972. Afterwards their painting developed in different directions.     The young artists challenged the then dominant aestheticism of the Ljubljana Graphic School with strong, clean and saturated colours, large surfaces, template drawing, simplified, synthesized and enlarged forms of objects, simple compositions, dismissal of details, the principle of repetition, a multitude of images, and a larger format. The content of works also changed with the artists being interested in their reality, pointing to the increase of consumerism in the society. They began to replace oil with acrylic because it allowed unified, poster-like layers of paint while in the graphic art, following the episode of lithography in the late 1960's, screen printing came to the forefront in the 1970's.     From 1969 to 1972 Boris Jesih created in the spirit of the new so-called expressive figurativism. However, his formal concept was not homogeneous. He produced schematic geometrical reliefs of heads, made an attempt in the permutational combinatorics with computer structure, lived out in sculpture what interested him in pure abstraction, made some interesting experiments in the direction of the environment and produced paintings that were close to pop art. This idea is reflected in the motifs taken from pictures in magazines and transposed directly in his paintings.     In the acrylic paintings after 1970 he used strict silhouette depictions with a template effect. His picture space was two-dimensional and he depicted with cool colours a female figure in geometrically composed, equally cold imaginary spaces. The women he depicted were depersonalized, merely a sexual object. Geometrically abstract relief heads mainly in profile are substantially distant from optically relatively richer new figuralism and traverse in the field of conceptualism.     In early 1970's he produced permutations initially in graphic art to later repeat and also varied them in drawing. With this permutated and ultimately stylised figure Jesih somewhat summarised his former research and made a shift towards greater plasticity. The paintings from 1971 feature an attempt at synthesis of distinctively plastic and distinctively two-dimensional elements whereby the figure still remains anonymous. A novelty is a definition of space with large rectangular surfaces, and some of these paintings already contain hyperrealistic elements.     Retrospectively, in Jesih's oeuvre 1974 can be regarded as somewhat of an individual breakthrough. This year is characterised by two important exhibitions of his latest works, in Mala Galerija (Ljubljana) and the Gallery of Contemporary Art (Zagreb). He displayed his latest works, foggy landscapes in the soft colours of a narrow colour spectrum, produced in a technically precise manner with fine lines which replace a strike of a brush and with which he lays colour by colour in order to obtain a blurred impression of the painting. So his images would not be perceived merely as landscapes or portraits, the artist put a barrier between the viewer and the image. His intention was not to paint idealised scenes or evoke sentimental thoughts. Graphic intervention on the surface of a painting \u2013 different graphic symbols and signs, dots, lines, triangles, crosses, later meshes and frames \u2013 became new elements of the image through which he wanted to redirect the viewer's attention from \u201cromantically\u201d attractive landscapes to the reflection on the actual message of the painting which is in pointing to the increasing gap between man and nature.     The duality in his works brought to attention by many authors who analysed Jesih's work and which originates from the artist's personal experience and relation t0 the world, has become his distinctive sign. Sections from the landscape that he collected in his photographic archive in the surroundings of his studio in \u0160kofja Loka castle: isolated trees on the hillside, a solitary apple tree, a river, dirt roads that lead away, dirt roads with melting snow, repeat in his work so many times that they become his infallible signifier. More enigmatic are the signs \u2013 barriers that he puts in front of the viewer and the illusion of the landscape. From the graphic signs borrowed from the printing industry these transform into red drops (of blood), in the 80's in red expressive gestures or later in the symbols and signs on the membrane of the painting. He also separates nature from the viewer with simplified architectural elements such as doors, windows, meshes, or divides it into several fields. These are the artist's internal reactions to the social events, to all that which disturbs him when he looks through the window of his studio where nature awakens in silent mornings while someplace else in this world the individual's reality is completely different.     Jesih's artistic oeuvre went through gradual modifications and changes in terms of meaning. These changes are best observed on the visual membrane of his works which with years from two-dimensionality shifts to increasing organity and from graphisms to signs and symbols. The colour palette also changes until the 90's final emergence of large polyptychs of Ravines, abysses with a painful and universal symbolism. His works are witnesses and a document of the contemporary understanding of the world, the human's role in it, relation to the world. In this world, a contemporary man loses the primordial connection with nature because civilizational progress alienated him from the understanding, connection and possession of its secret powers. These were replaced with cultural experiences.     Jesih's graphic art, to which he became more intensively dedicated in the mid-70's, was produced, the same as drawing, parallel to his painting oeuvre. Although in the 1970's screen printing was favoured to lithography, Jesih practiced the latter. This best enables painting effects as well as photo procedures, which is a characteristic of his work. Graphic art also brought Jesih international fame and won him several international awards; his works were presented at exhibitions of the Slovenian graphic art and Ljubljana graphic school around the world. In 1985 his lithographs \u2013 as the works of the only artist from Eastern Europe \u2013 were included in the exhibition upon the 200th anniversary of the development of lithography in Vienna's Albertina, along with great masters such as Lautrec, Goya and Picasso.     Boris Jesih is an artist whose works emerge between the classic modernist and post-modernist tradition with a tendency to figuralism which he never directly copied but rather constantly developed and investigated in relation to topical artistic trends.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:     Improvement of the environmental footprint and resource efficiency of freshwater aquaculture and stimulation of its diversification and growth in the framework of an integrated freshwater bioeconomy strategy. Preservation of freshwater biodiversity by reducing the freshwater aquaculture impacts (e.g. with appropriate spatial planning) and assessment of its potential for biotechnological applications Stimulation of sustainable economic growth and jobs creation in the freshwater bioeconomy sector for people living in lakeside and riverside areas in Europe. Improvement of the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy. Scope: Freshwater systems host an immense biodiversity and support a multitude of activities providing livelihoods to inland populations. Lakes, ponds and rivers require a transition to more sustainable and environment-friendly productive ecosystems through optimal water management and planning, mutually benefiting the different ecosystem services by developing economic activities in rural areas, maintaining the biodiversity, and increasing resilience to climate change and water crises.     Aquaculture, in particular integrated multi-trophic or recirculating aquaculture systems, can be key for the development of lakeside and riverside areas as it can be combined with other bio-based activities, such as farming, livestock and the use of hitherto unused naturally produced biomass. Addressing environmental concerns, such as the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive, are essential for sustainable growth of freshwater aquaculture. Preserving biodiversity, including health and biosecurity issues, is also key for potential biotechnological applications that should also be explored under this topic.     The Strategic Working Group on Fisheries and Aquaculture (SCAR-Fish) of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) highlighted in a recent study[1] several issues that urgently need to be explored by research and addressed by innovation, such as climate change-related issues and issues of profitability. Research in this topic should consider the priorities of the SCAR-Fish study.     Strong and active involvement of stakeholders and end-users, including industry and NGOs, in a co-creation approach, is key for the success of the projects that will be selected.     International co-operation with partners from non-associated third countries is strongly encouraged as a win-win scenario, while contributing to the European competitiveness and resilience.     Where relevant, proposals may seek synergies and capitalise on the results of projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, its continuation European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and other funding streams     Specific Topic Conditions: Activities are expected to achieve TRL 3-6 by the end of the project \u2013 see General Annex B.

      "text":" Simulation of job execution in managed distributed system     Abstract     Nowadays, the use of computers to solve complex computational problems is present virtually everywhere. There are more and more temporally and spatially complex problems. They are solved using purpose-built parallel systems. Most modern systems of this type fit almost exclusively into Flynn's MIMD category, examples of which are tightly coupled SMP systems, loosely coupled MPP systems, and clusters. Especially in the field of scientific computation, distributed systems have become established as an affordable substitute for parallel systems. They are suitable mainly for solving problems where the decomposition into subproblems is trivial. An important difference between the two approaches lies in its intended purpose. Parallel systems are designed to speed up problem solving (to enable a faster response time of the system), while distributed systems are mainly intended for environments where a high number of problems are solved (increased throughput of the system). A special type of distributed systems are voluntary systems that allow the exploitation of computing resources (processing and memory resources). The most famous and widespread systems are BOINC and Condor. The aim of both is the same, i.e. to exploit the computing resources during idle time. The BOINC system is used to exploit computing resources in a wide area environment, while the Condor system is suitable for closed environments. Both can be mutually complementary. The possibility of examining and evaluating the performance characteristics of such systems is crucial because it allows more efficient use of computing resources. Following the example of the BOINC and Condor systems and after simplifications were defined, a simulation model was designed in the form of an open queuing network with feedback. Simplifications were necessary since the simulation model would be otherwise difficult to manage. The queueing network consisted of a central queue and working queues. Working queues receive task from the central queue, carry them out and send the results back. The model verification confirmed the correctness of the operation, and the validation confirmed correct design. The implementation of the simulation model and of the simulation were carried out in the ns-2 discrete oriented open source simulation tool, which proved extremely versatile and flexible. The queue was designed with the help of two network nodes and their mutual network connection. The serving was realized by transferring the package via UDP network connections between nodes. Based on the designed model assumptions can be made about the behavior and performance of the real model. Any changes to the model parameters that were defined (such as queue capacity, number of queues, routing type, the probability of a feedback loop) can significantly affect its behaviour. The experiment results with the simulation model provided insight into the behavior of the model as its parameters were changed. For the input intensity, the Poisson process of UDP packets were used. It was found that as input intensity increases, so does the the model load, which means that the central server unit can quickly become a bottleneck. Its load further increases the greater the number of feeding units, and with the probability of returning UDP packets to the central queue. In the case of sufficiently powerful central queue, the bottleneck may be caused by working queues. Random routing does not allow for a steady load of working queues, especially if these have different performance. In this case a rapid increase in tasks to be performed, and consequently model saturation, follows working queues with worse performance. Balance is achieved by using the \"shortest queue first\" principle in routing. Working queues in this case are almost the same length. The use of this method of routing and of working queues with different performance enables us to discover some surprising behaviour. Working queues with better performance are automatically inclined to receiving long UDP packets, while those with worse performance receive shorter UDP packets. This might mean that more efficient free computer resources tend to implement more complex tasks, while less powerful free computer resources focus on implementing less demanding ones. The designed model is not restricted to simulations of a voluntary system. It is useful in any system consisting of a central unit and a set of work units. The only requirement is that the central unit sends jobs or tasks to the work units, which communicate the results back to the central unit upon completion.

      "text":" What an entrepreneur needs to know about marketing     What an entrepreneur needs to know about marketing     06.05.2008 ob 09:53     Marketing can be compared to football \u2013 within the comfort of one\u2019s sofa, everyone is the expert, noticing every mistake, foreseeing every move. On the football field, however, there is a completely different story \u2013 the field is too big and therefore obscured, we cannot even see all the players and the opposing team, the competition, is on the lookout for our every mistake. Similar situations play out in the world of marketing when we decide to realise that first action. It is then that we find that matters are not so simple and obvious. If we embark upon it unprepared and with insufficient knowledge, the worst case scenario is that there is no response to the product and the money invested in the development and realization of the action has been practically thrown away. Another alternative is to hire professionals to carry out the action, which of course costs money but increases effect and response. What is Marketing Marketing means action: action directed towards acquiring clients, increasing sales, improving the recognition of the company, its products and its services etc. The victors in marketing are always the ones with the most forcible and effective ideas, the bolder ones, but also the more qualified\/educated. You should therefore think in terms of concrete action, using modern and innovative marketing approaches. Marketing aims at attracting attention, whether to the company products or its services. It represents a network of activities performed by the company and its employees, especially in smaller companies where practically every employee is a salesman. Irrespective of their workplace, everyone can all contribute to an action\u2019s success. Marketing therefore consists of everything that an entrepreneur does on the market \u2013 from the presentation of all documents, invoices, records, and complete business correspondence, to contacts with the buyers, suppliers, partners, potential employees, journalists, and politicians. The entrepreneur is the one responsible for presenting to his or her employees their role in the company\u2019s marketing activities: how to behave and primarily explaining what the goal is that the entrepreneur wishes to realise on the market. Only this will allow each company member to fulfil their role correctly. Unless the company\u2019s reputation and recognition is developed systematically, it may happen that the image on the market differs completely from your wishes and plans. The goal of every marketing strategy is a long-term increase of sales; however, there are differences in the marketing of small and big companies. For a small company, the first challenge is establishing a contact with potential buyers as directly and effectively as possible and, if possible, at the lowest possible price. The marketing of big companies or those companies marketing wholesale products, is usually more dispersed, while the most effective way for small companies is to achieve specifically set goals in a more direct and forcible way. What Marketing is Not Marketing does not in any way imply lying, manipulating or selling castles in the clouds only to convince the buyer to buy, even if it is done once and never again. If you know of at least one \u201cmiracle product\u201d that has not lived up to its TV or newspaper advertisement, you will agree that dissatisfied buyers are the worst kind of publicity for the product, the services or the deceitful company in general. And in addition ... Apart from all the above mentioned, it is important to remember the fact that in the midst of all this flood of advertisements in post boxes, on television, radio, and the Internet, people are becoming ever more selective. We simply overlook, we choose not to hear, or we turn off the advertisements. The advertisers have made the same conclusion, which is evident from television commercials where after they have been run there is another, more expensive one. The buyers\u2019 attention should be captivated by the form, as well as the content; the advertisement should awaken their interest and offer some kind of an advantage. This is the only way they will choose to dial your telephone number from the mass of advertisements.     Prosimo vas, da pri pisanju komentarjev niste \u017ealjivi.

In order to prevent explosions, work in an inert atmosphere is often necessary. In those atmospheres oxygen concentration is low enough to avoid ignition. Inert atmosphere is also used if we want to prevent the product from oxidizing. For devices with inert atmosphere an inertization test is performed. The purpose of the test is to verify that the establishment and maintenance of an inert atmosphere within the workspace complies with the SIST-TP CEN \/ TR 15281: 2006 standard. With this test it is also possible to optimize the parameters of establishing and maintaining an inert atmosphere if necessary (set them in such a way that the amount of inert gas used to establish and maintain the atmosphere is as small as possible, thus minimizing costs while making sure the process is still in compliance with the standard). The test is conducted by monitoring the concentration of oxygen inside the working space in respect of time.     We use oxygen meter produced by Michell, which is calibrated annually. "

      "text":" In Love With the Field     God created rainy days to allow gardeners to do household chores     Let\u2019s get one thing straight: I\u2019m not a vegetarian, I love meat. I wouldn\u2019t, however, say no to a side dish in the shape of juicy and lovely-smelling vegetables.     My mother-in-law supplied us with home-grown vegetables for a long time. At the time, I didn\u2019t pay any attention to this nor did I understand the effort she put into enabling us to include seasonal produce in our menu. But I noticed the difference when it wasn\u2019t available anymore and we had to resort to buying crops at the shop. The only thing that counted there was the colour of the products which were otherwise empty, artificial, tasteless. The first spring after my mother-in-law died, my wife Barbara and I started wondering who would work the field now. We weren\u2019t able to find any other victim, so we rolled up our sleeves.     Apart from the garden where the greenhouse cheats nature and offers a suitable growing temperature for about one additional month, we also have a field. It lies on a nice, flat and sunny piece of land in the immediate vicinity of \u0160marna Gora and with a view of the Kamnik Alps located only a stone\u2019s throw away. That\u2019s where one of the many hobbies that fulfil our already varied family life was born. The soil is fertile and enriched with horse manure from our Laki\u0161a and Lady that do their best for a large harvest.     We had no experience in the beginning and we would have been doomed 100 years ago. We would probably have needed several years to put together at least enough vegetables for chow. So, we\u2019re grateful for the internet and its forums with experienced farmers that provide all the necessary information, including diagnoses of numerous plant diseases and different ways of fighting pests and avoiding toxins, as we don\u2019t use a single drop of pesticides on our field. Talking with experienced vegetable growers is awfully useful. Sometimes the amount of information reaches the levels of a serious Big Data project. All unstructured.     As I prefer the structured approach, I keep a log of activities for every type of plant, describing when we did something and what the result was. I also make notes about what would be worth trying in the following year to increase efficiency, either in terms of time or yield. We draw up a schedule of activities at the beginning of the week. I\u2019ve put the experience of evaluating weather gained from my mountain adventures to good use for working in the field too. It helps me decide when to water the plants and determine the best time to weed and hoe, but also when to harvest the crops to extend their shelf life.     The activities start as early as March and finish in November when we ferment turnips. Although I consider agriculture my hobby, I approach it with a great sense of responsibility. This includes responsibility towards the cultivated field and care for the plants that graciously stock our pantry.     In the summer, our 10-minute way home through the village with a wheelbarrow often extends to an hour or two. The reason behind this is produce sharing with fellow villagers who gladly invite us for a refreshing drink. Sometimes an exchange of goods also takes place.     Spending an afternoon in the field strengthens family ties. We chat and come up with new plans. If there is a lot of work to be done, we make lunch on the spot. A charcoal grill and a pack of \u201c\u010devap\u010di\u010di\u201d (minced meat shaped into little sausages), while the vegetable side dish is not far away. And then back to work in the field.     Sometimes, when the heat becomes unbearable, the thistles especially prickly and midges abnormally annoying, I start wondering and get ideas about how the work out in the field could be made easier with modern technology, Big Data analysis and robotisation. The work could carry on long into the night and we would see a record yield in autumn. Precise planting, selective elimination of weeds and drone harvest are drawing closer.     But in that case, I would be worse off, as we would no longer have a hobby strengthening our family ties.     Matej Mo\u0161kon     \u017divim pestro \u017eivljenje v ljubezenskemu \u010detverokotniku z dru\u017eino, firmo in gorami. Vrhunska oprema in napredna tehnologija me spremlja \u017ee desetletja. Odgovore na \u0161tevilna vpra\u0161anja, ki se mi porajajo, i\u0161\u010dem v naravi in tam najdem svoj notranji mir. Odgovornost do opravljenega dela mi vzbuja ob\u010dutke koristnosti. Radostno sprejemam vpra\u0161anja o nasvetih po konfiguracijah, izvedbi projektov, iskanju vzroka napak\u2026 Izku\u0161nje z veseljem delim z vsakim, ki mi je pripravljen prisluhniti. "

Project description:     SAMANTHA project wants to anticipate with this up\/reskilling strategy, especially in VET (Vocational Education and Training) field because the current European VET offer has to respond to such challenges and take advantage of great opportunities ahead as the gap that exists in the Toolmaking and Habitat sector. For this reason, SAMANTHA aims to develop a novel training program addressing the mismatched high-tech T-shaped skills for proper implementation of AM in the value chains of such sectors through high qualified workers.     Project partners will develop and test 5 Intellectual Outputs (IO) over the project period: \u2022 IO1- Create flexible learning pathways and didactic tools based on the learning outcomes approach, able to provide, assess and recognize the key competences identified in target groups. \u2022 IO2- To ensure good alignment of VET programmes with the requirements of the Toolmaking industry and Habitat sector regarding AM. \u2022 IO3- To boost the Digital Transformation and the Smart Industrial Specialisation of these manufacturing sectors with a competent implementation of AM in their value chains. \u2022 IO4- To increase competitiveness and productivity of these sectors with a continuous up\/re-skilling of the workforce with the required high-tech T-shaped skills needed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. \u2022 IO5- To raise awareness and to improve the image of KETs and STEM graduates in society as a field to work in.     TECOS's role:     TECOS's role in the SAMANTHA project is to primary cover the Toolmaking sector during the development of intellectual outputs and to provide adequate dissemination among their members that come from Toolmaking sector. Among that, TECOS will help to strengthen needed key skills and competences through up\/re-skilling of the current workers of the Toolmaking industry and Habitat sector (continuous VET) and students willing to focus on their professional careers in such sectors (initial VET).     This project has been funded with support from the European Commission. For more information stay tuned on the website of the project.

Use of paradata within 1KA tool is described here >>     1KA also provides an option of turning off completely monitoring (and collecting) of paradata (browser version, JavaScript support, referral of the respondent, timestamps of answering the questions, etc.). In this case, no paradata are monitored, not even time stamps of answering the questions by pages.     In this case, a note 'Survey without paradata' will appear in the footer of the survey.     It should be added that by default connecting IP address with data in 1KA is disabled, hence the note 'Without IP tracking' in the footer of the survey.     In addition, by default monitoring of cookies in 1KA is disabled, hence the note 'Survey without cookies'. The note will disappear if the monitoring is explicitly activated.     Generally, anonymous paradata, to the extent to which user has permitted or set to monitor them, can also be used to optimize the survey process in 1KA.     Complete deactivation of paradata is very important for some surveys. To establish trust, users can check for themselves for the deactivation of each paradata, how it works. An indication of the deactivation of paradata can also be checked within the software code of 1KA. "

The only Slovene nuclear power plant is based at the outskirts of the city.     Ludvik, a former national speedway champion, is a bitter widower, who transports illegal immigrants every night from the Croatian to the Italian border with his van. His boss sends to him the young and inexperienced Rudi to serve as his assistant.     On the first drive Ludvik challenges Rudi a few times; a beautiful Macedonian girl is only one of their victims. Rudi experiences a moral dilemma. After returning home to Kr\u0161ko, they get drunk together and Ludvik accepts Rudi as one of his own. They go to races together and almost every night transport immigrants from all over the world past the nuclear plant. Rudi quickly gets rid of his moral reservations; he becomes tough and relentless.     The hope for better future, which Europe represents to the refugees, often turns into serious human drama through the depiction of the miserable existence of their \"guides\"\u2026     director's statement     (dialogue from the film): LUDVIK: Half of them end up like spare parts anyway. RUDI: What spare parts?! LUDVIK: Like spare parts. On the Italian side they drug them, they take out everything: heart, kidney, liver. Anything you can transplant. One kidney is 15000 Euros. RUDI: Are you fucking with me? LUDVIK: We are tourist guides in comparison with the other side.     Statement of the Director Passports and visas are a formality to those who have them. But the person who does not, is like a Martian, stranded on a hostile planet. In the year 2000, 36.000 illegal immigrants have been captured in Slovenia: Africans, Kurds, Albanians, Chinese, Pakistanis, Macedonians\u2026 If only a quarter has been captured, we get to the number of 150.000. Therefore, 400 illegal emigrants pass Slovenia every day on their journey to \u00bbEurope\u00ab. A lot of money for the smugglers of human souls and a lot of human fates. Kr\u0161ko is a small town by the Croatian border, known for its nuclear plant, cellulose industry and speedway races. Spare Parts is a film about two smugglers from Kr\u0161ko and many illegal immigrants. "

      "text":" Moje poro\u010dilo z What\u2019s Best Foruma o zanimivi izku\u0161nji z zunanjimi kretnicami...     I first heard AlsyVox Botticelli speakers in Munich Hi-Fi Deluxe in 2017 and since I was on a hunt for new speakers, became extremely intrigued since they sounded surprisingly full-bodied, transparent and refined, and they produced bass I have never heard from any planar speakers. Demos on following Munich shows were unfortunately less successful but I made my homework and decided to buy them. I\u2019ll not describe how Botticellis sound to me since my experience has been basically the same as other owners already reported and no need to repeat what was already written or invent new adjectives. So, I would just like to describe in a few words how my Botticellis sound with external crossovers.     If you buy AlsyVox Botticelli speakers with external crossovers, the package is called Botticelli X but they can also be bought separately as an upgrade to the standard Botticelli. External crossovers come in a high quality, huge and very heavy case, weighting 50kg\/110lbs. Speakers are finished in black plexiglass, but external crossovers are made completely from that material (aluminum is optional) and are resting on a separate isolation platforms, made from transparent plexiglass. Inside you would find only high quality Mundorf capacitors and resistors, Jantzen inductors and there\u2019s also an option to fine tune the mid and high frequencies (+-0.6dB). The topology of the crossover is patent pending by Omega Audio Concepts, also umbilical connections between speaker and crossover are made with Omega AC Nano extra cables. You can choose black color if you wish...     Connection between internal and external crossovers is simple but you need to by-pass the internal crossovers first (a quick and simple procedure), and then you just connect three cables to appropriate inputs of speakers and outputs of crossovers, and connect them to power amps. Unfortunately my experience with this beautiful pieces of equipment lasted only a few hours but still enough to get a feeling how good they are. Even though I expected they would sound better than build-in crossovers, they did surprise me since I never imagined the improvement could be so huge. Obviously the design is crucial and, as I wrote above, is patent pending.     The most obvious improvement was in soundstage width and depth. Soundstage wasn\u2019t small to begin with but it literally exploded the moment music started to roll. The sensation was like opening big doors or windows to the event. Everything became more clear and in more realistic proportions. System was breathing even more freely and sounded more unobtrusively open (and these speakers already sound very open and clean). Room walls disappeared much more convincingly, there was more distinction among the instruments and images were also more stable. Next thing were lower registers. Bass was \u201cturbo charged\u201d - much more powerful, had greater impact and control. It was like speakers were driven by a high power solid state amps. Since this is very important to me, I was also paying attention to colors of instruments, their timbre and density, and this was also improved. Not as much as bass or soundstage but tonal density was on a higher level too.     I would write more if I could listen longer, but this short audition was enough to get an idea of what these crossovers basically bring to the table. For me, they represent important sonic upgrade to beautifully made, finished and sounding Botticelli speakers. Also they offer a bit of welcome and simple fine tuning via connection possibilities and look as gorgeous as speakers themselves. Perfect combination. Yes, they\u2019re expensive but judging from this audition, easily worth their money.     Pripenjam \u0161e eno poro\u010dilo uporabnika Botticelli X:     \u201cI have been searching for a suitable replacement for our Focal Utopia EVO loudspeakers for quite a while as they were starting to become a limiting factor in our product development. They have served their purpose very well but we have reached a point where the audibility of certain aspects of music reproduction exceed their \"pay grade\". This was becoming obvious during our visits to Matej, Steve, Mike, Rob, Bob, Jeroen and \"the French\", all very different systems with different presentations, but all laying bare shortcomings in our own in house system.     I am a big ribbon fan. I have owned the original Apogee Full Range which I finally sold due to driving headaches. From memory the tweeter was around 0.8 ohms and the midrange 0.2 ohms, combined with a very low sensitivity which was estimated in the 80-84dB range and a maximum excursion of 3mm on the bass ribbon before it started to seriously buzz. It was really hard to get these to sing. I had custom better transformers made for the midrange, for the tweeter you could get away with something like a 2.2 ohm series resistor. For good results you really needed an active crossover and 6(mono) power amplifiers. But they were capable of a mind blowing sound.     Enter Alsyvox, an easy 4 ohm load, first order crossovers, 18mm-20mm excursion capability, a 94-95dB sensitivity and a full 20Hz-40Khz frequency response. We heard the Tintoretto at Bob (Rhapsody.Audio NY), zero driver integration issues, moves serious air, you will not lust for a subwoofer with these, an incredible transparency from the lowest to the highest registers, full soundstage envelopment and very fast and dynamic with real punch and impact. These are really everything an Apogee owner would have wanted them to be capable of, and I'm sure had Apogee not gone bust this is how they would look today.     I went back and forth with Bob on the options available to us and decided to contact Daniele Coen. Daniele turned out to be a very nice guy, passionate about what he does, completely understood what I was after, what was important to me and 2 weeks later a pair of Alsyvox Botticellis showed up. These honestly exceeded my (high) expectations cold out of the box, we had them playing about an hour after delivery and our whole crew did nothing else then listen to music for the remainder of the day, all of us even ended up calling home with the excuse we had to put in some overtime that day! Incredibly musical, impressive sound and just plain fun to listen to.     Being aware there was an \"X\" upgrade available to the Botticelli which consists of external crossovers with a patent pending crossover topology I was curious how much that could possibly improve the already incredible Botticellis, so I called Daniele and he offered to come over to visit us and personally install them.     One of the guys took some photos of Daniele's visit which have been posted online by Mono&Stereo. I will include the higher resolution versions here:\u201d     In \u0161e eno... \u201cI am excitedly writing this post as a Maggie fan from more than 20 years ago, a hobbyist who organised a group buy for Hovland caps from Alex Crespi and Alphacore copper foil inductors to build 17 sets of external crossovers DIY kits for other Maggie 1.6's owner's.     There was gorgeous tonality for female vocals but the big negatives were the large size of the singers mouths and lack of bass. I then moved on to stand mount monitors for the pin point imaging they could deliver, and tried my best to integrate them with a subwoofer.     Now the Botticelli X's have taken center stage on my audiophile journey. They exhibit such a well defined soundstage, that I had come up with a new term in my audio vocabulary \"Spatial Resolution\". The standard description of depth and layering does not adequately describe the sonic landscape of instruments and singers which is painted by the Botticelli X.     Whenever I audition a new piece of gear, the first track I always play is Miles Davis Time after Time, the live version. A somewhat challenged recording with sound system hum at the venue and other problems. As I listened to Miles playing, the beautiful tonality of his trumpet made me search for words to describe the experience. What came to mind was \"harmonic canvass\" and how the system presented richness, texture and above all sheer beauty of Miles' trumpet performance. The decays had a clarity and naturalness that had me ooing and arrghing.     I have always suspected from the soundstage spatial cues that the venue space was pretty large. The spatial resolution of the Botticellis convinced me more than ever that the venue was very large. A quick Google search listed the concert venue as a 2,500 seat cinema \/ theatre in Milan, confirming the spatial resolution was indeed delivering an accurate depiction of hall size     Then came Eva Cassidy's Fields of Gold vocal check. The texture of the voice, the harmonic tones of the guitar breathtakingly beautiful. The thought that I could not get out of my mind, was \"Beam me up Scotty\", I have been teleported through time and space and inserted into the recording venue, up front and center.     Glen Gould, Goldberg Variations, BWV 988 - a great performance but a so so, somewhat muffled recording. Good tube amps driving horn speakers can really bring this recording to life. In my experience very good solid state amps driving conventional speakers often struggle to deliver the attack needed to make the performance exciting. Here the Botticelli's were delivering attack at a level competitive with good horn systems I have heard.     The tonality of Glen Gould's piano reminded me of a day about 30 years ago when a Steinway trained piano tuner came to my previous home in New York to tune a very consumer \/ hobby grade baby grand piano. After tuner was done, the piano sounded like a Steinway for the next six months. The Botticelli to my ear is able to carry out a similar harmonic enhancement and sonic alchemy.     Large orchestral pieces are truly an experience to behold. The separation of the instruments, you think that you are hearing and seeing the movement of the bows over the strings. No instrument is attached to the speakers, the level of distortion is that low. Each section of the orchestra is communicating its distinct musical motif with emotion, drive and clarity to their fellow players, PRAT in spades !     For bass drum depiction, my go to track is Jamie Cullum's \"If I rule the World\" When I heard the tightness and texture, I called out to the others in the room, \"Absolutely no subwoofer needed\"     For any audiophile interested in planars, the Botticelli X is a must audition     My personal thanks to Daniele for creating a planar that is so musically satisfying that it has propelled my listening enjoyment to levels beyond my expectations.\u201d     Originalni prispevek je na isti strani kot prej\u0161nji.     Continuing Edward's report, I would like to share my feelings about the Botticellis too after an extensive 2-day-audition in Hengelo:     I gladly followed Emiles invitation to hear his newest toys along with Edward. This has been my second visit to Taiko and boy did his system evolve from the former SGM2015\/T+A\/VTL\/KEF Blade combo I heard roughly 3 years ago. My first encounter with these marvels was at Hifi Deluxe last year, where I certainly liked them but didn't fall in love with them - that has changed now.     The Botticellis are the most transparent, resolving and revealing speakers I have encountered so far. We started with some HD Tape Transfer recordings I brought along which I know quite well from home - but what I heard was so far ahead that at first I couldn't believe my ears. The texture of the saxes on a Mulligan\/Desmond recording was breathtaking, the intensity of the choir of a Carmina Burana recording was spooky. These HDTT recordings mostly sound fantastic, although at home my attention is sometimes focused on the tape noise\/hiss. In Emile's system the noise is of course also displayed, but it does not distract from the music in any way. Quite the contrary, it gave the recordings a vintage atmosphere that was kind of beneficial instead of distracting. The system was able to reproduce depth in a way I thought was not possible, on Antiphone Blues I was seeing the organ 30 meters behind the sax player and the space of the venue was clearly laid bare - proof that no sub is needed with these as Edward pointed out. The individual voices of the choir on Joni Mitchel's Sire of Sorrow (live) were clearly audible with a reach out and touch effect to them. The proof that a system is an over achiever for me is always classical. I do not listen to classical music very often, I can appreciate it though when reproduced well. I can count the occasions on one hand where classical music was played and I actually felt the urge to play more. Those occasions were a full MBL reference system, a full Ypsilon system, a Devore O\/Reference and the LV Vox Olympian. The Botticellis with the Audionet combo is now leading that pack and gets my very seldom given classical approved stamp.     I was amazed when we did a comparison of hard drive vs Tidal vs Quobuz on the Extreme. The Botticellis (and of course the downstream components of Extreme, TD12 and Audionet) were able to show the differences clearly, although as the evening moved on, the differences became notable smaller and smaller - an interesting observation. As the second day came to an end though we were so in the zone, that we didn't care what the source material was and just enjoyed everything big time - that for me is the real essence what a great system should be able to deliver.     Are the Botticellis for everyone? No, they do have a certain aesthetic which conventional cones do not have which may be not for everybody. They do not have the concentrated and focused energy of horns, but they are close. Nor do they have the super-pinpoint and razor sharp imaging of a small 2-way, but they come very close (In fact I was especially surprised at the rendering of height differences of sound events relative to each other, something I didn't expect). What they do though is complete transparency and control at any volume. They can show very high color intensity when it is on the recording, they completely disappear and have this special boxless sound to them that makes you think of a window being opened completely.     In summary, Emiles system is one of the top 3 I have heard so far and in certain areas the best. My hats off to Daniele for building an incredible speaker, every owner can be sure to have an absolute worldclass transducer at home.     Poro\u010dilo z Norve\u0161ke... \u201cAlsyVox BOTTICELLI - a brief and hectic meeting at PM Audio Featured Written by Karl Erik Sylthe     AlsyVox is a new and exciting addition to the Scandinavian speaker flora. And it was this loudspeaker that urged me taking a break from family and zoo this summer day towards the end of the holiday.     I received a very warm welcome from Paul Mortensen this day in july towards the end of the holiday. Fiery, one might say, because the temperature moved up into spheres where it has no habit of traveling in our latitudes, although this is in the South - a foreign territory to me.     PM Audio is located in Nodeland, approx. 10 minutes drive west of Kristiansand, in premises that are really a somewhat large detached house where HiFi business, listening room, cable workshop and housing are integrated in an unusual way. I know of men who would be thrown out of home because of far less gear than what we find here. But on the other hand, it is not so easy to determin who should throw out who at Mortensen's. Because PM Audio is a family business where both Marion and Paul are involved in the operation of the company. In fact, I did not find many traces of Prestbakken 26 being a residence. But this must be a very practical solution when working almost 24 hours a day, and most people lack their sharp distinction between work and leisure. There is reason to assume that Marion and Paul live for PM Audio most part of the day.     Then we finally got to the main attraction. These speakers we reported earlier this summer , and for which Paul got the agency hijacked after this year's HigEnd in Munich. He has cast a lustful look at these speakers from a distance for a few years, but the opportunity to listen to them has not flipped until now this year.     Alsyvox is located in Valencia, the Spanish city that is otherwise filled to the brim with spectacular architecture by Santiago Calatrava. But since designer and designer is Italian Daniele Coen, these speakers are referred to as Spanish-Italian, and all have model names with unmistakable Italian sound.     AlsyVox has four different models - Tintoretto, Botticelli, Caravaggio and Michelangelo. Paul has initially chosed to bring in the second smallest model Botticelli, but without \"second least\" is the most descriptive characteristic I can imagine. These 115 kg heavy flakes has a height of 1770 mm and is 640 mm wide.     The structure of the AlsyVox speakers are 3-way magnetostatic dipoles. At the top they reach up to 40kHz, while Botticelli goes flat Down to 22 Hz! The larger models go even lower, respectively. 18 and 20 Hz, still flat, with most manufacturers indicating frequency response that includes a roll-off of -3dB, or even -6 dB.     The layout Magical sound never arise in a vacuum. Therefore, it is important to present the rest of the layout that contributed to the exquisite result. Paul has been helpful, sending me an outline of the set we played on this merry Christmas day:     CD player: KALISTA - DreamPlay One (with external power supply \/ 1Farad) Mounted on a searate vibration damper in the same design as the player itself Turntable: Scheu - DAS LAUFWERK Tonearm: Shy - TACCO 12 \u00bb Pickup: Gold Note \u2013 TUSCANY GOLD RIAA: Sutherland - PHONOBLOCK REFINED - 2 monoblocks Preamplifier: CODA - 07X Power Amplifier: CODA No.8 Speakers: AlsyVox - BOTTICELLI Signal Cables: Black Magic Cables \u2013 REVELATION IC MKIII Speaker Cables: Black Magic Cables - EMOTION Current Cables: Furutech - NANOFLUX NCF Current suppliers: Furutech - Pure Power 6 NCF + TP-809E NCF Power filter: Furutech - FLUX 50 NCF Vibration \/ resonance control: PM ISOLATION and Black Magic Cones Special products for canceling static electricity and mechanical damping of connectors and cables: Furutech - NCF Booster \/ NCF Booster Signal AlsyVox BOTTICELLI plays music It started with the KKV classic Desemberbarn , where Kari Bremnes sings with Rikard Wolff, who passed away a couple of years ago. On the opening track, Wolff sings alone, and there is a rather magical presence in his vocals accompanied by a piano, and eventually also the violin. The soundscape is huge and the sound is crystal clear. The bass is cellar deep, effortless and with great authority.     The next disc on the CD player was Sheffield Labs' Matter of Time , with Michael Allen Harrison & Friends. I can't remember the last time I heard such a compelling and natural rendering of a piano, without the piano itself being present in the room.     More from Sheffield Labs - The Moscow Sessions Complete is a triple CD with works by various composers. Paul started with CD 2, and I took the opportunity for a small quiz. I met pretty precisely on dating and nation, but have to admit a little shamefully that I didn't take Shostakovich. To my defense, he had not yet developed much of his character yet at Symphony No.1. But anyway - the sound reproduction was magical. Very few are able to present such good resolution and precision of the instruments in a symphony orchestra. And again, this deep, authoritarian bass impresses, even though it is only fairly secluded in the soundscape. That's when good bass really shows up, not on megabass releases. And there was also a pretty formidable dynamic on this recording, a dynamic that really got to romp on BOTTICELLI.     A small visit of Tschaikovski on CD 1 showed that the magical sound reproduction was not a coincidence, related to Dmitri's first symphony.     Finally, Paul also had to play some vinyl. The film music from Dances with Wolves is film music with American accent signed John Barry, almost a bit Copland. Here exquisitely reproduced with great dynamics and fantastic resolution. And I am reminded of how lucrative it is to listen to this type of music when the facility is unable to convey the whole while preserving all the details, but collapses in the experiment. At BOTTICELLI it sounds fantastic.     We lift our eyes Here is the order of the wiring ...BOTTICELLI held a very compelling and impressive concert for a short hour at PM Audio. Paul himself thinks that he has now reached the finish in his quest for the optimal sound, although he is not quite done with the process of placing the speakers in the room. One of the factors he wants to work more on is acoustically disconnecting the speakers from the floor as much as possible. And when that process is finished, he is fiddling with the idea of \u200b\u200barranging some sort of mini-mass at PM Audio.\u201d     Alsyvox, Omega Audio Concepts | RMAF 2019 Posted on September 11, 2019 by Eric Franklin Shook\u2122 in RMAF 2019     DENVER (PTA) \u2014 I love big panel speakers. They play the room unlike any other loudspeakers I know of. However, the most common (and annoying) myth about them is that panel speakers have trouble producing real bass without a ton of power. Alsyvox and Omega Audio Concepts joined forces at the Rocky Mountain International Audio Fest 2019 to shake-up these misconceptions.     The Story:     In recent years Alsyvox has had many great showings around the audio show circuit. Most of these were personally missed due to the fact that I like to choose what rooms I cover at shows after all others on our writing team have expressed their own interests. Subsequently, the low draft status of my own choosing puts me at the disadvantage, as Alsyvox was never available for me to experience and write about until now. Luckily for me, this go round Alsyvox\u2019s new Botticelli X panels being held in a larger room than I\u2019ve previously seen.     I say I\u2019m lucky about the Alsyvox Botticelli X ($87,000 pr USD) being in a larger room as in previous instances I felt the previous model Botticelli (standard version) were a bit much for the smaller spaces I\u2019d previously heard them in. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they sounded lifelike and thrilling, but a little throttled by the room size. The Botticelli and Botticelli X are by company terms considered to be the \u201cmiddle\u201d sized offering in the Alsyvox product line-up. However, I do not consider them small or even mid-sized in the least, especially when it comes to how they play.     The Botticelli X is a full-range true three-way ribbon design, with distinctly higher crossover points than conventional loudspeakers (750Hz, 6000kHz), and in this new upgraded range, the ability to opt for dual-outboard crossovers which bypass the stock internal ones. Also of note about the Botticelli platform is that these are high sensitivity speakers at 94db. Making amplifier options more diverse than other panel speakers on the market.     It is possible to upgrade existing Botticelli loudspeakers to Botticelli X status by purchasing the two external passive crossovers. Each crossover is made out of CNC machined aluminum billets and uses an exclusive patent pending topology designed by Omega Audio Concepts. The crossover umbilical connection between the speaker and external crossover is made using Omega Audio Concepts\u2019s AC NANO Extra cabling.     Powering the whole affair, were a table full of Omega Audio Concepts DNA mono amplifiers, DNA CD Player, DNA Digital-to-Analog Converter, and NANO Extra silver plated copper cables.     In a static display were a few samples of the Omega\u2019s The Element(s) series of cables, and literature. I can\u2019t be certain if any of the cables in the system were from The Element(s) series as it was quite busy behind the equipment as you can see by the photos.     The Sound:     Essentially the Alsyvox Botticelli as just a single panel speaker. But how it plays the room so authoritatively. You\u2019d be convinced that there were dynamic-driver sub-woofers somewhere in the building. This is one of the largest exhibit rooms in the Gaylord Rockies Hotel, and it seems like the Botticelli and Omega Audio Concepts components and cables were seeing little in any sense of struggle. The traditional three-way crossover points found on most traditional speakers are moved upwards with the Botticelli panels. I am urged to credit these crossover points for the more full-range slam of the Botticelli X speakers, but I can\u2019t be sure. Being a generous stack of Omega Audio Concepts electronics at play, the power and silent background delivery of this pairing were top of the class. "

Even at home.     You come home, take off you shoes and slam into slippers. You're still elegant, your legs screaming for joy, as Ursanina women's wool felt slippers are simply comfortable and beautiful.     For ten years now, these women's wool felt slippers are our bestseller. This fact is not surprising, because they are distinguished by unique design, vibrant colors and natural materials. Even the finest guests will get excited when they see such splendid slippers.     Invite a friend to tea, dance alone in the living room, read your favorite book or magazine.     Yes, you will be happy to be home! ;)     Ursanina women's felt slippers are made of 100% woolen felt. Due to its unique natural characteristics, your feet will feel pleasantly calm in Ursanina women's felt slippers both in winter and in summer. They will not sweat because the wool breathes and radiates heat.     The soles are coated and do not slip.     Rubber can also be added to the sole.     Since the felt is a flexible material, the shoe is well formed on the leg after a few days of wearing. If you have a wider foot, we recommend selecting a larger number.     39 (8)     When the slippers get dusty, they should be slaked or stamped, and the harder dust is removed with an adhesive tape. How? Simply stick it over the seam, press well and peel off. Voila! The dust will be applied to the adhesive tape.     We do not brush our shoes (nor soles), as the fabric will crawl or tear.     Wash them in a washing machine, on a wool program at 30\u00b0C, with gentle wool detergent. Vacuum them before washing. Since wool slightly shrinks by washing, after washing insert bare feet to form their shape again. Then let them dry. We can also fill them with soft polybags to keep their shape. "

The medieval fortress was changed into the present-day Baroque building, which is held to be the largest castle complex in Slovenia. Together with a part of the preserved park, the castle in his rich pentagonal shape with chapel, multi-level arcade corridors in the courtyard shows building structures from 16th to 19th century. In 18th and 19th century the castle Gornja Lendava had many owners, and after belonging to one of the Batthy\u00e1ny's for quite some years, it has been sold to industrialist Geza Hartner in 1929. After the Second World War the building was nationalised and together with the village beneath renamed to Grad.

On the basis of archaeological excavations, the beginnings of the former well-built medieval centre are preserved in the remains of a tall tower, known as a bergfried. Over the course of eight centuries, a large castle structure was built, which is today considered one of the largest baroque castles in Slovenia. Renaissance palacio was built in the 14th century. In the 15th century it was connected to the ancient bergfried and the first Palacio. In that period, the chambers were undoubtedly decorated by valuable paintings, tapestries, and furniture.     Arcades in the courtyard \u2013 Source: JZKPG     Rich pentagonal shape the Castle got in the 16th century, when owned by Sz\u00e9chy family. The castle was given its present appearance during the 16th and 17th centurY. Following the attacks by the Turks, peasants and rebellious farmers, the Castle got its baroque image. Elements of other periods, from Romanesque to Baroque, are skilfully included in the castle complex and reflect the wealth of its owners.     View towards the chapel bell \u2013 Source: JZKPG.     In the 18th and 19th century it was renovated and the present bell tower was added to the castle chapel (1751, renovated in 2001), which was the concluding action of the baroquisation of the castle, performed by N\u00e1dasdy family. On the first floor, also called the noble floor, or piano nobile, the rooms are brighter and ceilings are higher to serve the needs of the lords of the manor.

In the year 1945 a unit of the Russian army was stationed here, after the Second World War the building was nationalised. New occupants moved into the empty rooms, and one part of the building was also used for offices. Between the years 1960 and 1990 the castle was left to fall into ruin. After 1995 the renovations started, which still are not concluded.

      "text":" Slovenia The Republic of Slovenia lies at the heart of Europe, where the Alps and the Mediterranean meet the Pannonian plains and the mysterious Karst. To the north is Austria; to the east, Hungary; to the south, Croatia; and to the west, Italy. Slovenia became an independent state in 1991 and a member of the EU on May 1, 2004. Situated at a cultural crossroads, Slovenia has always been a place of high artistic achievements. Arts and culture have had a special position in the history of the Slovenian nation and have compensated for the lack of its own state and political institutions in the past. A rich cultural life and far-reaching institutions, organisations, and cultural societies are comparable to the most developed European countries. In Slovenia, you can experience amazing contrasts in the same day: a morning swim in the Adriatic, followed two hours later by skiing below Alpine peaks, then an adventurous discovery of Karst subterranean phenomena and an invigorating bath in a thermal spring; an encounter with history in a lively mediaeval city and, not far away, a more solitary stroll through primeval forests or undulating, winegrowing hills.www.slovenia.si Introduction to Slovenia www.slovenia.info     Ljubljana     The capital of Slovenia is located in the centre of the country, about an hour's drive from the Alps and the Adriatic Sea.

Ve\u010d...     Opis: Drivers in public transport are subjected to lower back pain. The reason for the pain is associated with the characteristics of the physical position imposed on the worker while performing the job. Lower back pain is the main cause of absenteeism among drivers. The present study includes 145 public transport drivers employed as professional drivers for an average of 14.14 years. Analysis of the data obtained in the study includes the basic descriptive statistics, X2 test and multiple regression analysis. Analysis of the incidence of lower back pain showed that the majority of our sample population suffered from pain in the lower back. We found that there are no statistically significant differences between the groups formed by the length of service as a professional driver and incidence of lower back pain; we were also interested in whether or not the risk factors of lower back pain affects the absenteeism of city bus drivers. Analysis of the data has shown that the risk factors of pain in the lower part of the spine do affect the absenteeism of city bus drivers.

Hypotheses were tested using multivariate statistical method (regression analysis) and analysis of variance. Data were collected by structured questionnaire comprised of three parts: socio-demographic data, basic psychosocial factors causing low back pain, and incidence, duration and severity of low back pain as a result of psychosocial risk factors, was implemented. Results: The results of quantitative survey suggest that low back pain is mostly caused by lifting and carrying heavy loads, inadequate working conditions, poor physical fitness, regular nights out, shift work, and stress. Only the impact of gender on low back pain distress among professional drivers was confirmed, predominantly among bus drivers and lorry drivers on international routes. Low back pain occurrence was less common, albeit not statistically significant, among professional drivers of vans and passenger cars. Conclusion: Our study suggests that psychosocial factors are also important cause for the development of low back pain among professional drivers and can limit the quality of their social and professional lives.

Doslej so naziv pravi\u010dnik med narodi podelili \u017ee ve\u010d kot 24.000 ljudem iz 47 dr\u017eav, med njimi je ve\u010d kot 6.400 Poljakov.     Razstavo je pripravil POLIN \u2013 Muzej zgodovine poljskih Judov iz Var\u0161ave v sodelovanju z Ministrstvom za zunanje zadeve Republike Poljske. Razstava pripoveduje zgodbe o poljskih pravi\u010dnikih med narodi, ki so pomagali Judom v okupirani Poljski med drugo svetovno vojno. Pravi\u010dniki so tvegali tako svoja \u017eivljenja kot \u017eivljenja \u010dlanov svojih dru\u017ein, saj je pomo\u010d Judom bila kaznovana s smrtjo. Zaradi svojega poguma in nesebi\u010dnosti jim je uspelo re\u0161iti ve\u010d deset tiso\u010d poljskih Judov.     Danes \u017eivi le \u0161e pe\u0161\u010dica poljskih pravi\u010dnikov med narodi. Ve\u010dinoma so to ostareli ljudje, ki pa so \u0161e vedno dovolj pri mo\u010deh, da pripovedujejo svoje zgodbe in zgodbe ljudi, ki so jih re\u0161ili. Pri\u010devanja o osebnih izku\u0161njah ljudi imajo namre\u010d edinstveno znanstveno vrednost. \u0160tevilo Poljakov, ki jim podeljujejo naziv pravi\u010dnik med narodi, \u0161e naprej raste, saj se lahko naziv pravi\u010dnika podeli tudi po smrti.     Razstava, ki je od leta 2013 \u017ee obkro\u017eila svet in se je tokrat ustavila pri nas, je nastala na osnovi zbirke muzejskega projekta Poljski pravi\u010dniki \u2013 ohranjanje spomina (www.sprawiedliwi.org.pl).     Ob\u010dinstvo so na odprtju nagovorili \u010dastni pokrovitelj razstave dr. Andrej Fi\u0161travec, \u017eupan Mestne ob\u010dine Maribor, njegova ekscelenca gospod Pawel Czerwinski, poljski veleposlanik, in njegova ekscelenca gospod Shmuel Meirom, izraelski veleposlanik. Razstavo je predstavil dr. Krzysztof Bielawski iz muzeja POLIN. V kulturnem programu so nastopili dijaki II. gimnazije Maribor, ki so prireditev tudi povezovali.     Razstava bo v Sinagogi Maribor na ogled do 20. aprila 2016 od ponedeljka do petka med 8. in 16. uro. "

(is only with CN+ with closed front)     It looks in such a way from the inside:     and if one rausschraubt plastics inside (caution because of the Micro of the free intercom) and the display from the small monitor housing develops, then it fits super hinter\/in this frameworks:     and then also without adjustment by the interior one holds!     Only the small rails inside at the back of the front had to be shortened little, thus the Dispaly beautifully behind it \u201cslip\u201d\u2026     Then with the help of the mask of the housing of the display the necessary cutout mark and rausdremeln\u2026     @ruhige hand urgently necessarily!!! RESPECT Tobi     Since now the sounded \u201cdisk\u201d is missing before the display, we darkened the glass on the plate with black hue foil, become too sharp thus it nich!!! So, now then times the tail apron had off\u2026The screws above at the Ladekante and down under the apron are no problem, however the tail apron is also still lateral in the fender with 2 (!!!) Screws held!An diese kommt man nur dran, wenn man den Radkasten los macht (die Matte - mit Schr\u00e4ubchen befestigt)     and then into the narrow pit (autsch) upward through gropes along\u2026 Those are genuinly bl\u00f6d to reach\u2026 And note! = 1x Torx and 1x cross     But if one tormented oneself there through and also on both sides solved, one can take the tail apron off \u201csimply\u201d\u2026 (Request no comments on my super cleared up trunk!)     Then one measures the distances between the sensors and marks themselves, where they \u201csit\u201d are\u2026 Now with the provided drill carefully on the markings boring (if there painted surfaces is, Kreppband or sowas more probably makes more dr\u00fcber, then is it that he tears lacquer nich\u2026 But although no warranty) and then pull the Kapel through     and the sensor use (clean-press)!     and is pleased, how well that everything fits!     Then first times break and little continue to sleep and on the next day outside in beautiful weather in the text\u2026     In order to be able to work on several places equal timely and come, first times the small ones postitionieren correctly more comfortably to the whole things to and then highly take in front\u2026     -> hectar? Is also down differently than the 3 the T\u00fcer\u2026     But nevertheless it was then set up after short stably!     Country equipment\u2026     Then the front apron had down\u2026 First above the screws in the engine compartment loosen (over the front grill), the screws down under the apron and also under the engine cover (must be removed!) are still screws\u2026 Then, as it could be also different, still inside in the fender, exactly the same as in the back removes (tip: Wheels in such a way turn that one has more place\u2026). Thus wheel housings screw loosely (the mat) and again upward keys and the 2 screws remove\u2026 Now also the front apron can be taken off.     Caution: if you like I headlight wash nozzles have, must be taken off in front on the left of the hose (attention disk water tank runs empty), before one can pull the apron completely away!!!     After all sensors in the back are inserted and one the cables inward led (behind the Stossi to shift cleanly) can the Stossi again be attached\u2026     As small tip: at the rear left down there is a large rubber plug (plug), by which one can lead the cables inward. Comes directly in the trunk raus\u2026     Then our PAT was added as support     Then with Marco first times the instrument panel apart-built:     Afterwards both looked for an entrance to the engine compartment, in order also from here late cables through to lead\u2026 Sign     Tip: Plug at the rear left a little downward in the engine compartment     Tobi with tinker (a sensor was unfortunately nich completely ok)     And Pat was gladly, finite as it after longer fight the glove subject raus had!!!     hen also again the sensors similarly in the back insert:     And Marco was still at fighting with the instrument panel\u2026     Then still another clean \u201cwiring harness\u201d from the 4 sensor cables tinker:     the interior to the cable through-lead prepare     und den Platz f\u00fcr die Steuereinheit \u00f6ffnen, vorbereiten (bei mir hinten links) und Kabel rausleiten...     then the cables into the interior through-lead     make a clean wiring harness from the 4 cables for also far, so that everything can be shifted cleanly:     and the cable cleanly lay\u2026     then still the cable to the display in the roof lay and cultivate     and PAT is in good spirits     after the display sits     o build the instrument panel fast again together, even if some corner were to be blocked nich completely so easily\u2026     and our Tobi rooted itself already times by the connection diagram and the cable chaos, so that then also everything can be attached correctly\u2026     during its I times to made yourself to remove the lights so that we can see, which cable (color) at which pear arrives\u2026     But the Frontstossi was still nich again to     even if Pat assemble already again with from the instrument panel were\u2026     and Kati screwed the lamps together again, after we had checked the lines     and I have the thing again inserted\u2026     Marco has itself then fallen on the control unit and begun to attach\u2026     and one can let the picture well stand without words\u2026     Since the sensors with lighting are, also connections had to be put to the light on the right side:     Hose of the headlight nozzles nich forget again to attach\u2026     and the Stossi again to installs push (simply drauf)     Marco has in the time further with the connections fought\u2026     Then also naturally also again the wheel housings (mat) bolt on!     Tobi has first times its earned P\u00e4uschen made\u2026     \u2026 and then again with Marco further attached.So\u2026 Still firmly screw the engine cover and good\u2026     Juhuuuuuuuu!!! Finally river on the display!!!     and my small becomes again ever completely\u2026     Unfortunately we noticed then that the sensors also flash in the case of normal drive (e.g. 5x blue with brake and left in each case or right red also with flash), so that we had to integrate still another switch, in order to switch the Dinger on and out\u2026     Thus the center console must raus, in order to insert a switch\u2026     After long superior we on the fact agreed that the best place is with mine under the BRANCH switch in the picture switch, where the Abarth has its mechanism key\u2026     Thus the Dremelmeister had again ran\u2026     Now still insert the switch and to solder cables (caution because of the plate, dirket under the switch sits!!!)\u2026     \u2026 and finished!     Then Marco has the switch built in the circuit and now still accordingly does everything\u2026 As soon as the reverse gear is inserted, activate the system automatically and if I need it for in front, simply switches on and 6 seconds on the brake, then are active the sensors\u2026     Evo preveden \u0161e tole ponovno se OPRAVI\u010cUJEM \u010de kj ni ql....

      "text":" The Hamar people are the largest and ethnologically strongest group living by the Omo riverside. The most interesting part of their culture is the initiation ceremony for young boys called \u201cbull jumping\u201d. I myself was a spectator of numerous of these ceremonies and each and every time I was surprised, how so many unmarried girls would willingly take part in these ceremonies. The unmarried boys in these ceremonies whip the unmarried girls, if they wish it, on their backs and blood just comes pouring out like in fountains. The boys just stand there and watch them, without even a liny blink of an eye. Unbelievable...     The Mursi people are said to be the most feisty and even most wild Omo riverside population. But even the feistiness of these people won\u2019t help, when the river will be much drier, thanks to the newly build hydroelectric power plants and cotton fields that will occupy most of the water supplies of their river. They don\u2019t even suspect, what awaits them. The Mursi people still look from above when they see visitors and tourist, even though these became their main and only serious source of income. But how long will this last?     The small Arbore people live on an equally very small-scaled region, some kilometers away from the Omo River, which makes them fare more water independent than most of the other living cultures in this region. Even now, they are used to heavy droughts and rely on underwater water supplies from wells. But with the drastic sinking of the Omo River water supply, even the underwater supplies of the life giving river will become much scarcer.     Written by Arne Hodali\u010d, photo Arne Hodali\u010d and Katja Bidovec     Arne Hodali\u010d     My life-motto is \u201cYou can sleep when you\u2019re dead!\u201d and I stick to it every day in my life! I worked with the Company \u201cOur Space appliances\u201d for many years now, and together we have prepared numerous successful events, lectures and team-building articles for you to enjoy and read. The best part of it all is when Jure (the CEO of Our Space appliances) comes to visit my family and me at the seaside and together we can grill a tasty fish or 2. That\u2019s when life becomes even better\u2026 "

Ta je dolo\u010dila, da dr\u017eave \u010dlanice izmenoma prevzemajo funkcijo predsednika Sveta ministrov za dobo \u0161estih mesecev. Svet Evropske unije je decembra 2004 sprejel odlo\u010ditev, da bo Slovenija predsedovala Svetu EU v prvem skupinskem predsedovanju skupaj z Nem\u010dijo in Portugalsko in sicer v obdobju od 1. januarja 2008 do 30. junija 2008. V \u010dasu predsedovanja ima Slovenija tri pomembne skupine nalog: (1) vodenje dela vseh sestav Sveta EU in Evropskega sveta, (2) zastopanje Sveta EU v odnosu do drugih institucij EU in (3) zastopanje Evropske unije v mednarodni skupnosti. Predsedovanju Svetu EU pomeni za Slovenijo pomembno politi\u010dno priznanje. V letu 2007 se je kot prva nova \u010dlanica izkazala s hitrim in teko\u010dim prevzemom evra. Tudi v predsedovanje vstopa kot prva izmed novih \u010dlanic. Predsedovanje je potrditev, da je Slovenija dr\u017eava, ki ji Evropa zaupa in jo obravnava kot stabilno politi\u010dno tvorbo, sposobno odgovornega nastopanja na mednarodnem prizori\u0161\u010du.

Ta predstavlja zagon, gibanje, energijo, voljo, mo\u010d in aktivno vlogo Slovenije pri predsedovanju EU. Tudi napis na kovancu \u201cFacta loquuntur\u201d (\u201cDela govorijo\u201d) pojasnjuje te\u017enjo, da bo predsedovanje EU usmerjeno k rezultatom in uspehom.

In December 2004, the Council of the European Union adopted the decision that Slovenia will preside over the EU Council from 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2008 together with Germany and Portugal in the first joint presidency. Slovenia will have three important groups of duties during its presidency: (1) managing the work of all structures of the Council of the European Union and the European Council, (2) representing the EU Council in its relations with other EU institutions and (3) representing the EU in the international community. The presidency of the EU Council is an important political honour for Slovenia. In 2007, Slovenia became the first new Member State to adopt the euro, a process which proved to be fast and efficient. Slovenia will also be the first new Member State to serve as president. The presidency is confirmation that Slovenia is a country that Europe trusts and treats as a stable political institution capable of responsibly representing Europe on the international stage. To mark Slovenia\u2019s presidency of the European Union, the Republic of Slovenia has issued collector coins with a \u201cdynamic\u201d EU star in the form of a windmill on the front side. The star represents Slovenia\u2019s initiative, movement, energy, volition, strength and active role during the EU presidency. Furthermore, the inscription on the coin \u201cFacta loquuntur\u201d (\u201cworks speak\u201d), indicates that the EU presidency will be geared to results and success. On the reverse side, 27 dynamic stars represent the 27 EU Member States.     Nominal value EUR 100, Weight 7 g, Diameter 24 mm, Purty Au 900\/1000, Issued: 5.000 coins     Original design: Gorazd U\u010dakar, Ljubljana Production and minting: Royal Dutch Mint, the Netherlands     900\/1000 "

Usage of 'location' question type     In selection of all question types that is opened when creating a questionnaire in column on the left, question type 'location' is available. Location is a special type of question that has two ways of inserting location: 'My location' and 'Multilocation'.     My location     My location enables recognition of current location of respondent. Focus on the map is pre-set to Slovenia, but it can be changed by using button \u00b4Set focus\u00b4. When this button is used, map becomes clickable in focus can be set anywhere. Query about current location and search box are also pre-set. Furthermore user can enable showing of subquestion that is shown on the map as a cloud with an input field.     Multilocation     Multilocation allows respondents to mark several places shown on the map. This kind of a question is especially useful when respondent is asked about more than one location eg. which places respondent has visited in the last year. Focus on the map is pre-set to Slovenia. Query about current location and show of search windows are also pre-set. Highest number of possible answers is pre-set to three (3), but this can be changed using a drop down list. Show of subquestion in the shape of a cloud with input field can be enabled.     With both options of location input, two columns are created in data overview: \u201cAddress\u201d and \u201cCoordinates\u201d. Column \u201cValue\u201d is only shown if subquestion is enabled. Entered addresses and coordinates are in form of a link to pop up windows with the map and markers of each respondent. Results in analyses are shown in a similar way with a difference that icon \u201cGoogle Maps\u201d is added in far left cell that works as a link to pop up window with a map of all answers\/markers for each variable.     Choose a location     The 'Select Location' option offers the respondent a pre-tagged values or points on the map, where he can enter his answer. To get this option, you can select the 'Location, GPS' question and select 'Select Location' from the three options of 'Subtotal question'. This type of question is useful when the survey editor wants to illustrate a specific path and\/or more locations on the map. The question allows the survey editor to add values or markers with clicks on the map, and tools in the toolbar enables him to draw on the map. You can draw the path by clicking on the 'Pencil' button and then click on the map where you want the path to take place. With more clicks, you can make turns and accurately mark the path. When you press the 'Pencil' button again, you finish drawing the path. A field appears to enter path\u2019s name and the 'Trash' button, if you would like to delete the marked path. The legend explains that the 'Pencil' button means the ending of the drawing, the 'Marker' button adds the marker, and the 'Line' button adds a line. As mentioned above, a marker and a line can also be added to the address that serves as information or label. It is worth pointing out that the line is not a value, but only additional information to the respondent (e.g., illustrating several possible paths). As with the Multi-location sub-tag-marker entry, an additional question can be added in the settings in the field. The results are drawn in the form of coordinates in the data table. "

      "text":" The \u017di\u010de Charterhouse     \u017di\u010dka kartuzija. The monastery was established in the mid-twelfth century as the 19th Carthusian monastery and the first Carthusian monastery out of the traditional \"carthusian countries\". Remains of the monastery \u017di\u010dka kartuzija are located 4 km south-west from Slovenske Konjice.     The \u017di\u010de Charterhouse (Latin: Domus in Valle Sancti Johannis) was a Carthusian monastery or charterhouse in the narrow valley of \u017di\u010dnica Creek, also known as Saint John the Baptist Valley (Slovene: dolina svetega Janeza Krstnika) after the church dedicated to John the Baptist at the monastery near the village of \u017di\u010de (German: Seiz, formerly Seitz)[2] in the Municipality of Slovenske Konjice in northeastern Slovenia. The charterhouse was founded between 1155 and 1165, and was the first Carthusian monastery in the German sphere of influence of the time, and also the first outside France or Italy. The monastery also had one of the first pharmacies in what is now Slovenia. The monastery was abolished in 1782, but the buildings survive or are being recreated.     The \u017di\u010de Charterhouse was founded between 1155 and 1165 by Ottokar III of Styria, the Margrave of Styria,and his son Duke Ottokar IV of Styria, of the house of Traungau, both of whom were buried there.The monastery was settled by Carthusian monks from the Grande Chartreuse in France (Ecclesia Maior), which also financed the construction, led by Master Aynard, and influenced the arrangement of the premises. As with French charterhouses, two monasteries were built here: the upper one (the \u017di\u010de Charterhouse), where the cloister monks lived according to the strict rule of the Carthusians; and the lower one in the village of \u0160pitali\u010d for the lay monks, who spent less time in prayer and worked as craftsmen, supporting the upper monastery and contributing to its prosperity. The monastery church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist was consecrated on 24 October 1190 by Patriarch Berthold of Aquileia. At the time of the Great Schism in the western Roman Catholic church in the 14th century, the \u017di\u010de Charterhouse became the seat of the Prior General of the Carthusian order for a while in 1391. The monastery was attacked during an Ottoman raid in 1531. This marked the beginning of a decline in its influence and fortunes. In 1564 it passed into the hands of commendatory abbots and in 1591 to the Jesuits of Graz. It was recovered by the Carthusians in 1593, after which it prospered again. In 1782 Emperor Joseph II abolished the monastery, one of the earliest to be dissolved under the Josephine Reforms. The charterhouse was allowed to fall into decay. The ruins were bought from the religious foundation in 1826 by Prince Weriand of Windisch-Graetz and remained the property of this family until the end of World War II. Now the owner is the Municipality of Slovenske Konjice.     The following legend is a pseudoetymology of the monastery name. When the Margrave of Styria Ottokar III returned from the Second Crusade, he wished for some relaxation and therefore visited Leopold from Gonobitz to go hunting on Mount Konjice (Slovene: Konji\u0161ka gora). Coincidentally he came to a shady hollow in the south part of the mountain, where suddenly an extremely white hind appeared in front of him. He followed it as bewitched on his horse, but because he was not able to catch it he fell asleep in the shade on the hot summer afternoon (on St. John the Baptist's day). A man in a white fur coat appeared in his dream and revealed himself as St. John the Baptist, ordering him to build a monastery on this place. At that moment a rabbit jumped into Ottokar's lap because it was frightened by the hunter's screaming. The saint's image disappeared and Ottokar shouted: \"A rabbit, look, a rabbit!\" Because of this rabbit the monastery was called \"Seiz Charterhouse\" (the Slovenian pronunciation of rabbit, zajec, is written Seiz in German) for a long time and has the initial \"S\" in its coat of arms.     Soon the monastery became a center of culture and politics in its territory and far beyond. The Carthusian Prior General from \u017di\u010de, Stephen Maconi, a friend of Saint Catherine of Siena connected the politically and ecclesiastically divided continent of Europe from this place. In the 14th century the monastery had a library of over 2,000 volumes (mostly manuscripts) which was larger than all but the Vatican library. On 30 May 1487, the visiting Bishop of Caorle stayed at the \u017di\u010de charterhouse as an emissary of the Patriarch of Aquileia. His secretary Paolo Santonino wrote in his Itinerary[6] that the monks had more than 2,000 volumes (manuscripts). Now only 120 are known, with fragments of a further 100 or so. In the mid-16th century, as the result of a number of tragic events in the preceding half-century, the monastery was nearly abandoned and Archduke Charles II of Styria ordered the books to be moved to the library of the Jesuit College in Graz.     \u017di\u010de manuscripts: the Carthusian order never preached religion through the spoken word, but took to spreading it in writing, accepting into the order only people with a good knowledge of foreign languages (mostly German, Latin, and Greek) and exemplary writing skills. They devoted a large part of their lives to producing precise copies of existing texts as well as creating new ones on a wide range of topics, from theology to astronomy, from practical sciences to those more literary in nature. Among the texts still in existence are many notable works which are part of the intellectual heritage of this region and the wider Middle-European sphere. Despite the loss of most of the manuscripts, the remnants of impressive library can still provide a valuable insight into several centuries of continuous development of the medieval book. Today about 120 manuscripts and 100 fragments are known. This is only a fraction of the whole, and even this small part is almost entirely outside Slovenian borders. Yet this is the only group of medieval manuscripts from Slovenia, making it possible to follow nearly four centuries of unbroken manuscript production within one monastic community. The manuscripts from the \u017di\u010de Charterhouse include many notable texts written by authors living in \u017di\u010de or the nearby Jurklo\u0161ter Charterhouse. Examples include texts by Phillip of \u017di\u010de (Seitz), Nicolaus Kempf, and Sifried of Swabia. Several of these manuscripts are also signed by monks or copyists from outside, who were probably benefactors, and their hand-written works makes of rich palette of paleographical forms. It is also the only group of manuscripts in Slovenia which is complete enough to follow the development of flourished (penwork) initials and consequently to speak about the \"\u017di\u010de style\". Some manuscripts also display colourful painted initials and other illuminated elements, created by professional and\u2014as was common practice in those times\u2014by itinerant painters. "

Join us for some new experiences!     A class for both leaders and followers. No partner required. The number of participants is limited to 28.     Saturday: Good morning bodywork     Duration: 60 min     Tango can be challenging: we often tense muscles, don\u2019t use organic methods or forget to breathe. Other disciplines can help. In this class, we will prepare for the dance with yoga and spiral-dynamics based bodywork. Our goal is a warmed-up, flexible body with a good balance and as much relaxation as possible. This is actually how we should start every day.     A class for both leaders and followers. No partner required.     Saturday: Crazy crosses for Milonga     Duration: 2 x 90 min     Discover playful versions of crosses that are suited for lively milongas. A simple diagonal cross can spice-up your dance, if you vary it in all possible ways, also by inserting traspi\u00e9s.

The number of participants is limited to 14 couples.     Sunday: Entradas for the social dance     Duration: 2 x 90 min     In this class, we will define Entradas properly and distinguish them from Sacadas, work on a proper technique and apply the Entradas in simple and more challenging situations. Given time, we will present one or two dynamical variations to spice up your dance.     For this class, you need to register with a partner. The number of participants is limited to 14 couples.     About Detlef & Melina     We are proud to have Melina Sed\u00f3 and Detlef Engel teaching at Festivalito Rural. Again. Here's some basic information about them, taken from their webpage:     Stylistically, they are at home in the traditional tango de sal\u00f3n, as it is danced in Buenos Aires, and which they interpret in a very personal and modern way. Their dance captivates through its intimate embrace, playful musicality and an almost puristic elegance: a harmonic interplay of two equal partners without superficial effect. Thus, their tango is newly created in every single moment, and does not just express the music, but genuine feeling.     At the core of their lessons, which are always geared towards improvisational capability, are intensive body work and analysis of tango\u00b4s structures. But \u201etechnical\u201c understanding is just a means to concentrate better on the essential: developing one\u00b4s own style and relishing the embrace in unison with the music.     If you need proof that they are welcome in many places around the world, take a look at their references.     If you like to read, check out Melina's blog. In there, you'll find her opinion on almost anything \u2026 also on Festivalito Rural ;-)     Finally, if you're more of a visual type, here's a starting point for browsing YouTube: Detlef and Melina dancing to Tormenta of Carlos di Sarli at the Festival de Kerallic in France. Watching the video you will surely realise why a blog linking to this video calls them those masters of control ;-) "

If you're like us, there's a reason you're not using your old-style wind jacket more. With waterproof jackets like the Castelli Idro being lighter and more compact than ever, we felt it was time to reinvent a classic.     In reality, the Aria Shell Jacket is very different from your flappy old jacket that either didn't protect you or didn't breathe. This jacket is an impossibly light layer that keeps the wind off the front of your body while allowing ample breathability through the mesh side panels. But what you'll really appreciate is how we use the stretch panels in the sides and on the back of the sleeves to make this jacket fit like a second skin: no flapping fabric, no cold air circulating inside the jacket, no more looking like a throwback to the Armstrong era.     This jacket is light and warm enough to wear for the entire ride in mild conditions, but if you do want to take it off it folds into a side panel pocket and stuffs away in minimal space in your pocket or seat bag.     WHAT IT IS An extremely light and packable wind shell that fits close to body, with stretch breathability panels, allowing you extend the temperature range of your favorite Castelli pieces.

It is well connected to the motorway network and rail. It is also easily accessible by plane from different carriers on the domestic airport in Ljubljana Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik as with many others in the vicinity - Zagreb, Trieste, Venice, Klagenfurt, Graz ...

Some can be elegantly avoided and view some part of the Alps. Hungarians have also vignettes: 10 day vignette costs 9.54 EUR in HUF.

      "text":" About this website     This website provides information about cross-border healthcare for all citizens in Slovenia and for all visitors to Slovenia.     Web Content Viewer     Professional liability insurance for healthcare professionals     Health-care workers may independently provide any service for which they have an adequate education and for which they are qualified and have adequate equipment available. They assume ethical, professional, criminal and material (damage) responsibility for their work. Health-care workers must be insured against liability for damages (cases of compensation claims by patients or their relatives) as the insurance of their professional liability is mandatory. Doctors working directly with patients must be insured against liability for damages that might arise from their work. Employed doctors are insured by a health-care service provider as their employer, while private doctors are self-insured. If a compensation claim results from a professional error in performing a health-care activity or service, the costs incurred will be covered by the insurance company. Thus, in the case of a compensation claim, the insurance company with which a health-care worker has concluded a professional liability insurance will consider the claim and, in certain cases, will be liable for civil proceedings of the insured and the costs of the defence of the insured in criminal proceedings. An injured patient may also file a claim directly with the insurance company with which the professional liability of the health-care worker is insured. With the insurance, a health-care worker or a health-care service provider (legal or natural person) insures his\/her property and property interest. Thus, an insurance company is liable for damages arising from the claims of patients or their relatives brought against a health-care service provider (to the employer of the employed health-care workers or to an individual private health-care worker) due to legally recognised personal damage resulting from the actions of health-care workers for which the health-care service provider is liable in relation to the provision of health-care services (health-care in its broader sense). The insurance sum for doctors (and dentists) should be fixed according to individual specialisations annually by the Medical Chamber of Slovenia. The last decision issued in 2001 stipulates that a doctor (and a dentist) who is in direct contact with patients shall be insured against liability for damages that might arise from his\/her work for a minimum sum of 3,000,000 SIT (former Slovenian currency), i.e. EUR 12,519). This sum was to be applicable in 2001 for all specialisations. The decision is still in force, but in practice, health-care providers make arrangements directly with insurance companies where the insurance sums are significantly higher. It should also be noted that insurance companies have different general terms and that some insurance companies have no coverage, for example, for damages resulting from the violation of the explanatory obligation. More detailed information on the insurance of professional liability of specific health-care workers may be obtained from the health-care service providers where the relevant health-care workers perform health-care services.

      "text":" The Temporary Slovene Dance Archive (TSDA) was established in 2012 when Rok Vevar, its founder, started to compile the documentary and audiovisual archive of contemporary dance as his personal cultural-activist project. The TSDA stemmed from his own need for documentary records and an archive, and out of his own curiosity about the history of the artistic practices and the community.     The aim of the TSDA is the historicisation of contemporary performing arts and covers mostly the material regarding contemporary scenic arts, dance and theatre of the non-institutional scene in Slovenia. Since March 2018, it is located at the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova (MSUM) in Ljubljana. With its curator present, it is a performative installation, a live archive-in-progress.     Contents     Background     Rok Vevar, born 1973, is a contemporary dance historian and archivist. He has dedicated a great deal of time and effort to create a historical overview of the development of dance in Slovenia, in the process of compiling his own documentary and audiovisual archive. In 2012, he opened his private collection, called the Temporary Slovene Dance Archive, to the public in his apartment in Ljubljana.     Mission     Over time, the TSDA has evolved into a platform for documenting and historicising contemporary dance and scenic arts in Slovenia, mainly practices that are closely linked to modernism, historical avant-gardes, neo-avant-gardes, retro-gardes and contemporary art. For the most part, these are scenic artistic practices transpiring outside the cultural institutions, and as a consequence, have been left by the wayside as far as public institutional archives and records departments are concerned.     The TSDA references artists and their practices that are not only present in Slovenia but are internationally extremely active and dynamic, despite the fact that, for the most part, they are institutionally under-represented. In this respect, the TDSA is an emancipatory, activist project aimed at making marginalised artistic practices more visible and providing study material for artists, theorists and historians.     Collection     The TSDA is comprised of a massive collection of materials which includes printed material, in-house process documentation, a register of Slovene dancers and choreographers, correspondence between artists and producers, photographic and audiovisual material, choreographers; and artists; files, dance festival catalogues, dance films, footage of performances, contemporary dance pedagogy programmes and a variety of other objects related to relevant artistic practices.     Location     In March 2018, the Temporary Slovene Dance Archive was transferred into the keeping of the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova (MSUM) in Ljubljana. The invitation of the MSUM represents the first bona fide initiative on the part of a cultural institution in the Balkans to offer its capacities to this type of work, materials and use.     The archive is accessible on the first floor, where Vevar also performs a live archive-in-progress: the archiving procedure \u2013 from collecting and systematising to providing public accessibility \u2013 is all made visible. The TSDA has thus become a performative, time-specific and site-specific installation presenting the archive as a structure evolving over time and without end.     Networking     The TSDA is also linked to the group of dance archivists, theorists and historians who, since 2013, have been working on the project \"Archiving Choreographic Practices in the Balkans\", initiated by the Balkan dance network called the Nomad Dance Academy.     The Temporary Slovene Dance Archive (TSDA) was established in 2012 when Rok Vevar, its founder, started to compile the documentary and audiovisual archive of contemporary dance as his personal cultural-activist project. +     The Temporary Slovene Dance Archive (TSDA) was established in 2012 when Rok Vevar, its founder, started to compile the documentary and audiovisual archive of contemporary dance as his personal cultural-activist project. +     Has subobject\"Has subobject\" is a predefined property representing a container construct and is provided by Semantic MediaWiki.

It offers a wide range of functions at all GIS levels: data acquisition, data manipulation, graphical re\u017dpresentation and quantitative analysis. The paper presents R as an open source alternative to the existing commercial GIS software. It proves especially well when advanced quantitative methods on spatial data are needed (e.g. spatial modelling).

WHO DOES THE CESL PROTECT IN B2B TRANSACTIONS?     An insight in the economic analysis of certain issues, related to the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller pursuant to the CESL     Laura Ratniece     The aim of this article is to find out, which of the parties \u2013 the seller or the buyer \u2013 the CESL protects more in the B2B transactions. In order to achieve the aim, the author has given an insight in the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller from the viewpoint of the economic analysis of law. The author has focused on the main aspects of the relevant regulation of the CESL, related to the 1) contract formation; 2) burden of proof; 3) duty to inspect the goods; 4) remedies, which help to characterize and analyse the legal relationship between the parties of a sales contract.     \u00bbLaw needs economics to understand its behavioural consequences, and economics needs law to understand the underpinnings of markets.\u00ab1     1. INTRODUCTION     On October 11th 2011, the European Commission proposed a new regulation \u2013 \u00bbCommon European Sales Law\u00ab (CESL), at the same time indicating that \u00bb[t]he optional Common European Sales Law will help to break down the trade barriers (\u2026)\u00ab.1 The European Commission has researched that nearly 99 percent of the companies, registered in the European Union (EU), cannot afford to trade across the EU borders because selling abroad means adapting sales contracts for up to 26 different legal systems.2 Thus, it can be concluded that the CESL proposal was created, inter alia, to increase trade among merchants in the territory of the EU.     CESL contains diverse legal rules: some can be related only to business to consumer (B2C) transactions, some regulate only business to business (B2B) transactions, and the rest can be applied to both B2C and B2B transactions. In this article the author will focus only to B2B transactions, as they are the main object of international commercial law.     As each sale transaction is carried out by two parties \u2013 a buyer and a seller, it is important to understand their legal relationship. If it is possible to determine, which of the parties is weaker and, thus, should be more protected, it is possible to evaluate the efficiency of the particular legal act, which regulates the particular legal relationship (transaction). The legal relationship between a buyer and a seller can be determined, by analyzing several legal issues, inter alia, from an economic perspective. As a result, it can be stated how the relevant regulation affects, for example, the allocation of risks among buyers and sellers, legal certainty and the transaction costs of parties, thus allowing to evaluate the overall efficiency of the transaction.     One of the most appropriate methods of research and analysis of this particular issue is the economic analysis of law. The economic analysis of law means \u00bbthe use of economic principles and reasoning to understand legal materials\u00ab.3Although the economic analysis of law provides several approaches and ways of research, in this article the main focus will be put to the efficiency and the increase of it as the main goal of commercial transactions and the proposal of the CESL as well. Additionally, it should be stated that the particular method of analyzing the legal rules from an economic perspective, is used from a lawyer\u2019s, not economist\u2019s view point. It means that the analysis should not be considered as the only right approach and outcome.     Before going to the analysis of the topic, few remarks should be devoted to the main concept of the article \u2013 the concept of efficiency. \u00bbFor long time efficiency was defined simply as the ability to produce more at a lower cost.\u00ab4However, nowadays the concept of efficiency has developed, and become more complex, and more widely applicable.     Most commonly \u00bbefficiency\u00ab is associated to wealth maximization, stating that efficiency is then when \u00bba judgment, an action, or a law enhances (\u2026) wealth rather than utility\u00ab.5 That is the perspective of efficiency which will be used in this article. Regarding efficiency, last but not least it should be mentioned that:     \u00bbIt is widely taken for granted that an efficient approach is ipso facto superior to an inefficient one. The fastest way to eliminate a rival policy from the field is simply to brand it inefficient.\u00ab6     However, the author believes that it is possible to test efficiency of a legal act only then, when it has come into force and is practically applied. Therefore, as the CESL is just a proposal, there can only be academic attempts to analyze its efficiency, mainly by comparing the CESL with similar legal acts.     2. THE CESL AND B2B TRANSACTIONS PURSUANT TO THE CESL     The CESL has been designed to be the applicable substantive law that can be chosen, when parties express their choice of law. It has been proposed by the EU Commission with a clear aim to \u00bbboost trade and expand consumer choice\u00ab7. The EU Commission has indicated that: \u00bbThe optional Common European Sales Law will help kick-start the Single Market, Europe\u2019s engine for economic growth. It will provide firms with an easy and cheap way to expand their business to new markets in Europe while giving consumers better deals and a high level of protection.\u00ab8 It allows concluding that the promotion of efficiency in cross-border commercial transactions is the central aim of the CESL.     The CESL is an optional regime, into which parties have to expressly opt-in.9 Such approach is contrary to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (the CISG), which is directly applicable, if one of the parties has its habitual residence in a country which is a member state of the CISG or if conflict of law rules lead to the application of CISG member state\u2019s law rules, unless the parties have expressly opted-out of it.10 One of the reasons of this difference is that from the very beginning the CESL has been designed as an optional legal instrument. Theoretically, it could have been proposed as the EU regulation with a direct effect11. However, taking into consideration the content of the proposal, i.e., the fact that it contains substantive sales law, it can be admitted that most likely the EU member states would not have agreed to the complete unification of the sales law in such way. This sphere still is in a process of harmonization.     There are several arguments, why the CESL might seem to be a good choice of the applicable law in the B2B transactions. First of all, the CESL is equally accessible and understandable to both parties. It does not give any direct advantages to any of the parties. Also it contains legal rules that have been carefully selected and drafted, taking into consideration the latest researches and well established practices. However, that what is not so clear is the relationship between the CESL and CISG. Almost all EU member states (except Portugal, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Malta) are member states of the CISG. Therefore, the CISG could also be equally well applicable to cross-border transactions in the EU. Moreover, as most of the legal rules of the CISG and the CESL, regulating the B2B transactions, are rather similar, it is not so clear, why two almost identical regulations are needed.     At the same time there are several arguments against the application of the CESL to B2B transactions. That what might prevent traders from choosing the CESL, is the non-existing practice. Indeed, it might take years until the first judgments related to the CESL will be available. And then another significant time period will be needed for establishing a permanent and unified interpretation of some of the issues, included in the CESL.     To sum up, it can be said that certainly the existence of the CESL and ability to choose it as the applicable law for B2B transactions might facilitate cross-border sales transactions. However, currently the CESL has been analyzed only in an academic level. Therefore, its practical use remains unclear and uncertain.     Before going into the analysis of the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller, it is necessary to determine the characteristics of a B2B transaction, inter alia, stating who can be the parties in such transaction. As it has been previously mentioned, B2B means \u00bbbusiness to business\u00ab. So B2B transactions in other words can be called commercial transactions, in which the parties are commercial entities, and none of the parties is a consumer. However, it should be clarified that the term \u00bbcommercial entity\u00ab does not necessarily in all cases mean a legal entity. In certain situations also private individuals can be treated as commercial entities.     The article 7(1) of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Common European Sales Law states that the CESL can be applied only if the seller is a trader. If both parties are traders, then the CESL may be used if \u00bbat least one of those parties is a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME)\u00ab. Pursuant to the article 7(2) of the CESL an SME is a trader which employs less than 250 employees, and has an annual turnover which does not exceed 50 million euros, or an annual balance sheet which does not exceed 43 million euros. The reason for such regulation is that \u00bbSME protection belongs to the widely recognized policies of the Union in the context of the international trade\u00ab.12 This is a very important aspect that has to been taken into consideration, when analyzing the relevant legal norms of the CESL. Namely, the intention to protect SMEs can be indirectly noticed in several legal norms of the CESL.     All B2B transactions (and thus also the legal relationships) are based on a contract. Indeed, the CESL cannot be applied if there is no contractual relationship related to the sale of goods that should be regulated. Assuming that the CESL is the applicable law for the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller, it is clear that the CESL has to contain rules that can be enforced. Moreover, the CESL has to contain rules, which does not directly benefit either of the parties. It has been stated that: \u00bbIn the language of law, a contract is fair when the value of the promise is proportional to the value of the consideration.\u00ab13     There are four basic values of a legal order: 1) certainty, 2) consistency, 3) stability, and 4) predictability.14 When analyzing the relevant rules of the CESL and the legal relationship between buyers and sellers, these values should be taken into consideration and used as one of the criteria for assessing the efficiency of legal norms.     3. AN INSIGHT IN THE LEGAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A BUYER AND A SELLER PURSUANT TO THE CESL     The term \u00bblegal relationship\u00ab within the framework of this article means the mutual balance and interaction of the rights and duties of a buyer and a seller. As the market of international sale of goods is not perfect, for example, there exists informational asymmetry15, also buyers and sellers are not in an equal position in their sales transaction. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze how the particular legal rules affect the existing imbalance of the parties and whether they help to decrease this imbalance, or, the other way round, increase it even more.     The legal relationship of a buyer and a seller in a sales contract can be analyzed from many perspectives. In this article the author has chosen to look at few basic issues: 1) contract formation; 2) burden of proof; 3) duty to inspect the goods; 4) remedies. By analyzing the previously mentioned legal aspects, it is possible to get an overall insight in the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller pursuant to the CESL.     In order to have a more detailed analysis, additionally to the economic perspective (transaction costs, allocation of risks and legal certainty), the CESL regulation of the above mentioned legal tools, inter alia, will be compared also to the CISG and national laws of the EU member states.     3.1. Contract formation     The basis of the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller is the sales contract, concluded between them. Therefore, the first logical step is the analysis of the relevant contract formation rules.     Pursuant to article 6 of the CESL a sales contract may be concluded by all means, and it does not require any particular form, unless stated differently in the CESL. It means that the contract does not have to be written; it can also be concluded orally (for example, via Skype) or even by direct actions of the parties (for example, the seller sends goods and invoice, and the buyer accepts the goods and pays the invoice).     In the legal theory it has been admitted that: \u00bbFreedom from formal requirements is also important in international sale of goods transactions.\u00ab16 There is no doubt that each additional action or duty that the parties have to carry out, increases the transaction costs and, thus, may also decrease the overall efficiency of the transaction. Drafting a contract is related to additional legal and administrative costs, which can be saved if the contract does not necessarily have to be in a written form. Moreover, the lack of mandatory requirement of a written contract also saves time. Nowadays, international sales transactions happen very fast. If the parties were obliged to conclude a written agreement for each of their transaction and for each needed amendment, the efficiency of their transaction would certainly decrease. Drafting an agreement, agreeing upon its terms and their formulations and at the end collecting the signatures take time.     If from the perspective of transaction costs it can be concluded that the article 6 of the CESL is efficient, then a slightly different conclusion might be, if the same legal norm is analyzed from the perspective of allocation of risks. There is no doubt that a written contract gives additional safety, because it is a direct and almost undisputable proof of the agreed terms of the particular legal relationship. Therefore, the situation that there is no written evidence of the contractual relationship might increase the risks; change the allocation of them, thus affecting the transaction as such.     Usually it is assumed that parties of a commercial transaction are risk-neutral, i.e., they do not see any risk affected difference between their choices and possible outcomes.17 The same can be said about the sales transaction pursuant to the CESL. Parties \u2013 traders \u2013 are neither risk seeking, nor risk-averse.     If a sales contract is not in a written form, the main risk is that one of the parties might fail to fulfill any of its obligations or might even deny existence of such contract. However, at the moment of concluding the contract, such risk is equally allocated \u2013 there is a risk that both parties might fail to perform their duties.     Although the CESL contains a flexible regulation regarding the contract formation, it should be born in mind that several issues still require a written form. For example, if the parties wish to solve their disputes in a court of arbitration, then most of jurisdictions require that the arbitration clause has been written and signed.18     Article 6 of the CESL complies with the article 11 of the CISG. The latter is a predecessor of the relevant regulation of the CESL.19 This factor can be used as evidence that the article 6 of the CESL can be considered as efficient, because it contains already widely accepted and used regulation.     The relevant regulation regarding the contract formation can be admitted as efficient. It provides flexibility and ability to react fast if there is such need.     3.2. Burden of proof     In total the CESL contains four articles, where the burden of proof has been mentioned.20 However, after having looked at their content, it can be concluded that they regulate the burden of proof issues only in B2C transactions. Thus, it is unclear who bears the burden of proof in B2B transactions. As the same is with the CISG regulation, i.e., the CISG does not really regulate the burden of proof issues either, the conclusions of scholars related to the CISG can be transplanted to the analysis of the CESL. The opinions are not unambiguous: some authors think that, as CISG does not govern it, domestic law should be applied. Others at the same time indicate that the problem could be solved by applying lex fori, taking into consideration that the burden of proof is a question of procedural law.21     Indeed, as the burden of proof is a question of procedural law, then the particular laws of the jurisdiction, in which the CESL is applied, most likely will be used. Although at the first moment it might seem to be uncertain, because most likely parties are not aware of each other\u2019s national procedural law rules, they can agree upon the jurisdiction, when concluding the sales contract, thus indirectly choosing the applicable procedural law rules. Moreover, parties may also agree to solve disputes in a court of arbitration and let the burden of proof be regulated by the relevant arbitration rules.     As well as pursuant to the CISG, also in the CESL the principle of ei incumbit probatio, qui dicit, non qui negat can be found.22 It means that the party, which claims something, has to prove it. This approach to the allocation of the burden of proof allows concluding that the transaction at the moment of proving becomes less efficient to the party that has to prove something. However, if at the end the expected result is achieved, then again the balance between the parties changes.     Burden of proof is directly connected to transaction costs: the party, who has to prove something, has to provide the evidence, and ensuring evidence costs either time, or other resources. However, there is a possibility that pursuant to national laws the party who wins the case may ask for remuneration of the litigation costs, which, inter alia, may include certain costs, related to gathering the evidence.23     At the same time there is also risk that it will turn out to be impossible to prove something. For example, if a contract is concluded orally without witnesses, then it might be rather impossible to prove certain contractual terms, e.g. agreed date of delivery. Therefore, when concluding the contract and when performing it, parties all the time have to make sure that they will be able to prove their actions later. On the one hand such situation may decrease the legal certainty of the transaction, but on the other hand it requires professional attitude towards the transaction. Moreover, additional and higher responsibility is to be required from the buyers and sellers in the B2B transactions, because they are commercial entities and can be considered as informed (or more informed) market players. It means that they have to pay attention to every detail that may affect the outcome of the transaction, including the possible risks regarding the burden of proof. Moreover, they can be required to predict the possible risks and, therefore, by mutually negotiating contractual terms, allocate them in the most efficient way. After having looked at some duties of the parties, it can be concluded that the buyer bears higher burden of proof. Particularly such assumption is based on the analysis of the relevant rules, regulating the buyer\u2019s duty to inspect the goods which is the subject of the analysis in the next chapter.     3.3. Time period of the duty to inspect the goods     The author would like to argue that the duty to inspect the goods is the core issue of the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller, which directly indicates the CESL\u2019s intention to protect the seller more than the buyer. Duty to inspect the goods by itself is important issue, which very often is the reason for disputes and litigations. As more than 50 percent of all cases, where the CISG has been applied, have dealt with quality standards of goods and the duty to inspect them,24 it can be assumed that, when the CESL comes into force and is practically applied, the situation might be similar as it is currently with the CISG.25     The importance of the duty to inspect the goods is there that the CESL by coming into the force will introduce a completely new and so far unknown regulation regarding the time limit, within which the buyer will have to inspect the goods. Therefore, it is worth looking more in details at this part of the legal relationship of a buyer and a seller.     The buyer\u2019s duty to inspect the goods is regulated by articles 121 and 122 of the CESL. Especially important is the first paragraph of the article 121, which states that: \u00bbIn a contract between traders the buyer is expected to examine the goods, or cause them to be examined, within as short a period as is reasonable not exceeding 14 days from the delivery of the goods (\u2026).\u00ab Such regulation is contrary to the article 38(1) of the CISG, which states that: \u00bbThe buyer must examine the goods, or cause them to be examined, within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances.\u00ab As it can be seen, the difference of time limits is obvious: on the one hand there is exact, precise time limit, expressed in days; on the other hand there is a flexible legal term that has to be interpreted in each and every case individually. Taking into consideration this difference, I will analyse the possible impact on efficiency that might be created by the article of the 121(1) CESL.     Inspection of goods is always directly related to transaction costs. As the buyer has to provide the inspection procedure, he bears higher transaction costs than the seller does. Moreover, as the inspection procedure is a practical process, the costs, related to the inspection procedure, directly depend on the needed and used resources.     There is no doubt that there are a lot of different goods, which are daily sold all over the world. Some goods (for example, simple furniture or gardening equipment) can be inspected very fast and the inspection procedure does not require a lot of resources. However, at the same time there are more complex goods (for example, chemical substances or advanced technologies), which require a proper inspection procedure, which is more costly and time consuming. Therefore, it can be assumed that not all goods can be inspected in an equal time period.     Article 121(1) of the CESL draws a strict borderline (deadline) \u2013 14 days \u2013 that cannot be exceeded. If a buyer fails to inspect the goods within two weeks, he loses the rights to indicate to possible defects.26 This regulation leads to situations that buyers will have to use additional resources in order to manage to properly inspect the goods. Thus, the transaction costs of buyers will increase. In the author\u2019s opinion due to such a strict regulation parties might want to draft their contracts more thoroughly, by clearly stating all possible issues and risks, related to the examination procedure and agreeing upon each party\u2019s responsibility and liability. Nevertheless, still it can be admitted that even the most precise contractual terms could hardly equalize the imbalance, created by the article 121(1) CESL.     Next issue, that has to be looked at, is risks. If a buyer has to inspect the goods within 14 days, he bears a risk that he might leave some defects unnoticed. Moreover, if such defective goods are later sold to consumers, even more negative consequences may appear.     The CESL does not provide buyers with a possibility to extend the term, given for the inspection procedure. Therefore, no matter what type the goods are or what the quantity of the is, the buyer has to carry out the inspection procedure \u00bbwithin as short a period as is reasonable not exceeding 14 days from the delivery of the goods\u00ab.     The basis of the article 121(1) of the CESL can be found at the beginning of the last decade, when the \u00bbCommunication from the European Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on European Contract Law\u00ab was published.27 However, only on January 7th, 2010, the European Commission published the Green Paper on Policy Options for Progress Towards a European Contract Law for Consumers and Businesses28.     The Green Paper indicates several aims of the CESL: first, the need for the legal certainty; second, elimination of the obstacles, which prevent an efficient use of the Single market; and last but not least, the unification of sales law in the European Union. Article 121(1) of the CESL resembles all of these aims.     Indeed, the article 121(1) gives legal certainty and, thus, facilitates the use of the Single market. Also it offers one unified regulation. Therefore, traders do not have to negotiate upon applicable substantive law. From the perspective of legal certainty it can be admitted that the article 121(1) of the CESL is more certain than the article 38(1) of the CISG. However, at the same time it is not completely certain. If the particular legal norm is carefully and literally analyzed, then it turns out that it is not clear if the 14 days long time period applies to all cases and buyers can always rely on those two weeks. In other words, is there still a requirement for inspection within as a short period as it is reasonable? The author believes that this question will be answered only when the first judgments, related to this issue, appear.     When talking about the time limit for the inspection procedure and how the courts deal with application of the article 38(1) CISG, the author would like to mention the Court of Salzburg decision in the Hydraulic Crane Case29, where the court stated that: \u00bbThe length of the short period for examination pursuant to the article 38(1) CISG is to be determined considering the size of the buyer\u2019s company, the type of goods, their complexity or deleteriousness or their character as seasonal goods, the amount of goods sold, the effort required for examination, and so forth.\u00ab This clearly shows the main characteristic of the article 38(1) CISG, i.e. its flexibility. When applying the article 121(1) CESL courts will not be able to referrer to factual circumstances; they will have to strictly follow the precise term, stated in the article 121(1) CESL.     Another issue, which can be related to the legal certainty, is that the CESL regulation, regarding the buyer\u2019s duty to inspect the goods, is contrary not only to the CISG, but also to the many national regulations of the EU member states. It can be seen in the following table.30     As it can be clearly seen, none of the EU member states, which relevant regulation has been looked at, contains precise (expressed in days) time period for the inspection period. There author believes that there might be several reasons for that. One of them could be direct transplantation of the relevant regulation from the CISG. For example in the Commercial Code of Latvia the regulation of commercial purchase transactions was introduced only at the beginning of 2010. As in that time Latvia had already joined the CISG, it is understandable that the national regulation was made similar to the CISG, in order to follow the demands of legal certainty and aims to harmonize sales law.     The fixed time period puts the buyer under additional pressure, which negatively impacts the transaction as such, and decreases its overall efficiency. The previously mentioned proves that, at least regarding the buyer\u2019s duty to inspect the goods, the CESL protects the seller more than the buyer.     It is clear that by introducing strict remedies the legislator has tried to motivate both parties to act with good faith and voluntarily ful?ll their contractual obligations. Such approach by itself can be justi?ed, because the less disputes there are, the more ef?cient is the overall turnover of the goods, and, thus, the whole market situation is improved as well.     3.4 Remedies     The CESL grants the parties wide range of remedies for the possible breach of a contract by the either party. Pursuant to the article 106 the buyer in general has the following remedies: 1) require of performance; 2) withhold the buyer\u2019s own performance; 3) terminate the contract; 4) reduce the price; 5) claim damages. However, pursuant to the article 106(2)(a) if the buyer is a trader his rights to exercise any remedy, except withholding of performance, are subject to cure by the seller.     At the same time pursuant to the article 131 of the CESL the seller has the following remedies: 1) require performance; 2) withhold the seller\u2019s own performance; 3) terminate the contract; 4) claim interest on the price or damages. Pursuant to the articles 106(6) and 131(4) remedies which are not incompatible may be cumulated.     Although the remedies are quite similar to both parties, there are some differences that change the balance between the parties. Namely, the article 106(2), which sets specific rules if the buyer is a trader (as it is in the B2B transactions), can be the reason for additional transaction costs for the buyer and disputes between the parties. For example, if the buyer wants to terminate the contract, he must inform the seller about that. Then pursuant to the article 116 of the CESL: \u00bbA buyer may terminate the contract before performance is due if the seller has declared, or it is otherwise clear, that there will be a non-performance, and if the nonperformance would be such as to justify termination.\u00ab However, at the same time pursuant to the articles 134 and 135 the preconditions for a seller to terminate the contract are less strict.     The role and importance of remedies has been stated as follows: \u00bbThe economic function of contract remedies, then, is to alter the incentives facing the party who regrets entering into the contract, which will directly affect the probability of performance and indirectly affect the number and type of contracts people make, the level of detail with which they identify their mutual obligations, the allocation of risks between the parties, the amount they invest in anticipation of performance once a contract is made, the precautions they take against the possibility of breach, and the precautions they take against the possibility of a regret contingency.\u00ab31     \u00bbThe general aim of damages for breach of contract is to put the claimant into as good a position as if the contract had been performed.\u00ab32 Pursuant to the article 131(1)(d) the seller is entitled to claim interest on the price or damages. However, the amount of possible interest has not been stated or limited. Moreover, \u00bbthe seller may claim interest for the full range of the prescription period even where the buyer\u2019s non-performance is permanently excused.\u00ab33 This legal norm leads to assumption that such remedy does not comply with the economic function of remedies. In the author\u2019s opinion remedies certainly help to equalize the relationship between contractual parties in case of a possible breach of contract. However, they should not put one party into a better position than it would be, if the contract were properly performed.     It is clear that by introducing strict remedies the legislator has tried to motivate both parties to act with good faith and voluntarily fulfill their contractual obligations. Such approach by itself can be justified, because the less disputes there are, the more efficient is the overall turnover of the goods, and, thus, the whole market situation is improved as well.     As it turns out that the buyer has to fulfill additional requirements, in order to be able to use the remedies, again it can be concluded that the transaction costs of the buyer will be higher. Thus, it is proved that the CESL, regarding available remedies and the use of them, is more favorable to the seller, than to the buyer.     By researching buyer\u2019s remedies, scholars have admitted that: \u00bbSpecifically as regards B2B sales contracts, the approach of foreseeing rules that apply without distinction to any type of trader is questionable, taking into account that the objective of foreseeing an additional protection specifically for SMEs and the effectiveness of these rules remain to be proven in practice to account their non-mandatory nature.\u00ab34     4. CONCLUSION     The CESL will provide traders with an optional regulation for cross-border sales transactions. It is meant to be a substantive law, directly applicable to the sales contracts, if the parties have expressly chosen it. The EU Commission has anticipated that the new regulation will increase trade within the EU and, thus, will help to develop the economies of the member states.     A brief analysis from the economic perspective of the relevant CESL legal norms, regulating the contract formation, burden of proof, time period for the duty to inspect the goods and remedies, allows having an insight into the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller under the CESL. It shows that the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller is in imbalance, i.e., due to several reasons, including market failure, parties cannot be considered as equal.     The freedom of the contract form can be admitted as efficient and promoting cross-border trade. Indeed, the lack of a mandatory requirement of a written form allows parties to be more flexible and does not unnecessarily increase their transaction costs. Although it raises additional risks, these risks are equally allocated between parties, and parties by themselves can choose any appropriate means how to decrease those risks.     Issues, related to the burden of proof, are not directly regulated by the CESL. Therefore, in case on necessity, parties will be dependent on the relevant lex fori law rules, as the burden of proof is a question of procedural law. As there are more possible situations in which the buyer might have to prove something, it can be admitted that the buyer bears higher burden of proof.     The buyer\u2019s duty to inspect the goods is one of the core elements, which help to describe and analyze the legal relationship between a buyer and a seller. The relevant legal norms of the CESL clearly show that the regulation of the duty to inspect the goods, regarding the time limit for the inspection procedure, is intended to protect the seller more than the buyer.     The precise time limit, expressed in days, may be considered as increasing legal certainty, but at the same time it increases the risks and transaction costs of the buyer. Moreover, such regulation is contrary not only to the relevant regulation of the CISG, but also to many national regulations of the EU member states. That might be another reason why the parties would not be willing to choose the CESL as the applicable law to their contractual relationship.     The precise time limit, expressed in days, may be considered as increasing legal certainty, but at the same time it increases the risks and transaction costs of the buyer. Moreover, such regulation is contrary not only to the relevant regulation of the CISG, but also to many national regulations of the EU member states.     The analysis of the possible remedies of the parties show that, although the remedies are quite equal, the buyer has to deal with additional requirements, in order to be able to use the remedies. These additional requirements can also be admitted as ones who may increase the transaction costs of the buyer, thus increasing the already existing imbalance between a buyer and a seller.     The overall conclusion of this article is that the CESL in B2B transactions protects the sellers more. I believe that there might be at least three reasons for that: 1) as one of the parties of a B2B transaction must be a SME, then by creating a seller-favorable regulation the EU has tried to facilitate commercial activities (wish to sell and, thus, also produce, and actively take part in the market) particularly of SMEs; 2) it has been assumed that by supporting the sellers the amount of transactions will increase; 3) as the CESL also regulates B2C transactions, in which undoubtedly the buyer is the one who is protected more, the EU has tried to equalize the balance of the regulation.     1 R.

Service Buildings     The service buildings \u010caplja and Kavka are placed in parallel with the contour lines at the edge of the valley shoulder with the slope. This type of placement allows flexible use of the central valley area and leaves the views of the glacial valley as unobstructed as possible. The architectural design of service buildings is reserved, bipartite with discreet architectural floating roof, which follows the incline of the terrain. Design is based on repetitive contrasts between hard and soft, permanent and temporary, cold and warm and public and private.     02     Service Building \u010caplja     The building \u010caplja is the main service building with vital rooms for the requirements of the operation of the ski jumping section of the Nordic Centre Planica. The building consists of two floors, a partially underground base, wooden pavilion and single pitch roof. The base of the building is divided into two parts with the lower cable car station. The building south of the cable car is for all service areas, which ski jumpers need for quality training and recuperation. The building north of the cable car is for garaging snow cats and other technical machinery. Various service contents of the building are interconnected via the base with the multi-purpose plateau, which descends over the stands to the landing strip of the Bloudek Giant and the landing strip of children\u2019s ski jumps and together with the surrounding terrain towards the hills form the greater event arena. A wooden pavilion is set on a part of the plateau south of the chair-lift. In addition to the central multi-purpose area of the pavilion, which opens the view to the majestic surrounding natural backdrop, the building also hosts the administrative offices of the centre. A single pitch roof has been laid over the pavilion, the lower cable car station, the bottom station of the inclined lift and the event plateau, which with its floating shape stands for the design leitmotif for all service and Warm-up building of the ski jumping section of the Nordic Centre Planica. The architectural image of the building follows the programme structure. The lower, service part with its technically shaped expression flirts with metal and concrete elements of the cable car and ski jumping infrastructure nearby, whereas the wooden pavilion with the choice of larch fa\u00e7ade alludes to the architectural expression of the alpine architectural heritage.     Profile E-E     Situation     Base lower floor     Base upper floor     Ground floor     First floor     Profile B1-B1, south facade     Profile E-E     03     Service Building Kavka     The building Kavka is intended for use by maintenance personnel, competition organisers and sports teams during training. From the perspective of preserving the collective memory the new building was built on the foundations of the \u201cold Kavka\u201d, which in its new form represents the nucleus of the new construction. In concept the building, as well as other buildings at the valley shoulder with the slope, is built from a solid semi-buried base, on top of which a construction body is placed, covered with single pitch roof with a ridge along the slope. The lower part of the building is intended for simple access to service and technical areas and the upper two-floor part for the day centre for sport teams in the preparatory stage, as well as administration. \u201cThe Old Kavka\u201d in its new design is a lounge area with a fire place and rooms around it intended for preparation and consumption of food and daily rest of athletes during training season. The new, bright and airy rooms open to the outside plateau, which on the south side over the stands descends towards the landing strip of the Gori\u0161ek Brother Flying Hill The architectural expression of the building, the same as for the \u010caplja building, comes from the programme design of the building. The base of the building together with retaining walls comes together in an extended concrete element, which is on the upper side in the entire length concluded with a bench. The upper body of the building is designed more intimately in combination of wooden fa\u00e7ade coating and panoramic glazing. "

With this data processing document, we would like to inform you about     the scope of data processing, how long the data is stored, and to whom your data will be accessible;     what your rights and remedies are in regard to data processing.     Please read the notice carefully. In case you may have any questions, we would like you to ask you to consult with us before accepting the notice on info@develor.com.     We would like to inform you in advance that you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in case the data was obtained for the enforcement of our legitimate interest or for the purpose of marketing as described below.     BASIC INFORMATION     Who will process your personal data?     Your data will be process by Develor International Private Limited Company (DEVELOR International \u201cZ\u00e1rtk\u00f6r\u0171en M\u0171k\u00f6d\u0151\u201d R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g), as data controller.

Fundamental concepts of data protection     Further below, we will present the most important concepts we use during our data processing with the help of icons:     The purpose of data processing:     Every single personal data is processed for a specific purpose, and these purposes are not linked together (e.g. we will only send you newsletters, if you have separately given your consent to that). In case we wish to process your data provided to us at an earlier time, we will inform you about it in advance.     Legal bases for data processing:     Data processing can have different legal basis depending on the purpose of processing: it can happen during fulfilling legal obligations (e.g. invoicing), or in implementation of a contract concluded with you, or in case of pursuit of any legitimate interests (e.g. dispute settlement), or with your consent. How do they differ?     In case of \u201clegal obligations\u201d, data processing is compulsory for us irrespectively of your consent or objection.     In case of \u201cconcluding a contract \/ implementing a contract\u201d, it is not obligatory to provide the requested data, however, in the absence of it, the contract will not be concluded, and you cannot receive the desired services.     Regarding \u201clegitimate interests\u201d, when there is an existing business relationship, we can contact you with the purpose of establishing a future business relationship, and we can process your data for pursuing our legitimate interests in case of an existing relationship (e.g. outstanding invoices, enforcing legal claims, providing evidence regarding administrative\/legal proceedings). Moreover, security camera surveillance at training sites also has the same legal basis.     Regarding \u201cconsent\u201d, we do not need it separately for the above-mentioned cases, however, certain amenity services (e.g. signing up for newsletter) can only be supplied if, with full knowledge of this Notice, you consent to the processing of the required personal data in advance. If, however, you do not consent to it, you shall not suffer any detriment because of it.     Concept of personal data:     Every information that is relating to you as a natural person and based on which you can be directly or indirectly identified, is called personal data (e.g. data related to customer identification, invoicing, contact details, e-mail address or IP address as well).     In cooperation with our customers, we always process the following data related to a given service, which is provided in a contract, or through an (online) form, or requested through consultation:     representative, contact person of the company, or in case of an individual entrepreneur: name, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, other provided contact details, workplace\/job, signature, other information related to communication;     in case of an individual entrepreneur such data further includes: billing name and address, VAT number;     in case of a private person: name, billing name and address, e-mail, and other provided contact details, signature.     Duration of data processing:     Processing of personal data shall only be performed for as little time as is strictly essential for supplying the given service it is associated with. If this period is over, your digitally stored data will be permanently deleted, and the data stored in paper form will be destroyed.     We are obliged to keep records and documents needed for fulfilling our tax and accounting dependency for the period required by the legislation in force (in accordance with Section 169 subsection 2 of Sz\u00e1mviteli tv., the accounting documents shall be stored for 8 years, while the tax and VAT payment documents shall be stored until the expiration of the right to tax assessment limitation period).     In case of every data processing purpose mentioned below (based on legitimate interest and when circumstances indicate it), we are authorised to process personal data until the enforceability of our legal right ends (general rule of limitation applies after 5 years).     Data transfer:     In certain cases, your personal data may be transferred to so called data processors (in some cases to other data controllers). Usually such transfer is necessary for providing the rendered services, and for service development within the Develor Group (e.g. measuring client satisfaction).     Personal data is usually stored in digital form as well, which, if necessary, can be accessed by the data processors operating our case management and information technology systems:     Isolutions Informatikai Kft.

HIA call: Service providers (deadline on 5th of December) 09:09:2020     In scope of the HIA project, funded by the European Comission and coordinated by TECOS with the help of SRIP FoF and Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, we are launching the second call for expression of interest, where we invite interested companies with relevant Industry 4.0 references to apply. This is the second of the overall three open calls within this project.     The High-Impact Action (HIA) consists of the piloting of a \u201ctransformative mechanism\u201d. HIA has a focus on development of a physical and virtual platform for piloting and demonstrating modular and reconfigurable cells across various industries. When complete this platform will bring together equipment, resources, expertise, people from a broad range of organisations (research and technology organisations, centres of excellence, SMEs, corporates, etc.) specialising in industry 4.0 development and deployment.     After this call for service provider, the third HIA call, awarding vouchers to 5 companies, will be launched. The call-winning SMEs will be able to use the vouchers to pay for the services of projects service providers which will enable them to upgrade their production cells to be more efficient, reconfigurable, interconnected and modular. The purpose of this is to draw lessons from individual cases and extract specifications for a forementioned physical platform.     HIA call for Service Providers     Please read the call for additional information or contact us via simona.vernon@tecos.si or matic.erzen@ijs.si.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

      "text":" Environmental health     An article posted by Anne Godfrey, Chartered Institute of Environmental Health on 02 September 2016 \u2013 Follow the link     Environmental health has been defined in a 1999 document by the World Health Organization (WHO) as:     Those aspects of the human health and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially and affect health.     Hygiene of facilities and processes     Health risk factors have to be managed indoor and outdoor where people live, work and spend their free time. Among other qualifications sanitary engineer is also qualified for hygienic analysis and solving hygiene problems in different facilities and working processes. Especially in facilities that are important for maintaining health throughout the life cycle of man (Health facilities, kindergartens, schools, food industry, homes for the elderly, laundries, etc.). In this context, we pay the attention to the elements and methods of technical and hygienic management of buildings and processes in different environments and circumstances.     Risk assessment and risk management     Understanding the risks to human health is one of the most important challenges in the field of public health. That is why the risk assessment has been rapidly developing in the last 30 years. Risk assessment is a significant segment of identifying and studying risk to health and environment. It is extremely interdisciplinary work, involving different experts including chemists and biologists, doctors, statisticians, physicists, and sanitary engineers. Primarily, the approach of risk assessment, was developed for the evaluation of risks to human health due to exposure to chemicals. During the development, the use of the risk assessment was successfully extended to the segment of the environmental impact. In addition we can also assessed exposure to a physical or (micro) biological risk factors. If the risk assessment confirms that the risk exists, it is always followed by the next step, management, control and reduction of risk (Polj\u0161ak and Jereb, 2012).     Emergency situations     At the large-scale natural disasters (floods, devastating earthquake, storms, epidemics of infectious diseases and other cases), the affected community is faced with the so-called emergency situations. Emergency situations arise when there are (usually suddenly) the disproportions between the needs of the group of people and ability to manage that needs at the affected area (Macarol-Hiti, 2000). Organization of work in this circumstances is the most essential component of the protection and rescue. It ensures simultaneous and efficient work of various departments. Of course, in order to, as far as possible, minimize the consequences of each accident, and especially to prevent or minimize human casualties (Poor, 2006). From the sanitary point of view it is necessary in an emergency, especially when it is required the relocation of people from vulnerable places, to implement technical and hygiene measures such as:     Sodelovanje sanitarnih in\u017eenirjev na strate\u0161kem forumu mednarodne revije Environmental Health Perspectives https:\/\/t.co\/qnLSbth7k6 "

The old is no more, yet the new remains out of reach. On this threshold the ensemble Carmina Slovenica plays seemingly harmless games, recites texts by J. J.

The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Bank of Slovenia authorisations     Payment systems     In the area of payment systems, the Bank of Slovenia is responsible for issuing three types of authorisations: the authorisation for the establishement of a payment system, the authorisation for the amendment of a payment system and the authorisation for the operation of a payment system.     Authorisation for the establishement of a payment system     Under the Payment Services, Services of Issuing Electronic Money and Payment Systems Act (in Slovene), payment system participants establish a payment system by adopting the payment system rules and obtaining an authorisation from the Bank of Slovenia for the establishement of a payment system. The Bank of Slovenia issues the authorisation for the establishement of a payment system if the payment system meets the conditions set out by the Payment Services, Services of Issuing Electronic Money and Payment Systems Act and the Decision on payment systems (in Slovene). The Decision on the amounts of annual fees for supervision and fees for decisions regarding requests for the granting of Bank of Slovenia authorisations pursuant to the Payment Services, Services of Issuing Electronic Money and Payment Systems Act sets out the fees for deciding on requests for the granting of the authorisation in question.     Authorisation for the amendment of a payment system     In the event of an amendment in the rules of a payment system, in accordance with the Payment Services, Services of Issuing Electronic Money and Payment Systems Act participants are required to obtain an authorisation from the Bank of Slovenia for the amendment of a payment system, whereby the procedure applying to the granting of an authorisation for the establishement of a payment system applies mutatis mutandis to the Bank of Slovenia\u2019s decision to grant the authorisation for the amendment of a payment system. The fees for deciding on requests for the granting of the authorisation in question are set out by the Decision on the amounts of annual fees for supervision and fees for decisions regarding requests for the granting of Bank of Slovenia authorisations pursuant to the Payment Services, Services of Issuing Electronic Money and Payment Systems Act.

      "text":" Litter\u00e6 Slovenic\u00e6 is the international home to 156 authors, 164 translators and 72 books from Slovenia in 10 languages.     A worldwide presentation of Slovene literature, Slovene literary life and Slovene culture in general to readers abroad.     Perfect for book fairs, festivals, critics, publishers, agents, translators, foreign language programs, universities, libraries, cultural centers, embassies etc.     Latest news     We are happy to announce that the book series Litterae Slovenicae has a new book release. This time and for the first time in the history of Litterae Slovenicae the new title Aus der Rumpelkammer from Peter Svetina is dedicated for children from 9 to 14 years, with the wonderful colourfull illustrations by Damijan Stepan\u010di\u010d. [\u2026]     Sebastijan Pregelj: The Chronicle of Forgetting in English Translation has been included in the Longlist of Library Nominations for the DUBLIN Literary Award 2021 The English translation of the novel A Chronicle of Forgetting (Sebastijan Pregelj \u2013 Kronika pozabljanja, Goga, 2014), published by the book series Litterae Slovenicae by the Slovene Writers\u2019 Association, was [\u2026]     History     International Edition of Slovene Literature     In May of 1963, Slovene Writers\u2019 Association published the first issue of Le Livre Slov\u00e8ne. The publication was a response to the need of the Slovene Writers\u2019 Association, Slovene PEN Centre and the Slovenian Association of Literary Translators to independently present Slovene literature, Slovene literary life and Slovene culture in general to readers abroad.     In the course of 50 years, around 100 volumes and 130 issues have been published. At first, the publication mostly published texts in French, German and occasionally in English. In the 1970s, the first texts in Italian and Russian were published, followed by those in Spanish in the 1980s. In 1991, the publication was renamed Litter\u00e6 Slovenic\u00e6. Since then, the predominant language of publication has been English and German, accompanied by the previously mentioned languages and Portuguese. The series has traditionally given preference to publication of original literature of Slovene authors in translation, in particular of prose, poetry and essays.     50 Years, 130 Issues     An Integral part of Internationalization     In 2012 the publication was awarded with the \u00bbLavrinova diploma\u00ab prize for the best international project for promotion of Slovene literature in foreign countries.     Editorial Concept     Emminent Slovenian authors     The editorial concept of Litter\u00e6 Slovenic\u00e6 series is to publish representative works by eminent Slovenian authors in both foreign and bi- or multilingual editions. The editorial board strives to publish all literary genres in equal proportion (poetry, prose fiction, plays and essays) as well as to represent a range of male and female authors from different generations.     Because Litter\u00e6 Slovenic\u00e6 aims, on the one hand, to fill the gaps in the translation of classic Slovenian literature from our recent and more distant literary history, it partly focuses on the translation of previously untranslated standard works by Slovenian authors of the past (Marjan Ro\u017eanc, Josip Murn, Rudi \u0160eligo etc.). On the other hand, it aims to translate and promote contemporary literature by valued living Slovenian authors.     Classic & contemporary     Editorial selection     The editors, through their selection of works and aided by a team of co-workers (mainly translators), are responsible for capably presenting Slovenian authors in selected foreign languages. The books are primarily translated into larger languages in which Slovenian literature (at least when it comes to certain leading authors who are under-promoted abroad) is very often underrepresented and finds too little resonance.     Since 2010 Litter\u00e6 Slovenic\u00e6 has been successfully cooperating with the prominent American publishing house Dalkey Archive Press, which participates annually as a co-publisher of one of the books by the Slovenian \u201cauthor in focus\u201d at the Vilenica International Literary Festival.

      "text":" Mineral content     Mineral content     A water molecule contains only two elements: hydrogen and oxygen. Pure water is odourless and tasteless and cannot be found in a pure chemical state in nature. Water composition changes during its circulation in nature, as it dissolves rocks during its journey. That is why, in addition to the basic H2O molecule, it also contains minerals that it dissolved on its way. It is the mineral content that is highly variable among waters. Minerals significantly determine the taste of the water.     Minerals and health     Minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium are substances that our body needs in certain amounts, but cannot synthesise. They have to be fed into the body with food and drink, and natural mineral water can be a good source. However, not all minerals are equally beneficial to health. Some are preferred, e.g. calcium and magnesium, others less desirable, e.g. sodium. The composition of Dana is very beneficial for the human body, as it contains a relatively high amount of calcium (>60 mg\/l) and magnesium (>30 mg\/l) and has a low content of other less preferred minerals, such as sodium. In terms of mineral content in milligrams per litre of water (mg\/l), water is classified into:     highly mineralised water (more than 1000 mg\/l minerals),     medium mineralised water (500 to 1000 mg\/l),     low mineralised water (less than 500 mg\/l).     Dana ranks among the MEDIUM to LOW MINERALISED water, as it contains on average only 525 mg\/l of dissolved mineral substances. Among them, the predominant ones are essential minerals, namely calcium and magnesium, while the concentrations of less desired minerals are low (e.g. sodium, chlorine, nitrates and sulphates). Waters with medium and low mineralisation may have a slight diuretic effect and contribute to the removal of excess water from the body.     NATURAL MINERAL WATER     The designation of natural mineral water is not conditional on the quantity of the minerals it contains, but rather its purity, constant composition throughout the years, and recognition of the water source and quality by the competent ministry. Therefore, it represents a \u201ccommitment\u201d of sorts to the consumer, who can choose the best from a diverse range of products. Natural mineral water comes from its own source underground that is completely protected from any contamination. Such water is normally bottled at the source or transmitted to the bottling plant through short pipelines. It is collected practically at the site of origin. The composition of natural mineral water does not change or changes by no more than \u00b1 20% due to natural fluctuations. This suggests that the water resource is stable and not affected by environmental disturbances. This does not apply to all water sources \u2013 for example, water originating from surface water, whose consistency of composition may be questionable. The main ingredients of Dana water (Ca, Mg, hydrogencarbonates) are constant and stable over years of analyses or fluctuate within the permitted natural fluctuations. All this is marked on the packaging.     CALCIUM     Calcium is undoubtedly one of the most well-known minerals and the main building block of our skeleton. It plays an important role in maintaining bones. Our body contains as much as 1 kg of calcium! If we do not get enough calcium in our youth, the body draws from its own calcium deposits, which can be manifested in bone fragility and osteoporosis in older years. A litre of mineral water provides as much calcium as two glasses of milk. Dana natural mineral water contains a relatively large amount of calcium, more than 60 mg\/l.     MAGNESIUM     This could also be referred to as the mineral for relaxation. The cause of our malaise can sometimes be a lack of magnesium, a mineral that improves our physical ability, contributes to the transmission of nervous stimuli and the regulation of muscle contractions. It plays an important role in the functioning and relaxation of muscles, it has a beneficial effect on digestion, and supports the absorption of calcium in the body. Dana natural mineral water contains on average more than 30 mg\/l of magnesium.     HYDROGENCARBONATE     Hydrogencarbonate can be found in every natural mineral water. It neutralises excess acid in the body (e.g. in the stomach, blood and muscles) and thus helps control the acid-base balance. The intake of excessive amounts of food rich in protein and carbohydrates, as well as the modern lifestyle full of haste, stress and lack of physical activity, lead to the accumulation of too much acid in the body. Prolonged acidification of body tissues and liquids can be a cause of numerous chronic diseases. In order to maintain balance, it is important to eat basic foods such as fruit, vegetables, milk and herbs and to drink natural mineral waters, especially those with a hydrogencarbonate content. Dana natural mineral water contains on average more than 390 mg\/l of hydrogencarbonate.     SODIUM     Sodium belongs among the less desirable ingredients of mineral waters. Far more sodium than needed is introduced into the diet through cooking salt, which results in adverse effects on health. One of the basic steps in case of increased blood pressure is limiting salt and thus sodium in the diet. Attention should also be paid to basic food and water. Dana contains on average only 2.3 mg\/l if sodium. Due to the low sodium content, Dana was issued a decision by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food on the fulfilment of the conditions for the additional label \u201cWater suitable for a low-sodium diet\u201d. Usually, this is the diet in the case of high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases.     NITRATES     In nature, nitrates also result from human activity in nature, mainly the use of artificial and natural fertilisers. The proportion of nitrate intake through drinking water increases with the increase in nitrate concentration in drinking water. Drinking water with nitrate concentrations above 50 mg\/l represents a health problem for infants, pregnant women and nursing mothers. Dana has a low nitrate content \u2013 below 5 mg\/l, which is 10 times less than the permitted nitrate content in water.     Dana water is pH neutral     The pH value is a known acidity and alkalinity criterion ranging between 0 and 14. The pH values in the human body are precisely regulated. The pH of our skin is acidic and is about 5.5, while the pH of the blood is slightly alkaline, above 7. Natural mineral waters can have a pH value of 6.5 - 9.5 according to the regulations. Dana water has a highly favourable pH with an average value of between 7.30 - 7.40. This is a non-aggressive and practically neutral pH, which is highly beneficial for the body. The value is very similar to the pH of the blood (which is between 7.35 and 7.45).     Our website uses cookies to provide up-to-date user experience, promotion, and traffic statistics.

      "text":" Archival article     Niko Gor\u0161i\u010d, the founder of the Global Theatre, has been a member of Mladinsko Theatre since 1970, and has played significant roles in productions such as Missa in A-minor (1980), Alice in Wonderland (1986), Odysseus and his Son (1990) and Marat (2002). He has also been involved with other theatre houses, both in Slovenia and abroad (Beograd, Split, Subotica, Rijeka, Budva, Vienna and Pula). In 1999 he established Global Theatre to focus on a post-modern attitude and 'puzzle' technique in acting and directing, using the pseudonym Nick Upper. In 2001 Global Theatre produced the metaphysical Balkan Comedy Caesar (directed by Branko Brezovac) in collaboration with MKC, Macedonia and Tvornica, Croatia, which was presented at the Laokoon Festival, Kampnagel in Hamburg. In 2003 the drama text Jano\u010dek by Franjo Fran\u010di\u010d was staged at Glej Theatre. In 2004 Tin\u010dek Petelin\u010dek, a work using traditional Slovene lileki folk puppets, was presented in Brussels in a co-production with Mini Theatre. The performance Balkan Blues (Final Countdown), based on a text by Romanian Saviana Stanescu, was also presented in co-production with the Macedonian National Theatre Kumanovo and presented at the Ohrid Summer Festival in 2004.

      "text":" Login and Registration Issues     Why can\u2019t I login?     There are several reasons why this could occur. First, ensure your username and password are correct. If they are, contact the board owner to make sure you haven\u2019t been banned. It is also possible the website owner has a configuration error on their end, and they would need to fix it.     You may not have to, it is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order to post messages. However; registration will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such as definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing of fellow users, usergroup subscription, etc. It only takes a few moments to register so it is recommended you do so.     If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you login, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university computer lab, etc. If you do not see this checkbox, it means the board administrator has disabled this feature.     How do I prevent my username appearing in the online user listings?     Within your User Control Panel, under \u201cBoard preferences\u201d, you will find the option Hide your online status. Enable this option with Yes and you will only appear to the administrators, moderators and yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.     Don\u2019t panic! While your password cannot be retrieved, it can easily be reset. Visit the login page and click I\u2019ve forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be able to log in again shortly.     First, check your username and password. If they are correct, then one of two things may have happened. If COPPA support is enabled and you specified being under 13 years old during registration, you will have to follow the instructions you received. Some boards will also require new registrations to be activated, either by yourself or by an administrator before you can logon; this information was present during registration. If you were sent an e-mail, follow the instructions. If you did not receive an e-mail, you may have provided an incorrect e-mail address or the e-mail may have been picked up by a spam filer. If you are sure the e-mail address you provided is correct, try contacting an administrator.     I registered in the past but cannot login any more?!     Attempt to locate the e-mail sent to you when you first registered, check your username and password and try again. It is possible an administrator has deactivated or deleted your account for some reason. Also, many boards periodically remove users who have not posted for a long time to reduce the size of the database. If this has happened, try registering again and being more involved in discussions.     COPPA, or the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998, is a law in the United States requiring websites which can potentially collect information from minors under the age of 13 to have written parental consent or some other method of legal guardian acknowledgment, allowing the collection of personally identifiable information from a minor under the age of 13. If you are unsure if this applies to you as someone trying to register or to the website you are trying to register on, contact legal counsel for assistance. Please note that the phpBB Group cannot provide legal advice and is not a point of contact for legal concerns of any kind, except as outlined below.     It is possible the website owner has banned your IP address or disallowed the username you are attempting to register. The website owner could have also disabled registration to prevent new visitors from signing up. Contact a board administrator for assistance.     \u201cDelete all board cookies\u201d deletes the cookies created by phpBB which keep you authenticated and logged into the board. It also provides functions such as read tracking if they have been enabled by the board owner. If you are having login or logout problems, deleting board cookies may help.     User Preferences and settings     How do I change my settings?     If you are a registered user, all your settings are stored in the board database. To alter them, visit your User Control Panel; a link can usually be found at the top of board pages. This system will allow you to change all your settings and preferences.     It is possible the time displayed is from a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, visit your User Control Panel and change your timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. If you are not registered, this is a good time to do so.     I changed the timezone and the time is still wrong!     If you are sure you have set the timezone and Summer Time\/DST correctly and the time is still incorrect, then the time stored on the server clock is incorrect. Please notify an administrator to correct the problem.     Either the administrator has not installed your language or nobody has translated this board into your language. Try asking the board administrator if they can install the language pack you need. If the language pack does not exist, feel free to create a new translation. More information can be found at the phpBB website (see link at the bottom of board pages).     There are two images which may appear along with a username when viewing posts. One of them may be an image associated with your rank, generally in the form of stars, blocks or dots, indicating how many posts you have made or your status on the board. Another, usually a larger image, is known as an avatar and is generally unique or personal to each user. It is up to the board administrator to enable avatars and to choose the way in which avatars can be made available. If you are unable to use avatars, contact a board administrator and ask them for their reasons.     Ranks, which appear below your username, indicate the number of posts you have made or identify certain users, e.g. moderators and administrators. In general, you cannot directly change the wording of any board ranks as they are set by the board administrator. Please do not abuse the board by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank. Most boards will not tolerate this and the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post count.     When I click the e-mail link for a user it asks me to login?     Only registered users can send e-mail to other users via the built-in e-mail form, and only if the administrator has enabled this feature. This is to prevent malicious use of the e-mail system by anonymous users.     Posting Issues     How do I post a topic in a forum?     To post a new topic in a forum, click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. A list of your permissions in each forum is available at the bottom of the forum and topic screens. Example: You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc.     Unless you are a board administrator or moderator, you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post by clicking the edit button for the relevant post, sometimes for only a limited time after the post was made. If someone has already replied to the post, you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic which lists the number of times you edited it along with the date and time. This will only appear if someone has made a reply; it will not appear if a moderator or administrator edited the post, though they may leave a note as to why they\u2019ve edited the post at their own discretion. Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.     To add a signature to a post you must first create one via your User Control Panel. Once created, you can check the Attach a signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio button in your profile. If you do so, you can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box within the posting form.     When posting a new topic or editing the first post of a topic, click the \u201cPoll creation\u201d tab below the main posting form; if you cannot see this, you do not have appropriate permissions to create polls. Enter a title and at least two options in the appropriate fields, making sure each option is on a separate line in the textarea. You can also set the number of options users may select during voting under \u201cOptions per user\u201d, a time limit in days for the poll (0 for infinite duration) and lastly the option to allow users to amend their votes.     The limit for poll options is set by the board administrator. If you feel you need to add more options to your poll than the allowed amount, contact the board administrator.     As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator or an administrator. To edit a poll, click to edit the first post in the topic; this always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote, users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if members have already placed votes, only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it. This prevents the poll\u2019s options from being changed mid-way through a poll.     Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post or perform another action you may need special permissions. Contact a moderator or board administrator to grant you access.     Attachment permissions are granted on a per forum, per group, or per user basis. The board administrator may not have allowed attachments to be added for the specific forum you are posting in, or perhaps only certain groups can post attachments. Contact the board administrator if you are unsure about why you are unable to add attachments.     Each board administrator has their own set of rules for their site. If you have broken a rule, you may be issued a warning. Please note that this is the board administrator\u2019s decision, and the phpBB Group has nothing to do with the warnings on the given site. Contact the board administrator if you are unsure about why you were issued a warning.     If the board administrator has allowed it, you should see a button for reporting posts next to the post you wish to report. Clicking this will walk you through the steps necessary to report the post.     This allows you to save passages to be completed and submitted at a later date. To reload a saved passage, visit the User Control Panel.     The board administrator may have decided that posts in the forum you are posting to require review before submission. It is also possible that the administrator has placed you in a group of users whose posts require review before submission. Please contact the board administrator for further details.     By clicking the \u201cBump topic\u201d link when you are viewing it, you can \u201cbump\u201d the topic to the top of the forum on the first page. However, if you do not see this, then topic bumping may be disabled or the time allowance between bumps has not yet been reached. It is also possible to bump the topic simply by replying to it, however, be sure to follow the board rules when doing so.     Formatting and Topic Types     What is BBCode?     BBCode is a special implementation of HTML, offering great formatting control on particular objects in a post. The use of BBCode is granted by the administrator, but it can also be disabled on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML, but tags are enclosed in square brackets [ and ] rather than < and >. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.     No. It is not possible to post HTML on this board and have it rendered as HTML. Most formatting which can be carried out using HTML can be applied using BBCode instead.     Smilies, or Emoticons, are small images which can be used to express a feeling using a short code, e.g. :) denotes happy, while :( denotes sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen in the posting form. Try not to overuse smilies, however, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may edit them out or remove the post altogether. The board administrator may also have set a limit to the number of smilies you may use within a post.     Yes, images can be shown in your posts. If the administrator has allowed attachments, you may be able to upload the image to the board. Otherwise, you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http:\/\/www.example.com\/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor images stored behind authentication mechanisms, e.g. hotmail or yahoo mailboxes, password protected sites, etc. To display the image use the BBCode [img] tag.     Global announcements contain important information and you should read them whenever possible. They will appear at the top of every forum and within your User Control Panel. Global announcement permissions are granted by the board administrator.     Announcements often contain important information for the forum you are currently reading and you should read them whenever possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. As with global announcements, announcement permissions are granted by the board administrator.     Sticky topics within the forum appear below announcements and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them whenever possible. As with announcements and global announcements, sticky topic permissions are granted by the board administrator.     Locked topics are topics where users can no longer reply and any poll it contained was automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons and were set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You may also be able to lock your own topics depending on the permissions you are granted by the board administrator.     Topic icons are author chosen images associated with posts to indicate their content. The ability to use topic icons depends on the permissions set by the board administrator.     User Levels and Groups     What are Administrators?     Administrators are members assigned with the highest level of control over the entire board. These members can control all facets of board operation, including setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc., dependent upon the board founder and what permissions he or she has given the other administrators. They may also have full moderator capabilities in all forums, depending on the settings put forth by the board founder.     Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) who look after the forums from day to day. They have the authority to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally, moderators are present to prevent users from going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.     Usergroups are groups of users that divide the community into manageable sections board administrators can work with. Each user can belong to several groups and each group can be assigned individual permissions. This provides an easy way for administrators to change permissions for many users at once, such as changing moderator permissions or granting users access to a private forum.     You can view all usergroups via the \u201cUsergroups\u201d link within your User Control Panel. If you would like to join one, proceed by clicking the appropriate button. Not all groups have open access, however. Some may require approval to join, some may be closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the group is open, you can join it by clicking the appropriate button. If a group requires approval to join you may request to join by clicking the appropriate button. The user group leader will need to approve your request and may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not harass a group leader if they reject your request; they will have their reasons.     A usergroup leader is usually assigned when usergroups are initially created by a board administrator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup, your first point of contact should be an administrator; try sending a private message.     Why do some usergroups appear in a different colour?     It is possible for the board administrator to assign a colour to the members of a usergroup to make it easy to identify the members of this group.     If you are a member of more than one usergroup, your default is used to determine which group colour and group rank should be shown for you by default. The board administrator may grant you permission to change your default usergroup via your User Control Panel.     This page provides you with a list of board staff, including board administrators and moderators and other details such as the forums they moderate.     Private Messaging     I cannot send private messages!     There are three reasons for this; you are not registered and\/or not logged on, the board administrator has disabled private messaging for the entire board, or the board administrator has prevented you from sending messages. Contact a board administrator for more information.     You can block a user from sending you private messages by using message rules within your User Control Panel. If you are receiving abusive private messages from a particular user, inform a board administrator; they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages.     I have received a spamming or abusive e-mail from someone on this board!     We are sorry to hear that. The e-mail form feature of this board includes safeguards to try and track users who send such posts, so e-mail the board administrator with a full copy of the e-mail you received. It is very important that this includes the headers that contain the details of the user that sent the e-mail. The board administrator can then take action.     Friends and Foes     What are my Friends and Foes lists?     You can use these lists to organise other members of the board. Members added to your friends list will be listed within your User Control Panel for quick access to see their online status and to send them private messages. Subject to template support, posts from these users may also be highlighted. If you add a user to your foes list, any posts they make will be hidden by default.     How can I add \/ remove users to my Friends or Foes list?     You can add users to your list in two ways. Within each user\u2019s profile, there is a link to add them to either your Friend or Foe list. Alternatively, from your User Control Panel, you can directly add users by entering their member name. You may also remove users from your list using the same page.     Searching the Forums     How can I search a forum or forums?     Enter a search term in the search box located on the index, forum or topic pages. Advanced search can be accessed by clicking the \u201cAdvance Search\u201d link which is available on all pages on the forum. How to access the search may depend on the style used.     Your search was probably too vague and included many common terms which are not indexed by phpBB3. Be more specific and use the options available within Advanced search.     Your search returned too many results for the webserver to handle. Use \u201cAdvanced search\u201d and be more specific in the terms used and forums that are to be searched.     Your own posts can be retrieved either by clicking the \u201cSearch user\u2019s posts\u201d within the User Control Panel or via your own profile page. To search for your topics, use the Advanced search page and fill in the various options appropriately.     Topic Subscriptions and Bookmarks     What is the difference between bookmarking and subscribing?     Bookmarking in phpBB3 is much like bookmarking in your web browser. You aren\u2019t alerted when there\u2019s an update, but you can come back to the topic later. Subscribing, however, will notify you when there is an update to the topic or forum on the board via your preferred method or methods.     To subscribe to a specific forum, click the \u201cSubscribe forum\u201d link upon entering the forum. To subscribe to a topic, reply to the topic with the subscribe checkbox checked or click the \u201cSubscribe topic\u201d link within the topic itself.     To remove your subscriptions, go to your User Control Panel and follow the links to your subscriptions.     Attachments     What attachments are allowed on this board?     Each board administrator can allow or disallow certain attachment types. If you are unsure what is allowed to be uploaded, contact the board administrator for assistance.     To find your list of attachments that you have uploaded, go to your User Control Panel and follow the links to the attachments section.     phpBB 3 Issues     Who wrote this bulletin board?

And Beyond. \u2013 a new project by Davorin Marc is one of the numerous experiments with short-film format, characteristic for this filmmaker and artist all through his career since 1970s. He frequently cuts into the materiality of film reel and surprises with creative editing, producing a dynamic interplay of image and sound.     The selected nine films from the first period (1976\u20131987) were pulled Out of the Closet and will be shown on TV set. The eight films from the second period (after 2012) will be projected on the wall And Beyond.     The public will be led to the Project Room SCCA passing A Little Here. \u2013 a magic animation in the drawer \u2013 and guided to the window installation And a Little There. \u2013 where the light of the day and night meet.     Davorin Marc, Last few frames, 2013\/2014     Davorin Marc was born Izola in 1964. He has devoted his life to art, especially film, in his very early years. His first film dates in 1976 and until today he has made more than 150 short films, witty diaries and documents of times and situations. He was also active in comics, collages, fanzines and produced a number of installations and exhibitions in the 1980s. He dared to negate the main principles of film directing and editing, introducing a film as an interactive happening. After a long break in his career he is now back on track with a great courage, focusing on digital film and producing \u201cdigital pictures\u201d. Some of his films have been preserved\/restored by the Slovenian Cinematheque, Ljubljana and widely shown on several festivals, exhibitions and personal screenings, e. g. Alternative Film\/Video festival, Belgrade; Kino otok (Isolacinema), Izola; All That is Film!, Experimental Film in Yugoslavia 1951-1991 in Moderna galerija Ljubljana; Anthology Film Archives in New York; Cinematheque Quebecoise, Montreal; Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley; Northwest Film Forum, Seattle; K3 Film Festival Udine | FRAME, Cinema Centrale Udine; Eks Voto (a tama for Ektachrome), The island of Tinos, Greece; International Experimental Film & Video Festival VIDEOEX 2013, Zurich. On the occasion of screening program at the University of Rochester, his masterpieces were shown (e.g. Bite Me. Once Already \/ Ugrizni me. \u017de Enkrat (1978\/80), Slaughter Ahoy \/ Ej Klanje (1981), Fear in the City (1181 Days Later or Smell of Rats) \/ Paura in Citta (1181 Dni Pozneje Ali Vonj Po Podganah) (1984)) and introduced by Jurij Meden, Curator of Film Exhibitions at the George Eastman House: The post-punk Davorin Marc remains very much a subject for further research. Notoriously reclusive and with over 150 Super-8mm and 16mm films under his belt, he modestly describes his work as \u201csmall films,\u201d period, pushing the notion of understatement to a radical, bleeding new extreme.

Letos nas vreme ni pustilo na cedilu in na vro\u010dem soncu je \u0161vicalo 25 gasilcev in gasilk in seveda \u0161e nekaj sodnikov ter gledalcev. Po lanskem letu, pa so na\u0161i operativci ponovno posegli po najvi\u0161jih mestih.

      "text":" 200 years     National Museum of Slovenia     The National Museum of Slovenia is the oldest museum institution in Slovenia. Its mission is to protect, evaluate, research, interpret, exhibit and present the national cultural heritage, and to interact with the public. The idea of founding a national museum goes way back in the past, with the first steps taken by baron Sigismund Zois von Edelstein and the key figures of the enlightenment movement. The beginning of the French administration and foundation of the Illyrian Provinces had somewhat postponed the far-reaching intention. The direct initiative, however, was given in 1821 by the participants of the famous Congress of Ljubljana, who pointed out that Carniola had no museum of its own. They had passed the proposal on to the provincial estates (Landst\u00e4nde), who made a decision on 15 October 1821 to establish a provincial museum. They issued an announcement emphasising that this cultural institution will collect all artefacts of the creativity of the nation, history of the region, national literature, man-made artefacts and the priceless reaches of nature. Already in the first decade, they received precious gifts \u2013 artworks and artefacts from different donors; among them were the antiques of mayor Hradeczky, the numismatic collection of Jo\u017ee Repe\u017ei\u010d, the ethnographic collection of bishop Baraga and reverent Knoblehar, the Zois\u2019 mineral collection, Hohenwart's sea-shell collection and other artefacts. The collection also expanded due to important and amazing archaeological discoveries \u2013 Va\u010de, Ljubljansko barje (Ljubljana Marshes), \u0160marjeta, Mokronog, Drnovo near Kr\u0161ko and many more. The Provincial Museum initially had its quarters in Poga\u010dnik House in the Salendrova ulica (Salender Street) in Ljubljana; but already in October 1831, the Museum had its grand opening in the Lyceum building. There was a breakthrough for the Museum in 1882, when the Provincial Assembly decided to start construction works for a new museum building. On 14 July 1883, they laid a corner stone for the modern museum building.     Today, as we celebrate the 200th anniversary, we are looking at the past and shaping a vision of the future. It is the ambition of the Museum employees to connect our history with the present and the future, and to present it to a broader circle of enthusiasts by means of modern information technologies, and to follow our mission nobly and honourably. It is our duty to preserve the historic monuments for the next generations, and to continue genuine, respectful and direct dialogue with the public. Let the honourable jubilee be an opportunity for new directions, ideas, challenges and hope. "

      "text":" Viva! Snowstorm above Annapurna     Nepal has 2 tourist peaks in its season, where you find ideal conditions for trekking in the mountains. The first one starts in April and lasts till the end of May, the second one starts on October and ends in the end of November. In those time spans, the weather is nicest. But you still have to be prepared for unforeseen surprises. In the middle of October 2014, in the middle of the tourist season\u2019s peak, where was, out of nowhere, a worsening of weather conditions, which took over the region around the middle Nepal Himalayas. Such worsening conditions, although the autumn weather was quite stable that year, is nothing special. But this time, as it hit full-force on the region of the mountain range Annapurna, it was additionally stimulated by the remains of the Hudhud cyclone, which wreaked havoc above the Indian plains. Because of the strong rainfall, even the tourist city of Pokhara, which lies 800m above sea level, suffered broken powerlines thanks to the landslides. On the coast of the Pokhara Lake it even took 4 lives with it.     5400 m high Thorong La Pass, where most of the people in autumn 2014 died. But it was a lot worse for the higher lying regions of the Himalayas. On the well-known trekking road around Annapurna, the heavy snowfall trapped countless hikers. In 24 hours snow accumulated, as deep at 2 meters, and this on 500m above sea level. Better and worse prepared and equipped hikers were, all of a sudden, trapped in perilous situations. Mainly because the snow blizzard, and also because of the wrong decisions some of the guides and hikers on the broad region of Annapurna made, more than 40 people died. About one third of those were foreign tourists, and the other ones their hired carriers, local inhabitants. Everybody that was seized by the heavy blizzard on the upper roads was trying to get to lover grounds to save themselves. The better organized and equipped ones also made it. For many days they made their way through deep snow and fought their way down, all while sustaining heavy frostbite. Some of them were saved from death thanks to the intervention of the Nepal helicopter rescue team.     Even in the deep inners of the valley we still found some remains of landslides. 14 days after the tragedy, I visited this area. The sunny mountainsides around 5400m of the high lying mountain pass Thorong La were already dry. The shady parts of the mountains were still covered in 1 meter deep snow and some parts even more. The tremendous landslides filled the river-bed of Thorong Khola and Marsiandi and covered them with very broad snowy bridges. Witnesses told me how the atmosphere calmed down in an eerie way, just before the catastrophe stroke. The all-time present wind suddenly sufficed. Birds and other animals, which sensed what is coming, fled and brought themselves to safety. As night fell, the inhabitants of the Gundang settlement, 4000m above sea level, saw the first snowflakes falling and started to go to sleep. And as they woke the next morning, the snow accumulated and was already chest-high.     Normal dry and easy roads become quite hard to pass after snow falls. Every accident leaves a deep impression on me, because the Himalayan region is so dear to me. And even more, since the accident had so many dimensions to it. The cause of this sudden change is yet unknown and only hard to pinpoint. But I believe that good organized groups and other hikers, who would have had sufficient equipment and would not have taken the hike lightly, in normal conditions, it would not be such a hard hike to undertake and the victims would be far less. I hope that their tragedy will serve as a good warning for everyone wishing to visit this magical Himalayan region, so that they responsibly prepare themselves for the road and foresee everything, which might take place - even such extreme weather-changing conditions. And of course, that the trekking organizers see these risks in the future and what dangers they pose for the hired carriers and their hikers.     Everyday pastures around the Tilicho Lake were covered in more than 1 and half meters of snow.     Viki Gro\u0161elj     Born 3.6.1952.

The implementation of Short-term trends for Monetary Policy will be presented at the press conference at the end of this week.     The Board amended the minimum bank liquidity requirement. The required percentage share of bank liquid assets in foreign currency is reduced from 80 to 75 per cent and the required minimum amount of Bs Bills in foreign currency has been lowered from 45 to 40 per cent.     The Board took note of the Bank of Slovenia participation in the EBA STEP 2 payment system, which is characterised by low transaction costs and efficient processing for euro-denominated low value cross - border money-transfers. The Board confirmed the Bank of Slovenia willingness to create a single entry-point to the STEP 2 payment system provided a sufficient bank-interest is identified.     Upon the expiration, the Board renewed an offer to conclude new contracts for special liquidity-loans, each up to the existing maximum threshold of 15 billion slovene Tolars.     The Board adopted two new decisions on regulating Foreign- Currency Resident Accounets and Non-Resident Accounts which are replacing the existing decisions. The opening of the above accounts is now subject to the same requirements than the opening of a transaction account . Both decisions will be enacted the day after the publication in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia. "

      "text":" Barbara Ku\u017enik: Climate change is our number one enemy     \u201cIf you invest two Euros in a bike, you get five in return,\u201d says Karl Reiter, Austrian environmentalist and expert in transport and mobility. He is convinced that investing in cycling means lower healthcare costs, reduced road congestion and faster public transport. It may even save the future.     During European mobility week, as is appropriate, after more than twenty years I actually tried out a new bicycle. And so, on a rainy and windy car-free day, I tried to set a good example to my six-year-old daughter, and we both ended up constantly having to get out of the way, mostly of cars. Some people just do not care. I can understand them, because in reality there are many people who on this particular day only pretend to care.     Days dedicated to this or that are mere gestures \u2013 take part in it and everything will be forgiven! And when these days are over, we go back to our bad habits with no guilty conscience, use extremely wasteful electrical devices, burn tens of litres of petrol, drive obsessively to the closest shop and back, waste too much water, buy without restraint and too much. And finally, besides the other filth we produce every year, every Slovene throws away around 86 kilograms of rubbish, much of that food.     And then we are surprised by the weather, floods and terrible forecasts for the future.     In the past, people have often fought for a better future: against occupying forces, authoritarian rulers, misguided systems and fictitious enemies. Last weekend, the streets of metropolises like London, New York, Berlin and Brussels, as well as Ljubljana, were full of protesters who wanted to encourage world leaders to start a more determined fight against climate change.     Climate change is today the world\u2019s number one enemy. That the voice coming from the streets should be listened to and considered was mentioned even by American President Barrack Obama on Tuesday, when he gave a speech to high representatives at the United Nations Climate Summit. The fact that this summit would not bring any dramatic changes was expected. But fortunately, Leonardo DiCaprio, the newly appointed UN Messenger for Peace, in thespian style made some painful points, among them that he pretends for a living but that the present leaders of the world do not. Obama added, in a similarly dramatic tone, that we are the first generation to face the consequences of global warming and the last generation who can do something about it. This is of course all true, but where does climate change actually come from?     For the last twenty years, climatologists, meteorologists, ecologists and other scientists have been pointing out that people have managed to change the planet more in the last fifty years than they did during many past centuries. After the industrial revolution, everything developed with the speed of light, but rapid technological progress also has a dark side. While today one part of the world enjoys accumulating material goods and lives in an ivory tower of blind security, the other part of the world is going through rough times. Because of drought, war, oil, water\u2026     The Earth is calling for help. Greenhouse gases are causing global warming, melting ice in the Arctic and consequently changing the sea level and temperature. As early as the 2050s, we might see new mass emigration from flooded areas. We will be faced not only with a great ecological but also with an unimaginable humanitarian crisis. If there are no significant changes.     After a decade of applying measures to reduce the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, introducing renewable energy sources and encouraging energy efficiency, the level of carbon dioxide emissions is still increasing. Environmentalists are concerned that we might not be able to keep the global temperature increase under two degrees. Under pressure from the public and industrial lobbies politicians accept compromises that bring problem-solving efforts to a standstill. And at every downpour, people become extremely frightened because it is said that worse is yet to come.     In the European Union, climate change is discussed in all areas, but despite the fact that this topic will be a priority for a number of years, there is no particular department dedicated solely to this issue. In the new European Commission, two interdisciplinary related fields (energy and climate change) were merged into one in order to facilitate logistics and in the hope of reducing disagreement. But its stated priorities are not approved by everybody, including the Green 10, a group of the leading European nongovernmental environmental organisations, who wrote a letter to Jean-Claude Juncker criticising the new European Commission structure, which does not comply with Europe\u2019s obligations to fight climate change. They are concerned about the fact that the priority of the new Commission will be the Energy Union. The definition of this is not yet completely clear, but it is likely that the vice-president of the European Commission for the Energy Union will also or in particular have to deal with the issue of climate change.     No matter what the structure of the Commission is, in Brussels, everything revolves around climate change and the new energy policy. These are some of the goals to achieve by the end of this decade: reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990, produce 20% of energy from renewable sources and improve energy efficiency by 20%. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 40%, if we want to reduce them by at least 80% by 2050. Will we have then won?     Unfortunately, these ambitious goals are not everything. In the plans for 2030 (which will supposedly be discussed at the EU summit in October), one of the most important goals for Europe is to gain energy independence as soon as possible. Some of the EU members depend on Russian gas and in these troubled times, anything can happen. But none of us can even imagine what the world will be like then. For that reason we have to become independent and ensure safe, stable and \u2013 lest we forget \u2013 above all, green energy.     A few days ago I completed a survey in the newspaper European Voice. My answer to the question as to whether energy security should be higher on the EU priority list than the goal of reducing emissions by 2030 was of course negative. It is imperative to first reduce greenhouse gas emissions! I think globally.     But we should also act locally. An exchange economy, complete waste recycling, car sharing, the local production of fruit and vegetables, better and more efficient public transport, solar and wind energy. There are so many little things that everyone can start doing today, instead of waiting for the miracle that is predicted for the next Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015.     Changes are already taking place. Not only concerning the climate, but also changes in the way we think and act. The internet offers a selection of alternatives. Join them while you still have electricity.     Can we today even defeat climate change without the internet?

      "text":" When Hunger and Abundance Meet     The permanent exhibition When Hunger and Abundance Meet presents the eating culture from the 18th to the mid-20th century, when eating habits underwent the greatest changes, since in the 1st half of the 20th century the attitude towards food changed on a cultural level. Throughout the centuries, periods of hunger and prosperity alternated as a result of natural disasters, wars, and economic and political circumstances. Not even the upper classes escaped hunger and want; however, as a rule, the diet of the majority of the population in the past was meagre and was conditioned by the social standing of individual households.     Food is considered a cultural good, which is why the diet of previous periods is treated and understood as an important part of cultural heritage. Culinary art and gastronomy are two fields through which we can come to know cultural heritage; the changes, innovations and contemporary creativity of an individual, a family, group, inhabitants of a specific town, region, etc.; and their everyday and holidays. In societies that are experiencing shortage, food is an especially valued item; however, in the past the fundamental problem was the shortage of foodstuffs and eatables, rather than quality. In the countryside, the strict distinction between holiday dishes or dishes for special occasions and everyday food complied with the norm of a sufficient amount of foodstuffs in the house; anything better than that, was an exception to everyday life. In that time, the bourgeoisie lived differently from the nobility, and, above all, very differently from the peasants in the surrounding area. Every wealthier bourgeois family had its own cook\/housekeeper and special rooms: a dining hall and perhaps a tea room. The bourgeois kitchen wanted to be a representative, family, friendly, and hospitable kitchen on the one hand, and practical, up-to-date, and prudent on the other; it incorporated fresh culinary ideas from other regions and new imported produce. The diet, the eating style and the rules associated with eating habits reflect the status of a specific social group at a specific point in time, its wealth or poverty, its privileged or unprivileged status, its abundance or hunger. The upper classes were also privileged as regards eating habits; there were great differences particularly in food quantity and method of preparation, and in the possession and use of tableware. This is attested by the preserved kitchenware and tableware of various origin, some made by premium manufacturers, with which the homes of the dwellers of coastal towns were furnished.     The ethnological collection presents the Mediterranean bourgeois kitchen and kitchenware for storing, preparing and eating food, whereas the rural Istrian kitchen is presented in the Bardinc House in Lopar. Thus, the objects on display originate from the rural and urban environment, and show the coexistence and influence of one cultural environment on the other. The eating habits and customs from the past and the so-called traditional dishes are an excellent opening topic for discussion, with which we can draw parallels with the modern times and modern topics, such as e.g. traditional dishes in contemporary cuisine or traditional dishes and modern-day diseases (e.g. diabetes and traditional food). In any case, it is a topic that offers a wide range of opportunities for popularising cultural heritage and cooperating with diverse target groups.     The exhibition is divided into three sets: objects for storing foodstuffs, objects for preparing food, and objects for eating food. It is complemented by the didactic programme \"O\u0161terija p'r Bepu in Ju\u0107i\" (Bepo and Ju\u0107a's Inn), which is intended for the youngest visitors; it, and the entire exhibition, was designed by designers Irena Gubanc and Mateja \u0160kofi\u010d. The designers depicted the meal as an integral whole that keeps repeating itself using a circle, which is the primary motif of the formal design of the exhibition. "

      "text":" Body, Philosophy, Art     MASKA vol. XXVI, No. 137\u2013138 (spring 2011) The new volume of the magazine emerges with a new editorial board and redesigned visualisation, as well as somewhat extended field of interest which could be summarised as inter- and transdisciplinary thought of the intersections of contemporary art practices, philosophy, society, culture, science and technologies. In my view, the contemporary performing practises are anything but confined in their respective fields or even medium. On the contrary, they not only constantly reach beyond edges but this is exactly what they are all about \u2013 to incessantly re-address and redefine these verges. Always anew \u2013 to borrow the vocabulary of the Modernist discourse. Today, the positions of art change, transpose, abandon well-tracked \u2013 more or less traditional (more or less Modernist) notions of art and reach out, beyond, elsewhere. I personally consider the purpose of Maska in this very pursuit of still \u201cwarm rolls\u201d, in this unpredictable journey, in the traversing the boundaries of disciplinarity and in the movement along the fragile edges. Today, these fragile edges seem to be particularly interesting and relevant. Indeed, the performing arts flirt with and inhabit the world of new- and intermedia art and culture; in these flexible intersections emerge the most appealing and contemporary phenomena of art, culture and society which need and have to be recognised and reflected upon, sometimes also problematized.     This issue of Maska strives to follow abovementioned direction through the subject \u201cBody, Philosophy, Art\u201d which will be further addressed in the next issue. In a more theoretically-oriented part, it provides three contributions related to the philosophy of body. The original contributions by Mi\u0161ko \u0160uvakovi\u0107 and Mojca Puncer reveal various recent concepts of body and address them in their relation to the art and social practices. The third contribution \u2013 the translation of the fragment from The Structure of Behavior (1942) by Merleau-Ponty \u2013 might seem the largest (some might find it even non-contemporary) diversion from the subject. However, we deal with a key 'philosopher of body' from the phenomenological perspective who has again stirred the interest among scholars and theoreticians. Further contributions address the subject of body in the perspective of art practices, including an overview selection of body-related works presented within the Kapelica Gallery, i.e. practices using the body as their medium. Jana Pavli\u010d writes about performances on the altermainstream scene of French theatre which thematise corporeality whilst Katja \u010ci\u010digoj\u2019s contribution is dedicated to the performance In the Name of the People within the context of extended reflection on the issues of artistic freedom as well as the limits and the range of overcoming the autonomy of art. And finally the reviews of two publications issued in Slovenia in the last year. Both works \u2013 each in their own fashion \u2013 deal with body and corporeality in relation with art practices.

      "text":" Koordinacijski odbor kulture Slovenije     Torture now!     In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte wrote to Major-General Berthier that the     \u201c\u2026barbarous custom of whipping men suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished. It has always been recognized that this method of interrogation, by putting men to the torture, is useless. The wretches say whatever comes into their heads and whatever they think one wants to believe. Consequently, the Commander-in-Chief forbids the use of a method which is contrary to reason and humanity.\u201d     The CIA\u2019s Poisonous Tree David Cole     David Levine The old Washington adage that the cover-up is worse than the crime may not apply when it comes to the revelations this week that the Central Intelligence Agency interfered with a Senate torture investigation. It\u2019s not that the cover-up isn\u2019t serious. It is extremely serious\u2014as Senator Dianne Feinstein said, the CIA may have violated the separation of powers, the Fourth Amendment, and a prohibition on spying inside the United States. It\u2019s just that in this case, the underlying crimes are still worse: the dispute arises because the Senate Intelligence Committee, which Feinstein chairs, has written an as-yet-secret 6,300 page report on the CIA\u2019s use of torture and disappearance\u2014among the gravest crimes the world recognizes\u2014against al-Qaeda suspects in the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d     By Senator Feinstein\u2019s account, the CIA has directly and repeatedly interfered with the committee\u2019s investigation: it conducted covert unauthorized searches of the computers assigned to the Senate committee for its review of CIA files, and it secretly removed potentially incriminating documents from the computers the committee was using. That\u2019s the stuff that often leads to resignations, independent counsels, and criminal charges; indeed, the CIA\u2019s own Inspector General has referred the CIA\u2019s conduct to the Justice Department for a potential criminal investigation.     But the crime that we must never lose sight of is the conduct that led to the investigation in the first place. To recall: in 2002, shortly after the 9\/11 attacks, the Bush administration authorized the CIA to establish a series of secret prisons, or \u201cblack sites,\u201d into which it disappeared \u201chigh-value\u201d al-Qaeda suspects, often for years at a time, without any public acknowledgment, without charges, and cut off from any access to the outside world. The CIA was further authorized to use a range of coercive tactics\u2014borrowed from those used by the Chinese to torture American soldiers during the Korean War\u2014to try to break the suspects\u2019 will. These included depriving suspects of sleep for up to ten days, slamming them against walls, forcing them into painful stress positions, and waterboarding them.     The program was approved by President Bush himself, as well as Vice-President Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Attorney General John Ashcroft, and CIA Director George Tenet. John Yoo and Jay Bybee, Justice Department lawyers, wrote memos to whitewash the program. These acts were war crimes under the laws of war and grave human rights abuses. Yet no one has yet been held accountable for any of them. And the investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee is until now the only comprehensive effort to review the extensive classified CIA records about the program.     Even before the investigation began, the CIA appears to have been aware that its interrogation practices might not withstand scrutiny. The intelligence committee\u2019s investigation was itself sparked by a CIA agent\u2019s destruction of ninety-two videotapes of the agency\u2019s actual interrogations. According to accounts by former CIA officials, twelve of the tapes documented the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d including waterboarding. One tape showed al-Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah, apparently screaming and vomiting. In 2012, John Rizzo, who was the CIA\u2019s acting general counsel at the time the tapes were made, told the BBC that a US intelligence official who reviewed the footage had found that \u201cportions of the tapes, particularly those of Zubaydah being waterboarded, were extremely hard to watch.\u201d     But we cannot know for certain what was on the tapes, because in November, 2005, Jose A. Rodriguez, Jr., the head of the CIA\u2019s Directorate of Operations, the agency\u2019s clandestine service, ordered them destroyed. He did so over the stated objections of the White House Counsel and the Director of National Intelligence, and despite their obvious relevance to numerous possible criminal investigations\u2014of the suspects interrogated and of the CIA itself.     In 2007, when the New York Times first reported that the CIA had destroyed interrogation tapes, the Senate Intelligence Committee launched an inquiry. The CIA assured the committee that the tapes\u2019 destruction would not hinder review of its program, because it had many cables contemporaneously describing the interrogations in detail. (These would of course be the CIA\u2019s descriptions of what was done, not an actual record of what was done.) The intelligence committee requested access to those documents. The CIA replied, in Senator Feinstein\u2019s words, with a classic \u201cdocument dump,\u201d giving the committee literally millions of documents, entirely unorganized and unindexed, presumably hoping to overwhelm their limited resources.     The CIA refused to allow the Senate staff to use their own computers to review the documents, insisting that they be reviewed in a separate CIA-leased facility. According to an agreement worked out between the Committee and the CIA, the agency was to provide the committee with a     \u2019stand-alone computer system\u2019 with a \u2018network drive\u2019 \u2018segregated from CIA networks\u2019\u2026that would only be accessed by information technology personnel at the CIA\u2014who would \u2018not be permitted to\u2019 \u2018share information from the system with other [CIA] personnel, except as otherwise authorized by the committee.\u2019 It soon became clear, however, that the CIA had violated the agreement. In 2010, Feinstein explained,     I learned that on two occasions, CIA personnel electronically removed committee access to CIA documents after providing them to the committee. This included roughly 870 documents or pages of documents that were removed in February 2010, and secondly roughly another 50 were removed in mid-May 2010. Feinstein took the matter to the White House, and the CIA was compelled to apologize and to reaffirm its commitment not to interfere with the investigation. But when the CIA later learned that one of the documents the committee had received was the agency\u2019s own internal review of the cables, directed by then-director Leon Panetta, it covertly searched the committee\u2019s files yet again.     Why the concern over the internal review? From Feinstein\u2019s perspective, the CIA\u2019s real worry is that this internal review corroborates her committee\u2019s findings about the CIA\u2019s own abuses\u2014and contradicts a subsequently drafted official CIA response that tries to deny or minimize CIA abuses. As Feinstein put it, \u201cWhat was unique and interesting about the internal documents was not their classification level, but rather their analysis and acknowledgement of significant CIA wrongdoing.\u201d Apparently the CIA was willing to give the Senate committee access to all evidence except the smoking gun.     So blatant is this obstruction that the CIA\u2019s own Inspector General referred the matter to the Justice Department for a potential criminal investigation of CIA staff. In what appears to be retaliation, the CIA\u2019s acting general counsel, Robert Eatinger, in turn asked the Justice Department to investigate the Senate committee staff regarding their access to the internal review. Eatinger, Feinstein notes, was himself previously oversaw the CIA\u2019s interrogation program, and is mentioned by name some 1,600 times in the Senate committee\u2019s report. Evidently, however, he saw no conflict of interest in requesting a Justice Department investigation of those reviewing his own conduct.     How this controversy ultimately gets resolved, Feinstein rightly noted, \u201cwill show whether the Intelligence Committee can be effective in monitoring and investigating our nation\u2019s intelligence activities, or whether our work can be thwarted by those we oversee.\u201d     But even more urgent than resolution of the inter-branch dispute, is the release of the intelligence committee\u2019s 6,300-page report. Though the committee adopted the report in December 2012, not one word of it has yet seen the light of day. That the investigation has gone on so long, cost so much (reportedly $50 million), resulted in such an extensive report, and still not been seen by the public, reflects the gravity of what is at stake here. The nation\u2019s highest officials coldly approved war crimes and human rights abuses\u2014and to date, no one has been held accountable in any manner for doing so.     As I have argued before, accountability comes in many forms; there is little likelihood that former officials will be criminally prosecuted, even after the report is issued. But an official report can itself be a form of reckoning. In both Canada and the United Kingdom, official inquiries have served exactly that purpose, after the US rendition of Canadian Maher Arar to Syria, and after the UK\u2019s detention and coercive interrogation of suspected IRA members. A secret report, however, is no accountability at all. In an encouraging sign, President Obama on Wednesday said that he favors making the report public so that the American people can judge for themselves the CIA\u2019s conduct. You can bet the CIA will fight tooth and nail to frustrate that pledge. We must insist that President Obama keep this promise.     In law, we say that torture \u201ctaints\u201d an investigation. The legal doctrine that precludes reliance on evidence obtained from torture is called the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d rule. But as this latest saga reflects, torture does far more than merely \u201ctaint\u201d evidence. It corrupts all who touch it. The CIA\u2019s desperate efforts to hide the details of what the world already knows in general outline\u2014that it subjected human beings to brutal treatment to which no human being should ever be subjected\u2014are only the latest evidence of the poisonous consequences of a program euphemistically called \u201cenhanced interrogation.\u201d "

We prepare content of the protection, legislation, exhibitions, publications, and domestic and international projects.     Piran, Tartini monument     You are here     Creating a conservation plan     In May 2016, upon the request of the Municipality of Piran, we created a conservation plan for all the integral elements of the Tartini monument in Piran. Due to the specific problems and exceptional value of the monument, a larger group of experts from various areas of science and art collaborated in the preparation of the conservation plan. When documenting the initial condition and preparing a programme, we took into consideration all modern international guidelines regarding the preservation of bronze and stone outdoor monuments. We placed particular emphasis on the planning of the project\u2019s preliminary phases.     Survey results     Upon closer inspection, the Venetian sculptor Dal Zotto\u2019s masterpiece revealed not only the outstanding artistic and technological details, but unfortunately also the damage and numerous changes that time has left on its surface.     Changes and damage to the bronze occur as a result of bronze\u2019s composition, the technology used to create the sculpture, vandalism and atmospheric factors. Numerous expert studies have indicated that environmental changes with their specific macro and microclimatic conditions significantly effect the deterioration process of bronze outdoor monuments.     The current state of the statue is nevertheless not so critical as to require immediate intervention and removal from its location, but the numerous cracks and other changes and damage to the surface do cause the accelerated deterioration of material. Long-term direct exposure to all the negative environmental factors will inevitably lead to the loss of many details, which represents invaluable damage to such a piece of art. With the implementation of all the necessary conservation and restoration undertakings, and in particular the planned and regular monitoring, as well as maintenance work carried out, we are able to preserve all the exceptional details of this bronze masterpiece.     Further undertakings     The IPCHS Restoration centre gave an exact inventory of work and a cost evaluation of the conservation and restoration undertakings. Below Figure (1) We temporarily replaced the bow for the celebration of the 120th anniversary of the monument\u2019s erection. The reconstruction of the bow was made by fine art sculptor Mirko Bratu\u0161a, although, unfortunately, the original is no longer preserved. Upon the comprehensive renovation of the monument, a comparative study of Baroque bows will also be created, as we can assume the violinist used them. In September 2016, the IPCHS Restoration Centre is planning to make a 3D scan of the monument as well as conservation and restoration undertakings to the stone sections and wrought iron fence. The aforementioned undertakings will be directly accessible for public viewing together with explanations of IPCHS experts.     Mag.

      "text":" Festivalito Rural 2012     Teachers     We are proud to have Melina Sed\u00f3 and Detlef Engel teaching at Festivalito Rural. Again. Here's some basic information about them, copied from their webpage:     Stylistically, they are at home in the traditional tango de sal\u00f3n, as it is danced in Buenos Aires, and which they interpret in a very personal and modern way. Their dance captivates through its intimate embrace, playful musicality and an almost puristic elegance: a sensual interplay of man and woman without clich\u00e9 or superficial effect. Thus, their tango is newly created in every single moment, and does not just express the music, but genuine feeling.     At the core of their lessons, which are always geared towards improvisational capability, are intensive body work and analysis of tango\u00b4s structures. But \u201etechnical\u201c understanding is just a means to concentrate better on the essential: developing one\u00b4s own style and relishing the embrace in unison with the music.     If you need proof that they are welcome in many places around the world, take a look at their references.     If you like to read, check out Melina's blog. In there, you'll find her opinion on almost anything... also on Festivalito Rural ;-)     Finally, if you're more of a visual type, here's a starting point for browsing YouTube: Detlef and Melina dancing to Tormenta of Carlos di Sarli at the Festival de Kerallic in France. Watching the video you will surely realise why a blog linking to this video calls them those masters of control ;-) "

      "text":" The Korenika eco-social farm is located in \u0160alovci, at the very heart of the Gori\u010dko Landscape Park. After only a few years of operation, Korenika has already become recognizable in a wider geographical area. The professional public recognizes it as an example of good practice in social entrepreneurship, employing people with disabilities and other vulnerable social groups, as well as sheltered employment.     At the Korenika farm, we established a system of organic food production and processing. We produce crops, herbs, fruit and vegetables on over 20 hectares of land, and we also pick wild fruit and turn them into organic products.     We produce and sell our own brand of herbal teas, cold-pressed oils, dried and pickled fruit and vegetables, food for the winter, juices, syrups and much more. You can browse our offer in our online store.     We arranged a spacious herb garden and animal park, which is home to many animals popular with our youngest visitors. As the number of visitors continues to rise, we offer more and more activities and educational events in this pleasant, soothing and impressive rural environment. The increasing number of visitors has positively influenced the development of our tourist and catering offer. We offer workshops based on experiential learning for many schools and kindergartens, where children and young people can learn, relax and play at the same time.     History     In 2006, the Mozaik Society came up with the idea of opening a centre for work training and employing people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. The Mozaik Society and the Korenika Institute, established in 2008, began renovations on an abandoned farm and established the first educational and work-related activities.     We also bought some equipment; one of the items was a press for cold pressing quality vegetable oils. A few years later, the Korenika hemp oil became synonymous with one of the best varieties of oil produced from this medicinal, versatile plant. Other quality, organic products became highly popular as well, so we soon started selling them to Slovenian supermarkets and specialised organic shops.     In 2012, the legal entities working under the Korenika eco-social farm were joined by the Pribinovina company business unit, which moved from the technological park in Murska Sobota and began establishing higher quality standards in organic production and work organization in Korenika. With high investment inputs in 2013 and 2014, we completely reformed the Korenika farm and set up conditions to achieve a higher work quality.     Mission     Korenika\u2019s mission is to nurture dignity, respect and self-respect among employees and towards other people. In the future, we will continue to employ people with disabilities, people from other vulnerable social groups and offer sheltered employment. All this in line with our capabilities.     The Korenika eco-social farm strives to nurture good relationships with the local and wider environment by taking into account these words of wisdom: act local, think global. Organic products will be produced and offered to you in accordance with strict organic certificate standards.     At the Korenika farm, we respect people, nature, culture and animals. Social entrepreneurship is an innovative form of entrepreneurship with a great sense of responsibility for the society and the people. Our business motives lie in solving social, economic, environmental and other problems. This helps us create new jobs for vulnerable groups of people and do socially useful activities. Just like conventional companies, social companies are also active on the market, but the difference is that we do not share the profit, but rather bring it back into the company. Social entrepreneurship connects people by encouraging cooperation and volunteer work. In this way, we strengthen solidarity in society.     Visiting Korenika     When you visit the Korenika farm, you can spend quality time in nature and at the farm while you learn about ecology, environmental protection and farming. Human well-being as well as physical and mental health of every individual is of utmost importance.     Being aware of healthy, ecologically balanced soil management processes, food production and processing is becoming increasingly significant and therefore we work in this direction ever more frequently.     The Korenika farm is distinguished by ecological awareness and tidiness, professionalism and a cordial atmosphere among co-workers and towards guests. Here you will be able to receive and enjoy:     \u2022 Information and knowledge of organic production and processing of fruit, herbs, vegetables and cereals \u2022 Beneficial effects of the Gori\u010dko nature and the genuine nature of its people \u2022 Unforgettable adventures in interaction with tame animals and much more.     You will walk through a vast herb garden and learn the secrets of medicinal herbs care. While sitting on the bench, you will be able to observe nature, enjoy the garden\u2019s charms and gather fresh energy.     In the grasslands and forests of the former Rotceni homestead with the renovated century old house in its centre, lies ananimal park. You can visit the cultural landmark of this place, the Rotceni house, which is registered as cultural heritage, learn about its architectural features and historic landmarks of this town. The contact with tame, endearing animals will lift your spirits and stir up positive emotions.     Should you wish to do so, we will visit the nearby Lake Hodo\u0161, which is home to otters and beavers. The lake plays a significant part in protecting wild flora and fauna. Its story will impress any nature lover.     We will also prepare a rich culinary experience for closed groups. Our culinary offer is based on home-made local dishes, yet its originality and inventiveness makes it modern, so that even the most demanding guests leave satisfied.     We are currently renovating a third farm, which will house the \u0160torklja Multigenerational Centre functioning under the auspices of the Korenika farm. The \u0160torklja centre combines different activities for the local population. A choir and an Orff music group operate within this centre. The participants can enjoy literary readings, culinary and herb workshops, learn foreign languages, attend travelogues, personal growth workshops and different creative workshops for children. \u0160torklja and Korenika are becoming ever more integrated and this is why we wish that a Day Centre for the Elderly would start operating at Korenika in the future. The elderly population in the town is increasing, so it is crucial to maintain their vitality by being active, connected and living close to home.     Each year the Korenika farm hosts an eco festival, where visitors can learn about new developments and acquisitions as well as socialize over good food and music. The festival also includes a rich cultural programme, guided tours and a concert.

      "text":" The record VRR automatic locking bolts consist of a small, low-cost module that provides basic protection against burglars for your automatic sliding door. Locking is triggered automatically as soon as the operating unit or timer has received the corresponding signal. Should it do so, a steel bolt is inserted through two eyelets located at the door wings to ensure it remains in the closed position. In this way, the door can no longer slide open without use of burglar\u2019s tools and massive force.     Klju\u010davnica record SSK omogo\u010da odklepanje in zaklepanje avtomatskih vrat s klju\u010dem. Samo z obratom klju\u010da se aktivirajo vsi predhodno shranjeni na\u010dini delovanja vrat. Na ta na\u010din lahko zjutraj odprete trgovino ali poslovni prostor enako kot klasi\u010dna vrata, ne da bi se morali ukvarjati s \u010dasovniki ali uporabljati lo\u010dena zadnja vrata. Klju\u010davnico record SSK je mogo\u010de namestiti na skoraj vsako lokacijo znotraj ali zunaj stavbe.     record automatic doors are constructed to the highest standards of safety and reliability. During power outages, however, any automatic door will cease to function if it has not been fitted with a battery pack to enable it to open or function in an emergency. In this case, your automatic door can be provided with mechanical unlocking using a robust Bowden cable, or, in the case of break-out installations, to allow the door leaves to swing open.     Ve\u010dto\u010dkovno protivlomno zaklepanje record MPV je moderna alternativa tradicionalnim ro\u010dnim talnim klju\u010davnicam. Poleg izredno u\u010dinkovite za\u0161\u010dite pred vlomilci je njegova prednost predvsem v tem, da zaklepanje poteka avtomatsko. S tem se izognete bojazni, da bi se zadnji zaposleni v naglici pozabil sprehoditi do vrat in jih dodatno varnostno zakleniti.     Record AIR 290 je aktivni infrarde\u010di senzor, ki z ozko svetlobno zaveso pokriva celoten prostor med vrati do tal. Signal za odpiranje se spro\u017ei, ko \u010dlovek stopi v podro\u010dje svetlobne zavese. Primeren je tam, kjer se morajo vrata odpreti od blizu in brez dodatnih interakcij s strani uporabnika.     Senzor record AIS 290 je namenjen za sekundarno za\u0161\u010dito robov pri zapiranju avtomatskih vrat. Na voljo je namestitev v steni ali stropu oziroma v skriti razli\u010dici.     Elektronska kemilnik BDE-D je namenjena upravljanju avtomatskih vrat record. Krmiljenje je enostavno kot pri telefonu. Med posameznimi funkcijami izbirate samo s pritiskom na ikono. LCD zaslon z osvetlitvijo ozadja nudi podatke in informacije o stanju vrat, s simboli in besedilnimi sporo\u010dili. Na voljo je ve\u010d jezikov (tudi slovenski), kar na eni strani pove\u010dujejo prijaznost do uporabka, po drugi strani pa omogo\u010de hitrej\u0161e in cenje\u0161e servisno posredovanje.     Bacteria and viruses are mainly transmitted through the hands. When the door handle turns into a germ spreader, this is a problem for companies, especially in the hygiene sector. On many everyday things like smartphones, shopping carts, light switches or door handles adhere to the unwelcome bacteria firmly. For hospitals, doctors\u2019 surgeries, restaurants as well as the food processing industry the touchless switch is the perfect solution. Are the hands occupied with carrying shopping bags, anything else or by typing a message on the smartphone, the approach to the switch is enough and and the automatic door open.     In addition to the simple operation of the door, the record BLS 60 is hygienic to use, as at no time the skin comes into contact with the object.     There are various reasons for considering the installation of floor rails. Primarily designed for challenging environments, it ensures record-typical characteristics throughout the operational life of your door system.     For automatic doors that are only rarely opened, we provide this simple push-button switch. Available as a surface mounted version complete with an additional housing, or as a flush fitting, concealed version for installation in all current mounting frames.     Protective door screens supplement our range of classic linear sliding doors. They serve primarily to protect the door from damage, but also prevent malfunctions, for example when items are carelessly placed in the path of the door.     Pri analizi svojega neposrednega okolja detektor gibanja record RAD 290 stalno komunicira s krmilno napravo. Polje zaznavanja je definirano elektronsko. S tem je odpravljeno dolgotrajno mehansko nastavljanje senzorja. Tudi spremembe polja zaradi temperaturnih razlik so ve\u010dinoma nekriti\u010dne.     Senzor record RIC 290 je opremljen je s kombinacijo detektorjev gibanja in prisotnosti, ki spro\u017eijo odpiranje in zapiranje avtomatskih vrat z visoko stopnjo varnosti in zanesljivosti.     The contactless IR hygienic button triggers an opening impulse without having to touch its surface.     Unlike the infrared sensors of the record 290 series, the detection field of this contactless switch is very small, so that it triggers only if a targeted movement occurs in its immediate vicinity. Inadvertent triggering is thus avoided, making the record contactless switch ideal for applications in hospitals, such as when entering the operating theatre after disinfecting the hands to perform surgical operations.     The record wireless button is a wireless 868.3 MHz radio-controlled button that can be attached to almost any point up to 30m from the door. Pushing the button transmits a radio signal with an embedded code to the receiving unit at the door control, triggering an opening impulse. Piezoelectric technology makes the record wireless button maintenance-free, and also means it does not require batteries. Included is also an adhesive film, which enables you to attach the radio-controlled button to glass, tiles or even painted walls. "

With its 280,000 inhabitants, it ranks among the smaller European capitals but it is big enough to encompass everything expected from a capital city, while being small enough to allow people to retain their individuality.     The Social Sciences Research Institute is the largest research institute for Social Sciences in Slovenia. Research at the Institute is carried out within the framework of national and international research programmes. Intensive research is carried out within European Union research projects, but researchers and research centres are also involved in other international research.     The first thematic section, (Re)thinking the State in the 21st Century, of this issue reflects on the state and studies of the state from different perspectives and in various contexts and share the goal of re-examining hegemonic theories of the state in the new millennium. The second thematic section, Banal neoliberalism of media and political discourse is organized around the topic of the politics of mediated popular culture in the context of radical mediatization on one hand and the rise of ethno-nationalist populism on the other.     The University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Social Sciences invites applications for a University Teacher position with teaching obligations in the areas of Public Relations or Marketing Communications.     After a successfully concluded Slovenian Pre-Presidency Conference, CIR and Tepsa have prepared a report and the recordings of all sessions for anyone who was not able to attend the event or wishes to revisit the sessions. Enjoy.     Between July 1st and August 31st, library will be working on summer schedule.

      "text":" Slovenian catholic Girl Guides and Boy Scouts Association     Slovenian catholic Girl Guides and Boy Scouts Association is an independent, voluntary, youth, educational and open Slovenian scout and guide association which was established in 1990 taking into account pre-Second World War Slovenian scouting and was built up on experience and values from other scout and guide associations. We are especially thankful for the help offered by AGESCI (Associazione Guide e Scout Cattolici Italiani) who helped us at establishing the concept of our activity (structure, education, programme).     We operate for 25 years now and we are one of the most active non-governmental youth organizations in Slovenia. We have about 5200 members, aged 6-30 years (of which 800 volunteers - youth workers or leaders). Our headquarters is in capital city Ljubljana, and there are 71 local units spread across all country.     ZSKSS is a member of WAGGGS (World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts).     The primary purpose of the Association is to contribute to the full physical, mental, spiritual and social development of young people so that they can become people of strong character, responsible citizens and members of local, national and international communities. We have the status of an association of public interest in the field of education and the status of a national youth organization.     We realize our mission through the following activities:     Implementation of the program by local units (regular weekly activities, camps, winter camps and local projects)     Organization of training courses for youth leaders and workers     Organization of outdoor activities and activities related to environmental protection,     Organization of activities to promote healthy lifestyle and youth health,     Organization of educational and training activities,     Organization of sporting, cultural and entertainment activities,     Organization of humanitarian and socially-oriented projects,     Organization of promotional activities of Scouting,     Publishing journals and other publications,     Cooperation with other organizations and relevant government departments and institutions.     In addition to volunteers, the organization has five full-time employees, a secretary and four professional workers. Our offices in Ljubljana are in a long-term lease and we have another long-term lease at the Slovenia Forest Service for a house in Ko\u010devski rog. There we have the Environmental Scout Centre.     The advantage of our organization is definitely a strong network in local communities and thus a large range of target groups, and at the same time a great support apparatus of volunteers across Slovenia.

Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity.

The physical characteristics, especially the shallowness and its semi-enclosed nature, make the Adriatic and Ionian Sea even more vulnerable to these threats. These problems highlight the need for global planning and management of coastal marine areas in the Adriatic-Ionian region.     The idea for the PORTODIMARE project is based on implemented projects (SHAPE, ADRIPLAN). The aim of the project itself is to continue the activities carried out so far in these projects and to develop a maritime spatial plan for the area of \u200b\u200bthe Adriatic-Ionian region.     The goal of the PORTODIMARE project is to create a common platform - the Geoportal, which will provide access to all informations, data and tools that are necessary and important to support the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and strategic maritime planning in the Adriatic-Ionian region. The platform will operate in full compliance with the policies and principles of the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and will support the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region- EUSAIR.     The project is divided on 4 main work packages:     M- Management     The work package includes the preparation of all acts and statutory documents, ongoing management of project activities, financial management, reporting and archiving and self-assessment of project results.     T1 \u2013 Geoportal design and development     The first work package includes the creation and development of a database for the Geoportal.     T2 \u2013 Geoportal testing and demonstration: towards the plan     The second work package include the testing and the demonstration of the Geoportal.     C-Communication     As part of the communication work package, the promotion of tools, good practices and the knowledge acquired in the implemented projects will take place.     The regional development center Koper will be actively involved in all project work packages through various activities. Within the T1 work unit, it will carry out individual activities such as the T1.2 activity, which aims to determine the data needed for maritime spatial planning and the use of the protocol on integrated coastal zone management in the Mediterranean.

Special emphasis has been placed on personal interpretation with a presented example of an interpretative presentation. Interpretations are also becoming frequently included into festival events, performances, creative workshops, temporary and traveling exhibitions, artistic residency programs, scientific and research activities as well as sports programs and events. The final section of the manual contains writing aids, where the emphasis is on the fundamentals of writing and constructing an interpretative text and also features some tips for interpretative writing. The presented visual image also plays an important role in the interpretation. "

      "text":" Opening Statement by the Ambassador Dr Boris Frlec, Head of the OSCE Task Force, at the 2nd Preparatory Seminar for the 13th OSCE Economic Forum \"Migration from an Economic, Environmental and Security Perspective\" Almaty, Kazakhstan     Thank you Mr Chairman, Distinguished Deputy Minister, Distinguished Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,     I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to the host country Kazakhstan, the Office of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities as well as OSCE Center in Almaty for the excellent organization of the Second Preparatory Seminar for the Thirteenth OSCE Economic Forum. We furthermore appreciate precious assistance provided by International Organization for Migration and International Center for Migration Policy Development. I'm confident that this Preparatory Seminar will serve as an important opportunity in the further development of the traditionally rich OSCE migration discourse. It shall provide insight into most relevant migration issues of both general concern and of specific relevance to each of the OSCE regions.     Migration is driven by the natural instinct of people to move in order to seek new life and career opportunities and to increase their standard of living. But it is less the difference in income level and more the lack of opportunities which, apart from conflicts, make people leave their countries. It is a living phenomenon, a process in which migrants make significant economic contributions to societies both in countries of destination and in countries of origin. Bearing in mind that migration will continue to grow, political will is needed to understand it as a solution, not as a problem. As migration is clearly a cross-dimensional issue, with strong bearing on security, economics and the human dimension, the OSCE represents one of the very natural choices for the discussion on the subject and related affirmative action in all three dimensions.     As already highlighted in the very topical discussions and suggestions made at the First Preparatory Seminar in Trieste, migration as one of the 21st century ultimate strategic issues is far from being a zero-sum game. The demands of an increasingly globalizing and integrated world economy combined with rather gloomy demographic forecasts indicate that migration is to remain a key element of any future sustainable solution. Thus, large-scale economic migration in the OSCE area seems inevitable. The standard of living in many OSCE countries of destination would deteriorate significantly without migrants; some economic activities and entire industries would even seriously suffer without them.     However, for some OSCE countries of destination, a shrinking population does not represent the only challenge, and one which cannot be solved by immigration alone. Further, it appears that people in many OSCE countries of destination tend to accept the fact that their societies will depopulate and subsequently become less competitive, rather than embracing or agreeing to the inflow of migrants. Meanwhile, other OSCE participating States and the OSCE areas are experiencing strong population growth, oversupply of labour and swift migratory pressures. The sum of these factors constitutes them as countries of origin.     Turning to some security aspects of migration, while acknowledging that some migrants are economically very successful in countries of destination, it should also be noted that the bulk of migrants have dangerous and difficult jobs others are not ready to take. Even more, significant numbers are not being employed, making them dependent on the welfare system of the country of destination. If the ultimate goal of any OSCE country of destination is migration-integration, concerted efforts should be made to bring these people into the fold of the legal labour market of countries of destination. Illegal migrants do not pay taxes but they often have access to public services, including health and education systems. There is, hopefully, a possible role for the OSCE to call upon countries of destination to act bravely and consider the option of giving work permits to all illegal migrants who can prove they have jobs in the country. In so doing, illegal migrants would be co-opted and enabled to contribute fully to the welfare of the country of destination. It is of the utmost importance that the OSCE engage in providing channels for legal migration and assist in actions aimed at the reduction of irregular migration.     In migration-integration efforts, the socio-cultural dimension should not be underestimated either. Bearing in mind that the percentage of foreign-born legal residents in some OSCE countries of destination is as high as 35 to 40 per cent, we all need to become more multi-cultural. A volatile chemistry among natives and migrants must be cultivated in order to foster social and political stability. In this respect the OSCE could be active in providing a range of instruments and approaches to ease the integration of migrants.     Regular migration flows in the OSCE countries of destination are often managed in an overly bureaucratic manner. Subsequently, irregular migration is stimulated and the economic and social promise of legal immigration and integration cannot be realized. That is why the private sector too must have a word in the development of adequate migration management practices. Businesses are driven by growth and profit. If employers in countries of destination lack the personnel they need on the legal labour market, the gap is either filled by the illegal labour force or operations are moved elsewhere in the world to locations where cheaper labour is abundant.     There exists a potentially beneficial relationship between migration and sustainable development. As a consequence of migration, not only countries of destination, but countries of origin too can gain. Countries of origin can benefit through reduction of unemployment, remittances and skills transfer. Migration policies of countries of origin, if properly designed, can therefore alleviate poverty and reduce unemployment.     On the other hand, the movement of skilled migrants from countries of origin to countries of destination can represent a significant loss for countries providing migrants. To offer certain compensation, countries of destination should, apart from granting development aid, consider investing more substantially in the educational systems of the countries of origin.     A possible role for the OSCE is to offer countries of origin training aimed at balancing the \"brain-drain\" and \"brain-gain\" effects among countries of origin and countries of destination. The OSCE could also help countries of origin in the development and implementation of targeted reintegration programmes enabling the return of emigrants who have acquired knowledge and capital abroad that can be harnessed to contribute to economic growth back home.     Remittances represent an important \"push factor\" for the purchasing power of the national economy of the country of origin. For this reason, one of the OSCE tasks could be to encourage their formal transfer. Specifically, the OSCE could provide some assistance in the development of standards for the international transfer of remittances in order to reduce high illegal transfer costs, avoid money laundering and remittances going to illegal activities.     No country in the OSCE region is, nor needs to be alone in facing the challenges of managing migration. Thirty years ago the Helsinki Final Act of the CSCE provided a solid starting point for the development of co-operation in migration management among the participating States. A wide array of the OSCE commitments relating to migration adopted since the Helsinki Final Act are enabling participating States to develop comprehensive, coherent, co-operative and co-ordinated partnership in managing migration within the OSCE. Further development of migration management best practices combined with improved legal frameworks should be seen as an essential part of nation-building and good governance in each and every OSCE participating State. In this context, the OSCE in co-operation with other relevant international organizations may consider offering its support in drafting national migration laws in those participating States lacking adequate resources, infrastructure or expertise.     In the past decade, unprecedented progress has been made in respect to the free movement of people and the development of best migration management practices. There are now great expectations that the European Commission\u2019s forthcoming Green Paper on Legal Migration will present a vital further step forward in more effective migration management practices. Equally important are other regional initiatives, such as the Budapest Process, CIS Conference and the Intergovernmental Consultations. We also need to take full advantage of other global initiatives, including the Global Commission on International Migration, the Berne Initiative and International Labour Organisation. We rely on the expertise of International Organization for Migration, International Center for Migration Policy Development and UN High Commissioner for Refuges.     Through permanent change in their dynamics and character, migratory movements have been progressively challenging the OSCE participating States. In managing these truly important challenges, we need to act responsibly and find appropriate modus operandi for cooperation among existing agencies. If we are really concerned with constructing a more integrated and coherent migration management we should concentrate sincerely on the wiring and plumbing of the key actors in the field. Only in this way can we hope for effective synergies and the subsequent encouraging results. In this sense, the Chairmanship is convinced the Seminar will yield useful suggestions.     Thank you.

Information for editors     Since May 25, 2018, a new Data Protection Regulation (GDPR \u2013 General Data Protection Regulation) is in force. GDPR is a regulation designed to protect the personal data of EU residents and enforce data privacy rules. It also enforces how organisations collect, store and use personal information.     1KA is an open source application that supports and combines all the stages of the data collection process through online surveying. In this context, a registered user 1KA, who is the author of a particular survey (and related data), plays the role of a controller, and the 1KA application has the role of a contracted processor. The editor or survey author is the owner of the survey, which is responsible for all information and data generated and collected using the 1KA tool. At the same time, he is also responsible for the fulfilment of all the requests made by respondents for his surveys (request for deletion, access, modification or personal or survey data).     Accordingly, the latest upgrade of the 1KA application brings many innovations that allow survey authors to conduct a survey in accordance with the regulations and requirements of the new regulation.     From the perspective of the author of the survey, he has the following options as an editor:     The GDPR profile settings, where the editor can edit his GDPR profile, monitor the list of his surveys that are potentially bound to GDPR and processes request for deletion, alteration or insight into the survey data provided by respondents for his surveys.

      "text":" The gallery displays 134 graphic prints by Zoran Mu\u0161i\u010d, which were donated by the artist in 1991 to the then municipality of Nova Gorica and to the Regional Museum Gori\u0161ki muzej for safekeeping. The graphics were created between 1949 and 1984. The exhibition begins with images of the Dalmatian and Siennese landscape and the well-known scenes with horses. It continues with the cycle of Dalmatian landscape, in which he came closest to abstraction. The lagoon near Chioggia is depicted with its typical fishing nets, as is Venice in the cycle \u201cCanale della Guidecca\u201d. In addition to the series of vegetal motifs, his depictions of rocky landscapes are also on display; these were inspired by the Dolomites and the Fontainebleau forest. The collection also presents works from the dramatic cycle \u201cWe Are Not the Last\u201d (Nismo poslednji) that Mu\u0161i\u010d developed based on his torturous experience at a Nazi camp and which grew into a general condemnation of the destruction of human life.     Anton Zoran Mu\u0161i\u010d was born in Bukovica near Gorizia on 12 February 1909. During World War I, when he was still a child, he went with his family to the regions of Koro\u0161ka and \u0160tajerska as a refugee. He finished his schooling at the College of Education in Maribor in 1928 and enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. In 1934, he graduated under the mentorship of Professor Ljubo Babi\u0107. In the following year, he visited Spain for a few months, which was where Professor Babi\u0107 sent his students, and he copied many works of Goya in the Prado Museum in Madrid. Between 1934 and 1940 he often travelled to Dalmatia, which had a great impact on his artistic development. In 1937, he became a member of Klub neodvisnih slovenskih umetnikov \/ Club of Freelance Slovenian Artists. He was also a member of the Maribor fine artists\u2019 club called Brazda. In 1944, he moved to Venice where he met the Ferrarese painter Filippo de Pisis and his circle. That same year, he was deported to the Dachau concentration camp, where he created a series of shocking drawings, from which he developed a cycle of oil paintings and graphics in the Seventies entitled \u201cWe Are Not the Last\u201d.     After World War II, Mu\u0161i\u010d lived in either Venice or Paris; in the latter he worked under the auspices of Galerie de France after 1953 and belonged to the group \u00c9cole de Paris. He exhibited his works all over the world and received high praise and international awards. Zoran Mu\u0161i\u010d died in Venice on 25 May 2005. With his rich oeuvre he made a name for himself already during his lifetime as one of the most important post-war creators of modern art, who drew his inspiration from various milieus, cultures and people, and who depicted the total fragility and beauty of life through purified, refined drawing.

V kolikor bo voditeljici priljubljene pogovorne oddaje nepremi\u010dnino uspelo prodati po tej ceni, bo na njej zaslu\u017eila kar 6 milijonov dolarjev, saj jo je pred dvema letoma kupila za 18.6 milijona dolarjev.     Vila ima skoraj 640 m2 bivalne povr\u0161ine in se lahko pohvali s tremi spalnicami ter tri in pol kopalnicami. Zraven je tudi hi\u0161ica za goste, ki ima eno spalnico in dve kopalnici.

Stopim iz sence hi\u0161, stoje\u010dih tesno druga ob drugi, in \u017eiva svetloba nad staromestnim trgom malone zaslepi spev.     largo     I     V ogledalu neba se zrcali neskon\u010dnost. Le\u017ee\u0161 na hrbet v mokro travo in opazuje\u0161, kako potuje ro\u017enat oblak v vijoli\u010den somrak. Potem z mislijo, po\u010dasi, \u0161e enkrat obide\u0161 prizor. Kon\u010dnost se odmika v daljavo. Od znotraj prihaja zvok violine. Hite\u010d za zvokom, za odmevom tega zvoka, prispe\u0161 zadihan, ves moker od rose.     II     S toplim nemirom rok bo\u017ea\u0161, kot bo\u017ea otrok grad iz sipine, vzpetine moje razprte golote. Z \u017eejnim vonjem lepote polaga\u0161 na \u017eeljni obok telesa poti, kamor greva objeta, pod brezmejnim lokom drevesa, velikim kot sinja ljubezen dneva. Vseh dni.     III     Soj medene lune sledi poti jezika, ki sredi obale oku\u0161a sok s svile kot cipresa vitkega telesa. Sledi zvezd sredi ko\u017ene jase, okopane v sladkosti vro\u010dice, se izgubljene v kipenju lastnih vzdihov kri\u017eajo na razprti dlani no\u010di. Zaprem o\u010di, vse v meni \u0161\u010demi in utripa. Tema odhaja in zora gori v svetlobo dozorele strasti.     IV     Na postelji, \u0161e topli od ljubljenja, ostaja z meglico zaspanega sonca izslikan odtis. Vdihavam vonj iz rjuhe pome\u010dkane, kjer si le malo prej iz ikebane mojega telesa odpoljubil pesmi, prej \u0161e neprebrane. Skozi lino no\u010di se zlati odhajajo\u010da mese\u010dina in z njo tvoj zapis, Selena, luna, obsijana s svetlobo karmina.     andante     I     V prahu sipkega peska sva pustila goli obris utripov srca, z vitkimi prsti zarisan napis za nevidne bogove neba. Vetrovi, skriti pod krili ptic, podijo kopaste oblake, lebde\u010de nad \u0161irnim zalivom. Ob glasovih milih strun ju\u017enih vetrov, z zlatilom oson\u010dnenih jader, vodi\u0161 belo barko v pristan. Splivkana voda pomirja, bo\u017ea.     II     Z okusom srebrne pene valov zori jutro na belih svilenih prevlekah soli, ki jih \u0161e ni spral de\u017e z odprtega morja. S slutnjo sladkosti svitanja se selim v resni\u010dnost z vrhov najvi\u0161jih slasti, kjer drhtijo sanje. Tvoja ko\u017ea di\u0161i po bakreni zagorelosti, ki se ogreje v pohotnosti vod. Odpiram in zapiram se, \u0161koljka, na poroznih policah, s katerih se morje umika in se vra\u010da nanje.     III     Glas neznanih morskih ptic, ki re\u017ee zati\u0161je spe\u010dega morja, vabi v \u010darne privide, skrite za robom obzorja. Pred zarjo, ki sine, srkam vase magi\u010dne meje slasti, ovite med nevidne \u010deri nebe\u0161kih polj, ki jih prekriva presojna, drhte\u010da tan\u010dica jutranje rose. Na oltar drobnih prsi z vihravo slo kot Eol, bog vetrov, daruje\u0161 oro\u0161eno telo.     IV     Katedralo z dvema zvonikoma in majhnimi starinskimi stolpi\u010di, dvigajo\u010dimi se z ostrimi konicami proti oblakom, in baro\u010dne linije ni\u0161 okoli nje, barva rde\u010dkast nadih. Tvoj dih, ki je usoda, zaspi ob mojem vratu, iz\u010drpan in sladko utrujen. Le vri\u0161\u010d angelskih glasov, napolnjen s po\u017eelenjem, \u0161e vznemirja tiho no\u010d.     allegro vivo     I     Zvok neujemljive domi\u0161ljije nagovarja z nagajivim bli\u0161\u010dem in sijajem. Po kotih terase, na bambusovih pre\u010dnikih, so posejani redki in skrivnostno di\u0161e\u010di cvetovi divje azaleje. Dih sve\u017eine preveva resast \u0161krlat pravlji\u010dne preje in prsi pre\u0161inja velika, nedopovedljivo lepa sre\u010da. Sredi njenih valujo\u010dih glasov se zdim kot posoda, ki jo z grozdjem polni\u0161, Bakhus, da me pije\u0161 sladko, da me mami\u0161.     II     Kot krhko vazo iz porcelana me krasi\u0161 s cvetjem besed in mi \u010dute pretresa\u0161 kot burja, ki plane v je\u010de\u010de bore otoka. Sr\u010dni utrip si, rde\u010da mana, drget, ki me o\u017eivlja, vznemirjenje, ki ude razvezuje. Vihar si, ki polje v meni. Kri. In roka, ki po boku polzi. Na obokih ru\u0161evin z Mane zarana stoka galeb od u\u017eitka.     III     Vsako jutro znova vzide sonce skozi tvoje od sle v tanke re\u017ee priprte o\u010di, iz katerih zeleno vre vse, kar me opaja. Vedrina si, smeh, ki \u0161kreblja po ble\u0161\u010davi zob sredi poletja. Ujeta v trepet tvojih rok, v vsak tvoj zamaknjen pogled in pod zaprtimi vekami v niz podob sem, kot otrok, nemirna v pri\u010dakovanju: kot igriva galeba sva, ki ne i\u0161\u010deva zavetja pod prostranim obokom neba.     IV     Potopljena v oran\u017eno son\u010davo, zamaknjena v ekstazi, otrpla v vonju, ki se skozi pore plazi, se nad pene\u010dim se valom morja loviva s pogledi. V o\u010deh, ki vidijo vse, tudi na videz najnepomembnej\u0161e podrobnosti, je vsak dotik sve\u010dana podoba, ki jo s prsti mehko izpisuje\u0161 po ko\u017ei. Takrat so v zraku, ki ima barvo in vonj tvoje polti, ve\u010deri podobni biserni ro\u017ei.     piano     I     Pro\u010delja ljubkih hi\u0161 in kupole cerkvice, obrnjene proti vzhodu in osvetljene z jutranjo zarjo, barva harmonski akord, rahel in ne\u017een kot prvi poljub. Nemirna svetloba se spu\u0161\u010da iz ozkih oken visoko nad oboki in objema pozlate na baro\u010dnih okvirjih prelepih slik. Na oltarju visi podoba neba, ki ga pokriva devi\u0161ka barva, svetla kot \u017earek v \u017eeljnih o\u010deh. Iz velikih orgel lije lilast slap melodij, ki drhti v razko\u0161ju obljub.     II     Bronast zven zvonov lebdi v mraku. S paleto ob\u010dutkov, vpletenih v svilo dolgih, svetlih las, me razvaja\u0161 do tan\u010din, globoko, v dno vesolja. Dvigujeva se na krilih te lebde\u010de melodije: ko sledi\u0161 premenam v hi\u0161i moje du\u0161e, se vse tvoje bitje vanjo prelije. Kro\u0161nje dreves pojejo v ve\u010dernem zraku.     III     \u010carobna podoba \u017eare\u010dih odbleskov se ble\u0161\u010di od mokrote. V neustavljivem ritmu letiva vi\u0161e in vi\u0161e, do vratu potopljena v neulovljiv odmev potujo\u010dih valov. Spodaj se peni tenko speta mese\u010dina. \u010cisto z vrha odplavam lahno in po\u010dasi kot peresce z neba.     IV     Ob oknu, kjer slutim globino ve\u010dera, trepetajo krila no\u010dnega metulja, na katerih so izvezena ble\u0161\u010de\u010da o\u010desa. V kotu o\u010di se rosi milina. V tvojem naro\u010dju, ljubljena kot violina, vzdignjena v vrh zvezdne ceste, na pobo\u010dju beline neba le s krili lebdim, angel, brez telesa.     Underneath a tall bronze statue, half-way up some climbing steps, a sea of faces, still, but swelling from within, listens to a Bach Concerto: the echoing expanse of time seems like an inspiration. I leave the shadows of the huddling houses, while the vibrant light spilling over the old-town square almost drowns the song.     Largo     I     The mirror of the sky reflects infinity. You lie down on your back in damp grass and watch a pink cloud sail into the violet dusk. Then slowly\u2014in your thoughts\u2014you see it once again. Finitude draws into distance. The sound of violin comes from within. Chasing the sound, the echo of the sound, you arrive, gasping, and covered in dew.     II     With the warm restlessness of hands, you caress, like a child caresses castles out of sand, the mounds of my unfolded bareness. With the hungry smell of beauty, you cover the aching curves of my body with roads which we walk embraced, under the endless arch of the tree, as immense as the azure love of the day. Of all days.     III     The moon\u2019s honey glow on the shore follows the trail of the tongue tasting the sap from the silken body, slender as a cypress tree. Traces of stars in the clearing of skin, bathed in sweet fever, criss-cross the open palm of the night, lost in the seething of their own sighs. I close my eyes; everything within me is burning and pulsing. Darkness is leaving and dawn is burning in the flush of ripe passion.     IV     In the bed still warm from making love, an imprint remains, painted in the mist of a sleepy sun. I breathe in the scent of the crumpled sheet where you\u2019ve just kissed away poems never read before from the ikebana of my body. The waning moonlight gilds the window of night, and your inscription, Selene, Luna, glowing in carmine light.     Andante     I     In the dust of dry sand, we left the naked outlines of our heartbeats, inscriptions made with lean fingers for the invisible gods of the sky. The winds, hidden underneath birds\u2019 wings, chase the fluffy clouds gliding over the expanse of the bay. With the soft voices of southerly winds and golden sunlight in the sails, you steer your boat into the harbour. The rippled water soothes, caresses.     II     Tasting of the waves\u2019 silver foam, the morning ripens on the silky white covers of salt that haven\u2019t been washed away by the rains from the open sea. With the premonition of sweet dawn I move to reality from the highest heights of ecstasy, the place of trembling dreams. Your skin smells of the copper tan heated in lustful waters. I open and close, a seashell on the porous ledges from which the sea pulls back, only to take them again.     III     The voice of strange seabirds that cuts the calm of the sleeping sea lures into charmful visions hiding behind the horizon. Before the breaking of dawn, I soak up the magic limits of ecstasy spun round the invisible rocks in the heavenly fields, covered by the translucent, shivering veil of the morning dew. At the altar of small breasts you offer up your dewy body with the tumultuous lust of Aeolus, god of the winds.     IV     The cathedral with two bell towers and small ancient turrets rising in sharp pinnacles towards the clouds, and the baroque lines of the encircling niches, are glowing in a reddish hue. Your breath, my destiny, sleeps against my neck, worn out with sweet exhaustion. Only the cries of angelic voices, full of lust, disturb the quiet night.     Allegro vivo     I     The sound of uncatchable imagination speaks with playful lustre and spark. In the corners of the terrace, on bamboo canes, a few blossoms of the mysteriously smelling wild azalea are dotted around. A whiff of freshness breathes through the fringed purple of fairy-tale yarn and my chest is imbued with great, unspeakably beautiful happiness. Amid its swelling voices, I seem like a vessel you fill with grapes, Bacchus, to dink me sweet, to tempt me.     II     You adorn me like a fragile porcelain vase with blossoms of words and shake my senses like the northerly wind that rushes into the moaning pines of the island. You are a heartbeat, red manna, a shudder of life, a thrill untying my limbs. A tempest that swells in me. Blood. A hand that slides down my hip. From the arches of the ruins on Mana, a seagull cries out with pleasure.     III     Each morning anew the sun rises through your eyes, narrowed into slits with lust, and everything gushes out greenly and sates me. You are brightness, laughter tingling on the sparkle of teeth in high summer. I am caught in the trembling of your hands, in your every pensive gaze, and in a line of images under closed eyelids, like a child, restless in expectation: we are like playful seagulls that do not look for shelter under the expanse of the sky.     IV     Immersed in the orange sunglow, entranced in ecstasy, numbed by the scent crawling through the pores, we catch each other\u2019s eye over the white-capped waves. In the eyes that see everything, even the seemingly most unimportant details, every touch is a solemn image that your fingers softly outline on my skin. Then the air, with the hue and scent of your tan, seems like a blossom of pearl.     Piano     I     The fronts of charming houses and the cupola of the little church facing east, lit up with the morning dawn, are coloured by a harmonic chord, soft and gentle like a first kiss. Restless light is moving down from narrow windows high above the arches, embracing the gold on the baroque frames of wonderful paintings. At the altar, an image of the heavens hangs, covered in virginal colour, bright as the glimmer in hungry eyes. From the great organ pours a purple cascade of melody, quivering in the plenty of promise.     II     The bronze chime of bells hangs in the air. With a palette of senses, entwined in the silk of long fair hair, you indulge my every fibre, profoundly, to the deepest depths of the universe. We rise on the wings of this gliding melody: as you follow the movements in the house of my soul, all your being pours into it. Treetops sing in the evening air.     III     The magic image of glowing reflections is glistening with wetness. In an unstoppable rhythm we fly higher and higher, immersed to our necks in the unchatchable echo of travelling waves. Underneath, the soft-woven moonlight sparkles. From the very top, I swim down gently and slowly, like a feather from the sky.     IV     By the window, where I feel the deep of the evening, the wings of a night butterfly flutter, embroidered with gleamy eyespots. In the corner of the eye, grace is gathering in a drop. In your arms, loved like a violin, lifted to the top of the stars, on the slope of the whiteness of sky, I glide on nothing but wings, an angel, bodiless. "

      "text":" How to Fish with Plastic Worms? Best Tips ...     Using live worms as baits can be highly efficient, but what about artificial ones?     Plastic worms are sold in almost every fishing store around the world and they are available in all kinds of colours and sizes.     There is a lot of fish species that react to worms, including the plastic worms, and the popular bass is one of them.     When choosing a plastic worm, you must consider factors like the targeted fish specie and water colour to get the best results.     To find out how to fish with plastic worms read the following chapters:     Do Fake Worms Really Work for Fishing?     Some anglers are very suspicious towards fake worms but there is no valid reason for that. Artificial lures of all kinds are frequently used as baits and there is no reason to always avoid them. The same goes for worms.     In fact, artificial worms can sometimes be more effective than the real ones. They are made to \u201cwiggle\u201d in a similar way to the real ones so you do not have to worry about will the movement attract the fish. Unlike the real ones, these have to be moved by an angler, but in the world of artificial baits, there are quite easy to manage.     Unlike real worms they don\u2019t have to be cut in pieces because they come in different sizes and you will not have to struggle with hooking them.     Various colours can be chosen depending on a location and fish species. Those colours are much more versatile than the colours of real worms. And that is especially important in murky waters, where real worms are less visible.     The downside is that they lack natural smell that the real ones have, but some models can be bought scented.     Inexperienced anglers, or anglers who just don\u2019t have experience with plastic worms often think that a plastic worm should be similar to the real one when it comes to outside appearance.     That is probably one of the reasons they have to avoid these plastic lures, because most of them look quite different.     As already said, their colourful appearance is there to attract the fish more than a pale-looking real worm.     And lastly, unlike real worms, plastic ones won\u2019t be \u201cstolen\u201d from the hook by small fish species, or you will have to replace them on the hook every once in a while, because they die or lose colour and smell underwater.     How to Fish with Plastic Worms? Best Tips ...     Fishing with plastic worms is very similar to fishing with the real ones and it is quite simple, even for beginners.     If you want to try fishing with these lures, you will need a light gear, a reasonably sized hook and the corresponding fishing line.     Same as with the real ones, do not overcomplicate things. If you wish, you may also use floats. Choose it in accordance with the fish you are trying to catch.     When choosing a hook, use the one with the straight shank. It will make the worm movement more natural, especially when casting. Plastic worms have a tendency to slide down the hook eye so using the right hook will ensure perfect hooking.     Avoid using very large hooks as they will often result in less bites.     When moving the lure, avoid dragging and reeling in a \u201cperfect\u201d pattern at high speed. Hopping the lure will look more natural. You can also let it sink naturally, and if there is no fish interest, repeat the process. If you are fishing in an area with a lot of underwater vegetation, slow down the movements.     When holding a rod, avoid large movement with the rod tip. Instead, twitch the worm gently ...     Some species, especially bass, will bite in the moment when the plastic worm sinks naturally towards the bottom.     Always have a few different worms in your tackle box and change them on the spot if necessary. The same goes for hooks. You can\u2019t expect that a single worm will always work, in any location with any fish. Try and test them, especially if you are fishing on an unfamiliar location.     When choosing a line, use thee one that is less visible to fish. Using fluorocarbon may help you with that in certain situation. It is less visible to fish and it is not stretchy, which means straight and direct transfer of energy on larger hooksets.     All of these tips are useful in many situations when using plastic worms as baits, but keep in mind that you should always chose every piece of your equipment depending on species you are trying to catch.     What Kind of Fish do you Catch with Plastic Worms?     When you figure out how to fish with plastic worms, the next question that comes is what kind of fish can you catch with them?     Numerous fish species can be caught by using these baits, an the most popular is probably bass.     Bass is one of the most popular choices for anglers, both beginners and those with more experience. Details about bass fishing with plastic worms are going to be mentioned in the next chapter.     Other species that can be caught on plastic worms are panfish species, bluegill and sunfish. After bass, those are the ones who are very attracted to plastic worms.     Some anglers fish for trout using smaller, finesse worms. This technique can be effective but there are often more productive methods than this one.     Crappies and walleye can also be caught with plastic worms. Curly-tail plastic worms are the ones to choose for walleye.     It is worth mentioning that not all fish who bite on live worms will also bite on plastic ones. One of the best examples is catfish. Real worms may be good for smaller specimens but artificial worms lack strong smell that is important for species like catfish.     When fishing for any of the given species, make sure you choose the correct plastic worm.     How to Catch Bass with Plastic Worms?     Bass reacts incredibly well on plastic worms.     They seem and feel like a natural food so the bass is likely to suck it and hold it for a while before spitting it out. That times is valuable for the angler as it gives you opportunity to react in time.     Some plastic worms are even available scented, to attract even more fish attention.     When choosing a rig, most bass anglers use simple and very effective Texas rig. Some even use variations without the weight. This rig owes its popularity to the fact that any type and size of the plastic worm can be used. Weights can slide or they can be fixed in place.     When the lure is positioned on the bottom, always have a slight tension in the line. Bass will suck the bait gently and if your line is loose, there is a chance that you won\u2019t feel it.     When working the bait, letting it sink naturally and hopping it is way better than dragging it around.     If you are fishing in clear water, use a bit smaller one (around 3 inches) to seem natural and not to scare off the fish. In murky waters you should use those that are more visible and larger (5 or more inches).     If you want to maximize your success, consider time of the year and adjust the bait size and colour. Slow moving bass in the time of natural food shortage will be suspicious towards large and bright prey. It should correspond to available natural food.     When choosing a shape, you should go for curly tail option in dark, murky waters, because they produce more vibration and movement. In clear waters you can use the ones with straight tail.     Straight shank hooks are widely used for bass fishing with plastic worms and you can\u2019t go wrong with those. There is another option too, and that is wide gap hooks, which are great for larger worms and larger bass.     Whatever option you decide to use, feel free to change it if you feel like there is not a lot of fish action.     What are the Best Plastic Worms for Fishing (and Colours)?     When talking about plastic worms, we must know the differences among all kinds available on the market.     There are two main groups and those are straight tail and curly tail plastic worms.     Straight tail is a simple choice, highly effective and it has different types, such as trick-worms, finesse-worms, stickbait-worms and many others.     Curly tail worms also have different types, such as ribbon-worm, U-tail and other variations. Those worms wiggle more and make more vibrations. Their movement is a great asset when fishing in darker waters, when the fish can sense the movement before actually seeing it.     Among numerous models and manufacturers, you will not go wrong if you choose classics, like Zoom Magnum II Worm. Those are ribbon tail worms, 9 inches long, great for larger hooks and the colour to choose is green pumpkin. Their movement will attract the bass and they have been on the market for a very long time.     There are numerous manufacturers, some of them are new and some have been around for years. When choosing the right worm, think about size, colour, weight and style.     Colour should be chosen according to water colour. Use natural-looking in clear waters, such as different shades of green or brown, but not too bright. In murky waters you can play with colours, or use multi-coloured worms.     When it comes to size, except using slightly smaller in clear water, you should choose those that are suitable for targeted fish size. The larger the bait, the larger the catch. But here is a catch, small bait can still attract large fish, but a large bait will almost never catch a small fish. If there is no action, maybe you should downsize a bit, especially if you are a beginner. Also, use smaller ones in winter and larger in summer.     There are no right and wrong worms, every model and type is right for certain conditions and you should always have a few worms with you.     Conclusion     Fishing with plastic worms, especially bass fishing, can be highly productive.     When choosing among hundreds of different models, keep it simple and choose the type that suits weather and water conditions, fish size and time of the year.     Having a small collection of worms in your tackle box can be very beneficial. A lot of models are reasonably priced so you can test them at your preferred fishing spot.     Now when you know how to fish with plastic worms, there is one more tip; when using two-coloured worms, choose those that have a dominant natural colour and the bright and unnatural part is much smaller. They will attract fish but still look somewhat natural, and they can be used in various situations.

Gradually, the sea withdrew and mother earth, through the centuries, created an idyllic landscape strewn with hills, intertwined with brooks and streams, covered with lush greenery. Landscape, which gradually descends to the vast plains of Friuli and the horizon disappears into the depths of the Adriatic Sea.

      "text":" The Glossary of Common Knowledge is a project of the European confederation of museums L\u2019Internationale initiated by Moderna galerija in 2014 and organised cross-sectionally from working seminars and public conferences. The goal of the project is to compile a glossary of art terminology that differs substantially from what is found in the existing literature on art. This time, the referential field is Subjectivisation. We also prepared a special public radio show, accessible on L'Internationale Online and partly also on Radio Student, Ljubljana, produced by Radia Al Hara (Palestine), Bridge Radio (Copenhagen) and L'Internationale Online.     SEMINAR     Each edition begins with a public event, followed by several working days, in which a group of invited participants who act as \"narrators\" proposing new terms around a given \"referential field\u201d. All the sessions of the seminar will be recorded and published on the Glossary of Common Knowledge website.     The Glossary of Common Knowledge (GCK) seeks to find common knowledge to speak about less visible stories in contemporary art, and to address systems that govern our ways of thinking in art and beyond. The project is ongoing since 2014 and is based on discussions surrounding six referential fields (Historicisation, Subjectivisation, Geopolitics, Constituencies, Commons, and Other Institutionality). The first series of discussions was published in 2018 and now we are working on the second edition. For this second series we are working again with these same referential fields in order to re-examine how the conditions in our cultural landscape have changed. In May 2021, a group of narrators is being invited to propose terms for the Glossary, to speak about the notion of Subjectivisation with respect to their current research and\/or artistic practice and shifting cultural conditions. With this referential field we are interested in interpretations of subjectivities that are critical toward dominant ways of producing subjectivisation and the exploitation and commodification of intellect and affect by capital. This subjectivisation is produced from the rebellion and critical situatedness of both individual and collective.     We understand subjectivisation as a potentially transformative process that confronts the judgments and biases in our societies and poses critical questions about who we are, and how we act in the world. It works in the direction of forming aesthetical, ethical and political statements and decisions that are to an extent unrepresentable, historically situated, fragmented and inconsistent, yet capable of weaving political affinities, that bring about social transformation. A collective subjectivity that experiences common trauma may form a solidarity movement that challenges systematic violence in political realities despite the existing intersectionality between its members. The opposite of subjectivation is identification; that is, the police activity of assigning to each body its \u2018natural\u2019 place and function. The process of subjectivisation is about citizens becoming makers and not only subjects of public policies and institutions. In a world facing pandemic, climate change, migrations, economic and social struggle, terrorism and an array of new communication technologies we observe growing social, political and economical tension resulting in an ever-more stratified society. Subjectivity-as-encounter is a way to promote the possibility of sharing borders, margins and thresholds with empathy.     Organised by the L'Internationale confederation with HDK-Valand Academy of Art and Design at the University of Gothenburg (Gothenburg, Sweden) and Moderna galerija (Ljubljana, Slovenia)     PUBLIC PROGRAMME     On the occasion of 2021\u2019s Glossary of Common Knowledge seminar on Subjectivisation L\u2019Internationale Online proposes to engage a fluid network of listening sites where provocations on the relations between\/of essentialism and subjectivisation may be positioned and disseminated, thereby offering greater accessibility and geographical reverberance. The shift to digitisation caused by the pandemic provides a grounding from which to enquire into the physicality of interaction and therefore we invite participants, readers and listeners to actively engage with their senses over various forms of frequencies via a series of radio programs. Recognising the polyphony of symphony, an aim is to catalyse a space through which to negotiate theories, practices and entanglements around essentialism and subject becoming, through radio programs that unpack sonic migration, what is essential to decolonial research and disembodied performances. In identifying radio as a potential form and circulatory mechanism we seek to acknowledge a poly-cultural and cacophonous approach that is also attentive to radio as a significant media amidst the global pandemic. Our proposition is to enter into dialogue with a series of radio stations - as critically situated sites of radio production and broadcasting - across differing locales in order to further develop debate on the concept of subjectivisation, which is a theme in the development of the current Glossary project. We understand subjectivisation, broadly, as a potentially transformative process that confronts judgments and biases in our societies and discussions which can pose critical questions about who we are, how we act in the world; and in what ways particular situations, structures and resulting forms of exclusion inform and constrain what is made possible.     CONVERSATION | Musician Khyam Allami and architect Nora Akawi     Tuning and the problematics of transcultural creativity     Monday, 10 May 2021, on L'Internationale Online and Radio \u0160tudent, R A D A R, Ljubljana (at 11 p.m.)     With the release of two free programs that encourage experimentation with global tuning systems Leimma and Apotome, the musician and researcher Khyam Allami is challenging the Western biases of music production software.     RADIO DRAMA | Our Movements Are Loud     Production: Bridge Radio, Copenhagen, 29:05 min     Tuesday, 11 May 2021, on L'Internationale Online and Sunday, 16 May 2021, 6 p.m., Radio \u0160tudent, R A D A R, Ljubljana     The radio drama is an experimental radio play produced collectively by people without Danish citizenship, linked to each other through their experience of the asylum system in Denmark. The radio play consists of different perspectives, positions and voices that coincide in a story about the fight against expulsion. These interwoven stories take place in an imaginary scenario and are told by activists working inside and outside the asylum camps. The stories in the radio play are based on real events that have taken place in asylum camps, airplanes and in larger protests that The Bridge Radio and its network has participated in.     The process of creating the radio play started with a workshop in writing and drama for radio with writer Athena Farrokhzad, director Saga G\u00e4rde and sound designer Arash Pandi.     Sound recordings from the Bridge Radio Archive: Quotes by Audre Lorde, Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture, Nicholas De Genova and Bertolt Brecht.     Radio drama workshop: Athena Farrokhzad and Saga G\u00e4rde.     Recordings and editing: The Bridge Radio.     Sound design: Arash Pandi.     RECORDED POEMS by Napo Masheane in collaboration with Francis Lo, What About Struggle and What About Support     Recorded poems by Napo Masheane in collaboration with Francis Lo from the upcoming e-publication of the L'Internationlale Online edited by Corina Oprea and Jeniffer Hayashida on the proposition to resituate the critique of catastrophe discourse in urgent pasts and presents. What about support and what about struggle is an international speculative translation project where writers and artists across a range of geopolitical contexts have responded to Francis Lo\u2019s work across languages, forms, and aesthetic-political concerns. Poets and artists contributors: Napo Masheane, Leuli Eshraghi, Merve Unsal, Taco de Raya, Lukaza Branfman-Verissimo, and Fernanda Laguna.     The Glossary of Common Knowledge is a part of a four-year programme Our Many Europes led by L'Internationale confederation of museums with its partners Valand Academy (University of Gothenburg) and National College of Art and Design Dublin. Supported by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union, Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia and Igor Zabel Association for Culture and Theory. "

Opis proizvoda     Tehni\u010dki podaci     The FX Wildcat may be the perfect compact airgun. Beautifully balanced, light weight, smooth cocking, and featuring a trigger that would be exceptional on any rifle, let alone a bullpup. The original Wildcat upon its debut in 2015, quickly became a top selling airgun the world over. Now in 2018 FX\u2019s engineers have brought us the Wildcat MKII.     The MKII builds upon the groundbreaking Wildcat, adding the all new FX Interchangeable Barrel Liner System. This is the system that allows users the ability to exchange barrel liners, and if desired upgrade the FX Smooth Twist barrel liner that comes standard with the MKII, to an upgraded FX Smooth Twist X Barrel. The X Barrel liner is a fully rifled smooth twist barrel, available in varying twist rates and bore specifications that tailor to the vast array of airgun projectile weights and shapes.     This new barrel system lends to a Wildcat that is now much lighter in hand. Other upgrades include an upgraded reloading mechanism, trigger, and updated airflow that obtains better consistency and shot count.     The rest of the original Wildcat stays perfectly undisturbed. Features include the highly accurate internal air regulator, easy load magazine system, finger print resistant finish on all high-grade aluminum parts, and a fully shrouded barrel. The cocking lever has been perfected to be the smoothest operating sidelever possible with only the highest quality materials used. Forward placement of the lever provides quick and soft cocking of the gun with only the slightest of hand movement away from the trigger.     The Wildcat MKII enhancements continues to solidify its status as the perfectly designed and executed bullpup featuring all the performance and accuracy that has established FX Airguns as the finest airgun manufacturer in the world.

      "text":" Instructions     Typically, there are seven steps involved in upgrading to a newer version of Trac:     1. Bring your server off-line     It is not a good idea to update a running server: the server processes may have parts of the current packages cached in memory, and updating the code will likely trigger internal errors.     Although a database backup will be implicitly created by default when upgrading the environment, it is always a good idea to perform a full backup of the environment using the hotcopy command before beginning.     2. Update the Trac Code     Get the new version as described in TracInstall, or through your operating system package manager.     If you already an earlier version of Trac installed via , it might be easiest to also use to upgrade your Trac installation:     You may also want to remove the pre-existing Trac code by deleting the directory from the Python directory, or remove Trac files from former versions. The location of the site-packages directory depends on the operating system and the location in which Python was installed. However, the following locations are typical:     on Linux:     on Windows:     on MacOSX:     You may also want to remove the directory in which your static resources are deployed. The exact location depends on your platform. This cleanup is not mandatory, but makes it easier to troubleshoot issues later on, as your installation is uncluttered by code or templates from a previous release that is not used anymore. As usual, make a backup before actually removing things.     3. Upgrade the Trac Environment     Environment upgrades are not necessary for minor version releases unless otherwise noted.     After restarting, Trac should show the instances which need a manual upgrade via the automated upgrade scripts to ease the pain. These scripts are run via trac-admin:     This command will not have any effect if the environment is already up-to-date.     Note that a backup of your database will be performed automatically prior to the upgrade. This feature is relatively new for PostgreSQL or MySQL databases, so if it fails, you will have to backup the database manually. Then, to perform the actual upgrade:     4. Update the Trac Documentation     By default, every Trac environment includes a copy of the Trac documentation for the installed version. However, to keep the included documentation in sync with the installed version of Trac, use the following trac-admin command to upgrade the documentation:     Note that this procedure will leave your page intact.     5. Refresh static resources     If you have set up a web server to give out static resources directly (accessed using the URL) then you will need to refresh them using the same command:     This will extract static resources and CGI scripts (, etc) from new Trac version and its plugins into .     Some web browsers (IE, Opera) cache CSS and Javascript files aggressively, so you may need to instruct your users to manually erase the contents of their browser's cache, a forced refreshed () should be enough.     6. Steps specific to a given Trac version     Upgrading from Trac 1.0 to 1.2     Python 2.5 no longer supported     Upgrade Python to at least 2.6 or 2.7, but not 3.0 or greater.     The plugins should be removed when upgrading Trac to 1.2.     New workflow actions     The ticket creation step is controlled with a workflow action. The default workflow has and actions. The action will always be added when upgrading the database. The action will be added if the workflow has an assigned state. You may want to edit your workflow after upgrading the database to customize the actions available on the New Ticket page.     New permissions policy for read-only wiki pages     Since 1.1.2 the read-only attribute of wiki pages is enabled and enforced only when is in the list of active permission policies. If has the default value , then should be automatically appended to the list when upgrading the environment:     If other permission policies are enabled, will need to have appended to the list of active . See TracFineGrainedPermissions#ReadonlyWikiPolicy for additional details on the proper ordering.     Upgrading from Trac 0.12 to Trac 1.0     Python 2.4 no longer supported     Upgrade Python to at least 2.5, but not 3.0.     Obsolete Plugins     Trac has added functionality equivalent to the following plugins:     The plugins should be removed when upgrading Trac to 1.0.     Subversion components not enabled by default for new installations     The Trac components for Subversion support are no longer enabled by default. To enable the svn support, you need to make sure the components are enabled, for example by setting the following in the TracIni:     The upgrade procedure should take care of this and change the TracIni appropriately, unless you already had the svn components explicitly disabled.     Attachments migrated to new location     Another step in the automatic upgrade will change the way the attachments are stored. Create a backup of the directory before upgrading. In case the directory contains some files which are not attachments, the last step of the migration to the new layout will fail: the deletion of the now unused directory can't be done if there are still files and folders in it. You may ignore this error, but better to move them elsewhere and remove the directory manually. The attachments themselves are now all located in your environment below the directory.     Behavior of changed     Prior to 1.0, the owner field of new tickets always defaulted to when the value was not empty. If the value was empty, the owner field defaulted to to the Component's owner. In 1.0 and later, the must be set to to make new tickets default to the Component's owner. This change allows the to be set to an empty value if no default owner is desired.     Upgrading from Trac 0.11 to Trac 0.12     Python 2.3 no longer supported     The minimum supported version of Python is now 2.4.     SQLite v3.x required     SQLite v2.x is no longer supported. If you still use a Trac database of this format, you'll need to convert it to SQLite v3.x first. See \u200bPySqlite#UpgradingSQLitefrom2.xto3.x for details.     \u200bPySqlite 1.1.x is no longer supported. Please install 2.5.5 or later if possible, see Trac database upgrade below.     Obsolete Plugins     Trac has added functionality equivalent to the following plugins:     The plugins should be removed when upgrading Trac to 0.12.     Multiple Repository Support     The latest version includes support for multiple repositories. If you plan to add more repositories to your Trac instance, please refer to TracRepositoryAdmin#Migration.     This may be of interest to users with only one repository, since there is now a way to avoid the potentially costly resync check at every request.     Resynchronize the Trac Environment Against the Source Code Repository     Each Trac environment must be resynchronized against the source code repository in order to avoid errors such as \"\u200bNo changeset ??? in the repository\" while browsing the source through the Trac interface:     Improved repository synchronization     In addition to supporting multiple repositories, there is now a more efficient method for synchronizing Trac and your repositories.     While you can keep the same synchronization as in 0.11 adding the post-commit hook as outlined in TracRepositoryAdmin#Synchronization and TracRepositoryAdmin#ExplicitSync will allow more efficient synchronization and is more or less required for multiple repositories.     Note that if you were using the , you're strongly advised to upgrade it to the new hook documented in the above references and here, as the old hook will not work with anything else than the default repository and even for this case, it won't trigger the appropriate notifications.     Authz permission checking     The authz permission checking has been migrated to a fine-grained permission policy. If you use authz permissions (aka and ), you must add in front of your permission policies in . You must also remove , , and from your global permissions with or the \"Permissions\" admin panel.     Microsecond timestamps     All timestamps in database tables, except the table, have been changed from \"seconds since epoch\" to \"microseconds since epoch\" values. This change should be transparent to most users, except for custom reports. If any of your reports use date\/time columns in calculations (e.g. to pass them to ), you must divide the values retrieved from the database by 1'000'000. Similarly, if a report provides a calculated value to be displayed as a date\/time (i.e. with a column named \"time\", \"datetime\", \"changetime\", \"date\", \"created\" or \"modified\"), you must provide a microsecond timestamp, that is, multiply your previous calculation with 1'000'000.     Upgrading from Trac 0.10 to Trac 0.11     Site Templates and Styles     The templating engine has changed in 0.11 to Genshi, please look at TracInterfaceCustomization for more information.     If you are using custom CSS or modified templates in the directory of the TracEnvironment, you will need to convert them to the Genshi way of doing things. To continue to use your style sheet, follow the instructions at TracInterfaceCustomization#SiteAppearance.     Trac Macros, Plugins     The Trac macros will need to be adapted, as the old-style wiki-macros are not supported anymore due to the drop of \u200bClearSilver and the HDF. They need to be converted to the new-style macros, see WikiMacros. When they are converted to the new style, they need to be placed into the plugins directory instead and not wiki-macros, which is no longer scanned for macros or plugins.     For FCGI\/WSGI\/CGI users     For those who run Trac under the CGI environment, run this command in order to obtain the trac.*gi file:     This will create a deploy directory with the following two subdirectories: and . Then update your Apache configuration file with this new location and location.     Web Admin plugin integrated     If you had the \u200bWebAdmin plugin installed, you can uninstall it as it is part of the Trac code base since 0.11.     New Default Configurable Workflow     When you run , your will be modified to include a section. The workflow configured in this case is the original workflow, so that ticket actions will behave like they did in 0.10:     There are some significant caveats in this, such as accepting a ticket sets it to 'assigned' state, and assigning a ticket sets it to 'new' state. So you will probably want to migrate to \"basic\" workflow; \u200bcontrib\/workflow\/migrate_original_to_basic.py may be helpful. See TracWorkflow for a detailed description of the new basic workflow.     7. Restart the Web Server     If you are not running CGI, reload the new Trac code by restarting your web server.     Known Issues     Customized Templates     Trac supports customization of its Genshi templates by placing copies of the templates in the folder of your environment or in a common location specified in the [inherit] templates_dir configuration setting. If you choose to do so, be aware that you will need to repeat your changes manually on a copy of the new templates when you upgrade to a new release of Trac (even a minor one), as the templates will likely evolve. So keep a diff around.     The preferred way to perform TracInterfaceCustomization is to write a custom plugin doing an appropriate transformation, as this is more robust in case of changes: we usually won't modify element s or change CSS es, and if we have to do so, this will be documented in the \u200bTracDev\/ApiChanges pages.     ZipImportError     Due to internal caching of zipped packages, whenever the content of the packages change on disk, the in-memory zip index will no longer match and you'll get irrecoverable ZipImportError errors. Better anticipate and bring your server down for maintenance before upgrading. See \u200b#7014 for details.     Wiki Upgrade     will not delete or remove default wiki pages that were present in a previous version but are no longer in the new version.     Trac database upgrade     A known issue in some versions of \u200bPySqlite (2.5.2-2.5.4) prevents the trac-admin upgrade script from successfully upgrading the database format. It is advised to use either a newer or older version of the sqlite python bindings to avoid this error. For more details see ticket \u200b#9434.     Parent dir     If you use a Trac parent env configuration and one of the plugins in one child does not work, none of the children will work.     Related topics     Upgrading Python     Upgrading Python to a newer version will require reinstallation of Python packages: Trac itself of course, but also \u200beasy_install, if you've been using that. If you are using Subversion, you'll also need to upgrade the Python bindings for svn.     Windows and Python 2.6     If you've been using CollabNet's Subversion package, you may need to uninstall that in favor of \u200bAlagazam, which has the Python bindings readily available, see \u200bTracSubversion. That package works without tweaking.     Changing Database Backend     The \u200bTracMigratePlugin on \u200btrac-hacks.org has been written to assist in migrating between SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.     Upgrading from older versions of Trac     For upgrades from versions older than Trac 0.10, refer first to \u200bwiki:0.10\/TracUpgrade#SpecificVersions. "

      "text":" Why Can't I Leave You     September 7th 2011, 8 pm Amphitheater II. Gymnasium \/ Platforma 2011 Why Can't I Leave You is: 1. A tense trial about looking for pleasure in dance after a 20 years long dance career. 2. A saga about a disabled, insensitive, empty and detached body. 3. A systematic escape from depression. 4. The performance of the year. 5. A performance about attachment. 6. A confession, of two around 30 years old women, about happiness, sadness, anxiety and quenchless desire for recognition. 7. A comedy about the human existence, that is fragile and meaningless but still worth something. 8. A duet between a woman that won a choreography award and a woman who tends to disappear.     Tina Valentan and Ur\u0161ka Vohar, the authors of the performance entitled Why I Can't Leave You, share nearly identical dance background. They almost simultaneously start dancing at Maribor-based Plesna Izba, and in fourteen years of education and creative work in this dance institute they participated in the same dance classes and performances. They simultaneously left to the acknowledged Amsterdam Dance Academy and nearly at the same time return to Slovenia where they declared themselves dancers, dance teachers and performers. Their constant readdressing of the sense and value of their work often drives them to uncertainty, doubts about their creativity as well as talent and lack of self-confidence. After a few encounters, Tina and Ur\u0161ka realise they have been living in a moderate depressive state for some years and that they find it difficult to enjoy in their work. Thus they decide to engage in a therapeutic process in order to relive that long forgotten pleasure and feeling of happiness. Why I Can't Leave You reflects existential void, the disintegration of language and the lack of harmonious vision of humanity. Avoiding precise definition it portraits the view of the world shocked and depreciated by conflicts and ideologies. The authors don't move in accordance with a definite objective but rather constantly refer to their mode of expression and suppressed mutual dialogue. They talk past one another, without dialectical exchange. The triumph over the tragic inhibition and anxiety is reflected through anti-dance, the ironic attitude towards the society and effort to escape fixation. Despite subtle confessional character as well as aesthetical attitude, the performance provides a rather substantial dose of self-irony and therefore a shift from self pity. Indeed, the authors directed the composition to the postmodern choreography processes, such as deconstruction, parody, irony, pleasure and hyperreality.

      "text":" 1280pxThe Metelkova mesto Autonomous Cultural Zone joins many urban cultural activities and is a stop on numerous tours. Photo: \u017diga Kranjec, 2008     The Autonomous Cultural Centre Metelkova mesto (AKC Metelkova mesto, AKC Metelkova or just Metelkova \u2013 also Meta, Metka, or Metla in the local slang) is an umbrella term for one of the liveliest cultural, artistic, social and intellectual urban areas in Ljubljana that stands among the largest agglomerations throughout Europe of alternative and underground cultures.     AKC Metelkova mesto je krovno ime za eno najbolj \u017eivahnih kulturnih, umetni\u0161kih, dru\u017ebenih in intelektualnih urbanih obmo\u010dij v Ljubljani - in \u0161ir\u0161e.     History     AKC Metelkova mesto occupies the former \"Fourth of July Military Barracks\" at Metelkova ulica 3 in the centre of Ljubljana, which was originally commissioned by the Austro-Hungarian army in 1882 and completed in 1911. From the end of WWI until 1941, it was used by the army of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (previously the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes); during WWII, it was occupied firstly by the Italian fascist then German Nazi forces; then from 1945 until late June 1991, the area was in the hands of the People's Army of Yugoslavia (JLA). Its neighbouring IXth Army District Headquarters on Metelkova ulica is nowadays known as the \"museum district\", the legal property of the Ministry of Culture, located nearby.     In 1990, the Network for Metelkova was formed, consisting of more than 200 partner organisations facilitated by the Movement for the Culture of Peace and Non Violence and the \u0160KUC Association, to propose a new, peaceful and creative use for the barracks. In 1991, the Network for Metelkova formally petitioned the newly-independent Slovene government to take possession of the abandoned site. The municipality of Ljubljana gave some promises that the area would be given to the alternative culture, but in reality, nothing happened.     After months of waiting, direct action took place. During the night from 10 to 11 September 1993, a group of about 200 alternative producers and activists occupied the former military barracks in order to prevent its illegal destruction and redevelopment, and since 1995, the space has been a self-organised autonomous zone. Although it has not yet succeeded in achieving proper legal status, the area was partly registered as national cultural heritage in 2005.     Projects at Metelkova mesto are often supported by the state and municipal funders as well as by many local and international sponsors, foreign embassies and cultural institutes. In spite of this, Metelkova mesto is still regularly under attack: in 2006, one of the buildings which was considered to have been erected illegally was torn down and various inspections continue to interrupt cultural events.     Venues, organisations     Many cultural organisations are based at Metelkova, with some of them there since the start and others of a more transient nature. They include: KUD Mre\u017ea Arts and Culture Association, currently running the Alkatraz Gallery, the Asylum Studio, the Night Window Display Gallery Pe\u0161ak and its International Feminist and Queer Festival Red Dawns; KAPA Association for Cultural and Artistic Production with its Gala hala venue for all genres of rock, dub, hip-hop, and so on; KUD Anarhiv with its \u0160kratova \u010ditalnica; Celica Hostel, with its cafe-bar, concert and gallery space (run by KUD Sestava), constructed within the old military prison; and Infoshop, a social space for research and development in the theory and practice of anarchistic and related movements.     Venues also include Klub Menza pri koritu, with a programme spanning from poetry readings to rock gigs, Klub Channel Zero for electronic music, dub, and variety of rock and hard core events, Klub Gromka for alternative performing arts events, films, various concerts, literature, and lectures, the gay club Klub Tiffany and the lesbian club Klub Monokel, as well as Klub SOT 24,5, run by the YHD \u2013 Association for Theory and Culture of Handicap. There are also Mizzart Gallery with its psy trance fiestas, and \u2013 as the only spontaneously-erected building \u2013 Jalla Jalla artistic inn. Several artists' studios \u2013 some of which are also available for visiting artists \u2013 are located in one or the other of barracks. The outdoor events are usually held at the \"Square with no Historic Memory\". Open only throughout the summer, the garden of Gala hala offers a special summer programme in an extremely nice courtyard that can host up to 800 people.     The building at Metelkova 6 accommodates the offices of many Ljubljana NGO cultural organisations, including SCCA-Ljubljana Centre for Contemporary Arts, the Peace Institute, Maska Institute, Forum Ljubljana, City of Women, Ekran magazine and Strip Core, as well as numerous other cultural, research and civil society organisations.     Metelkova is nowadays organised non-hierarchically, with its Forum (of all participants) making decisions using consensus and direct democratic principles.     Programme     {{{description}}}     Metelkova mesto is one of the two locations in the city (the other being a newer squat called Tovarna Rog), and one of the few in the country, where youth, underground and alternative cultural expression is systematically produced and presented to a large and active audience. It is also a forum of impressive intellectual irradiation. Up until recently, the Klub Gromka annually hosted the programme of the Workers' Punk University (now the Institute for Labour Studies) where the most urgent and actual dilemmas of the contemporary world were discussed by competent international speakers. The annual celebration of the AKC Metelkova's perseverance takes place each September in the form of a festival.     Projects     Producers from Metelkova have participated in numerous important cultural festivals including the Wiener Festwochen, documenta, Manifesta, the Sao Paolo Biennial and the Venice Biennale. Many Slovene international festivals held in Ljubljana hold part of their activities at Metelkova, including the City of Women International Festival of Contemporary Arts, Druga Godba Festival, MENT Ljubljana, Ljubljana Jazz Festival and the Ana Desetnica.     Media-wise, Radio \u0160tudent (R\u0160) is with no doubt Metelkova's strongest comrade-in-arms, and it also organises its Radio \u0160tudent Benefit Festival at one of Metelkova's venues.     International cooperation     The major reconstruction works were executed in 2001 and 2004 in collaboration with the Axt und Kelle collective of travelling young craftsmen and craftswomen from Germany, Denmark and Switzerland. Metelkova mesto used to be a member of Trans Europe Halles and in 2006 it hosted the annual meeting of its members.     Metelkova has been presented as an outstanding phenomenon by the international media, including ARD, Arte, BBC, Die Zeit, Falter, Feral Tribune, Los Angeles Times, ORF, Russian State TV, Seattle Times, NY Times, The Guardian and ZDF.

      "text":" Doc. dr. Jurij Gorjanc, specialist in general and abdominal surgery, president of the Slovenian Hernia Association     Prof. dr. Slavko Rakovec, dr. med., spec. spl. kirurgije (MD, specialist in general surgery), founding and honorary president of the Slovenian Hernia Association     Asist. Toma\u017e Jakomin, dr. med., spec. spl. kirurgije (MD, specialist in general surgery), secretary of the Slovenian Hernia Association     SHORT HISTORY OF THE SLOVENIAN HERNIA SECTION (2004-2010), prof.Slavko Rakovec     In 2004, prof. Slavko Rakovec from the Surgical Clinic in Ljubljana invited all surgical departments in Slovenian hospitals to send their representatives to the inaugural meeting of the Hernia Section of the Slovenian Association of Surgeons. At that time, prof. Rakovec was the surgeon with the most experiences in modern treatment of inguinal hernias. In 1994, he travelled to Los Angeles to study the Lichtenstein tension-free repair and in the same year, he was the first surgeon in Slovenia to introduce this procedure in his institution. In 1995, he visited Udine to learn the tension-free seamless repair which he also introduced into his practice. In the same year, he reported at the 2nd Congress of Endoscopic Surgery of Slovenia in Ljubljana and at the 1st International Symposium of Croatian and Slovenian Surgeons in \u010cakovec, he reported (with C. Triller) on his experience with both procedures. In 1996, he presented a broader casuistry at the 3rd Congress of Endoscopic Surgery of Slovenia. In 1997, he modified the mesh-plug procedure according to his rich experience and described this new method at the 32nd post-graduate course in surgery for general practitioners. He presented (with L. Pleskovi\u010d) the advantages of tension-free hernioplasty at the 4th Congress of Endoscopic Surgery of Slovenia in Portoro\u017e. In 1998 and 1999, he held lectures and performed demonstrations at surgical workshops and symposia on hernias, hosted by the Slovenian Association of Surgeons in Ljubljana. In 1998, he lectured on modern hernioplasty in elderly patients at the 2nd Congress of the Slovenian Association of Surgeons in Maribor. In the same year, Rakovec presented his modification of the tension-free seamless hernioplasty at the 16th World Congress of CICD (Collegium Internationale Chirurgiae Digestivae) in Madrid and at the 31st World Congress of ICS (International College of Surgeons) in Buenos Aires. In 1999, he reported about his experiences at the 21st Congress of EHS (European Hernia Society) in Madrid. In 2000, Rakovec presented his modification at the 32nd World Congress of ICS in Singapore and at the 17th World Congress of International Society of Digestive Surgery (ISDS) in Hamburg. In 2001, he appeared at the 4th International Congress on Ambulatory Surgery and presented a large series of executed ambulatory hernioplasties (with P. Ko\u0161orok and B. Mlakar). In 2002, he published an article (with B. Mlakar) in Zdravni\u0161ki vestnik (Slovenian medical journal) on his method and his experience with it. In the same year, he (and his colleagues) held 3 lectures on treatment of inguinal hernia by various methods at the 3rd Congress of Slovenian Association of Surgeons. He also lectured on hernioplasty at the 18th World Congress of ISDS in Hong Kong and in 2004, at the 34th World Congress of ICS in Quito (Ecuador). In the late 20th and early 21st century many Slovenian surgeons started using different tension-free procedures in treatment of hernias. More and more physicians became interested in this topic and a need arouse to establish a forum where they could exchange experiences, opinions and viewpoints. The initiative to establish a hernia section was well received and the inaugural meeting in spring 2004 at the Dr. Peter Dr\u017eaj Hospital in Ljubljana was attended by representatives from almost every surgical department in Slovenia. After an extensive and constructive discussion, the Hernia Section of the Slovenian Association of Surgeons was established. The present physicians elected a management board and its chairman (prof. Rakovec). T. Pevec from the hospital in Ptuj took over the organization of the first symposium. In autumn of the same year, a hernia meeting took place in Ptuj, entitled Professional Symposium at the 130th Anniversary of the Dr. Jo\u017ee Potr\u010d General Hospital. This meeting was very successful as the participants discussed significant and valuable content. The organizers issued a proceeding with all the contributions and the chairman of the section reported on the symposium in Zdravni\u0161ki vestnik (Slovenian medical journal). Activities at home and abroad continued with the same pace. In 2005, Rakovec and Triller lectured at the 1st Congress of Herniology of Serbia and Montenegro in Ni\u0161ka Banja and the chairman attended the 27th Congress of in Turin. In 2006, the 4th Congress of the Slovenian Association of Surgeons took place in Nova Gorica and one session was granted to the Hernia Section. Lectures and discussions contributed to creating meaningful future steps in hernioplasty. In 2007, the chairman (also in his role as representative of the Slovenian Association of Surgeons within the Mediterranean Hernia Society) appeared at the 29th International Congress of EHS in Athens and at the 7th Congress of the Croatian Association for Digestive Surgery in Opatija. For easier organization of the section's professional meetings and mainly due to international connections, the chairman made an agreement with the representatives of the Slovenian Association of Surgeons on a consensual independence of the section in 2007. Nevertheless, they preserved close contacts and agreed to provide one session for the Hernia Section at each congress of the Slovenian Association of Surgeons. The Hernia Section thus became independent within the Slovenian Medical Association (SZD). It can only use its title Slovenian Hernia Society for its activities abroad. In 2007 and 2008, the chairman participated as lecturer and surgery demonstrator at three international workshops in hernias that were organized by the European Training Centre in Ljubljana. In 2008, the chairman addressed the 30th Congress of EHS in Seville with a discussion on the sensible choice of hernioplasty processes. In the same year, his colleagues from Slovenj Gradec (Jurij Gorjanc) organized the 3rd Slovenian symposium and workshop on hernias with international participants. This represents an important contribution to the progress of herniology in Slovenia. One of the lecturers was prof. dr. Michael Alexander that presented the Shouldice hernioplasty. A proceeding of the contributions was released and the chairman (with Jurij Gorjanc) published a report on the symposium in Zdravni\u0161ki vestnik. In 2009, the chairman participated at the joint meeting of the American (AHS) and European (EHS) Hernia Societies in Berlin. He presented a report on his experience as he performed more than 2000 hernioplasties using his modification of the tension-free repair. In the same year, he was invited to present his modification in Pleven (Bulgaria) as lecturer and demonstrator. In 2010, the 5th Congress of the Slovenian Association of Surgeons took place in Kranjska gora. It was attended by international participants. As usual, one session was provided to the Hernia Section. Its chairman held the opening speech and described the previous successful (and partly unsuccessful) operation of the Slovenian Hernia Section. He also held a lecture on the results of more than 2000 operations he performed using his procedure. At the end of the professional program, there was an organizational meeting. Due to retirement, the chairman retreated from his function. He suggested Jurij Gorjanc as his successor and his proposal was adopted unanimously and by acclamation. In 2012, they organized the 5th Slovenian symposium and workshop on hernias with international participation. The honorary chairman participated by commenting during surgery demonstrations and by giving a lecture on the development of herniology in Slovenia. "

      "text":" Abstract     Paracetamol overdose results in an accumulation of the reactive, hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimin (NAPKQI) which can cause serious liver injury. Recognition of paracetamol overdose, hepatotoxicity risk estimation and early treatment are crutial in paracetamol poisoniong management. In ingestion of potential hepatotoxic dose of paracetamol decontamination and early treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are indicated. Both, 20-hours intravenous and 72-hurs oral regimes of NAC administration are successful. By antidote regime selection we should consider patient condition and time after paracetamol overdose. In severe hepatotoxicity, criteria for liver transplantation should be regularly evaluated and mechanisms for liver transplantation must be activated in time.

      "text":" How to create a convincing r\u00e9sum\u00e9     An excellent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is the first step to achieving the career change you want. However it should be noted that HR managers receive numerous job applications every day and only spend a few moments looking at each one. If your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 does not grab their attention in those first few moments, where they can quickly see your relevant experiences, expertise and skills, it is likely that your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will be archived and stay there.     Below we have presented some useful tips on how to create a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that will stand out in the eyes of employers and guarantee you access to the best job positions.     1. Stick to the point!     An employer want to know exactly what you can do for their company, that is why you have to focus on your professional expertise, skills and especially any special achievements in your career that may be interesting for your employer or correspond to any of the requirements of the job position. Stick to the point! The best r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is one that is tailored to each employer. Avoid giving irrelevant information to the employer.     2. Say who you are straight away     Besides the standard topics such as:     Personal contact information (e-mail and mobile phone are required),     An overview of relevant work experience,     Formal and informal education, and     A description of expertise, professional and personal skills,     your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should include your profile right at the start. This is a sort of summary of your career with a punchy title in which you present your unique value to the employer in three to four sentences; what are your key features and qualifications and how you see your career path developing.     3. Consistency demonstrates your professionalism     A modern r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should not be longer than two A4 pages, should be logically structured, easy to read and nicely designed. Consistency throughout the document demonstrates your professionalism, so make sure you clearly define each section, use lists with markers and stay consistent with the use of font, spacing between lines, symbols and colours. Emphasise keywords with bold type and be especially careful that the text does not contain grammatical and spelling errors.     4. Build on your personal brand     A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is a tool that you can use to promote your personal brand in the eyes of an employer. In addition to having an excellent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter, your web presence (active participation in professional associations, conferences, writing articles or a blog, as well as a well-made profile on social media such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter) can significantly benefit your image as seen by an employer. The majority of employers look online to find relevant information about a candidat "

      "text":" HelpOnProcessingInstructions     MoinMoin processing instructions have the same semantics as in XML: they control the paths taken when processing a page. Processing Instructions (PIs) are lines that start with a \"#\" character followed by a keyword and optionally some arguments; the keyword is always handled case-insensitive. Two consecutive hash marks at the start of a line are a comment that won't appear in the processed page.     All PIs must appear at the very start of a page. An exception are comment PIs, those may appear anywhere within a page using \"wiki\" format, but not in pages using other formats.     For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing.     Any other installed parser name. See HelpOnParsers for additional parsers available and ParserMarket for user provided parsers.     Some parsers can accept optional arguments. Check the documentation of the parser for the possible options.     #redirect     #refresh     Redirect to a different page (or an external URL or just refresh the same page, if left out)     Needs to be enabled in the server configuration, see HelpOnConfiguration     target can be either a page name, or a fully qualified url. Here are two examples:     #pragma     Sets processing modes for this page:     Mode names are not case-sensitive.     MoinMoin knows few pragmas, and you may add more and use them for your own themes or macros. Here are the known pragmas:     section-numbers     Switches automatic numbering of section headers.     off or 0 disable numbering, on or 1 enables numbering. The default mode is set by the show_section_numbers config option.     When enabling numbering, its possible to use specific heading level:     Only displays section numbers for headings of level 2 and up (similarly for 3 to 6).     keywords     adds a <meta> tag with keywords which tells search engines what you can find on the particular page.     description     adds a <meta> tag which contains the description of the particular page.     supplementation     is used to enable or disable a supplementation for the current page e.g. a discussion page     off disables the supplementation for the current page. See also HelpOnConfiguration\/SupplementationPage for more.     #deprecated     Mark this page as deprecated.     Further changes to the page will create no backup versions and using it will cause the current revision to show along with the revision previous to the deprecation. This allows you to remove all of the page's content, insert #deprecated, and then write a short message explaining the reason behind this action. By doing this you are effectively freezing the last version of the page and reducing its rank in search results, but you are keeping the content available for viewing.     Removing the PI from the page will store no backup of the deprecation warning.     In comparison to #REDIRECT this PI gives the ability to give the user a reason why this page is no longer of use and why they should go to a new one, while #REDIRECT will throw them to the new page without any reason.     Not removing the page's content when adding #deprecated will cause the page to render twice.     #language     Set page language and direction.     Set page language and direction. Language name is the iso-639-1 code. MoinMoin ignore languages that does not have a translation file in MoinMoin\/i18n\/. See also HelpOnLanguages. "

During the assessment process of possible locations, cooperation with local authorities is required. Locations should be checked against the sustainable mobility and logistics plans of the concerning city. Test and deploy new delivery methods (such as e-cargo bikes) in at least 3 cities\/project. Optimise urban space, loads and reduce empty miles through dynamic routing, load policies, multi\/single-brand parcel lockers and boxes. Demonstration of cost-efficient, zero-emission modes of last mile transport for urban and peri-urban deliveries in the living labs involved in the projects (as listed in the scope part below). Increased quality and liveability of urban and metropolitan areas by reducing road risk, congestion, air and noise pollution. Improve knowledge of user needs, habits and preferences in terms of deliveries by collecting and sharing information amongst public authorities and private companies aiming at clustering users while respecting GPDR. Scope: The large scale introduction and application of cargo bikes, in urban and peri-urban areas has shown to be a game changer for cities: the image of cycling improves; general levels of cycling increase (both for freight and passengers); urban space is used more efficiently; air quality, noise and safety levels as well as quality of life improve. However, this innovative solution is present in only a few cities and at best in the starting phase in other European cities. Its full potential has not been achieved in any European city.     Projects should address both methodological and technical\/vehicle aspects to help optimising last mile deliveries, where the benefits and how it can be replicated across several cities.     Demonstration of cleaner modes for last mile transport vehicles such as, electric assisted cycles (2\/3\/4 wheels), bikes and cargo bikes in combination with the testing of innovative tools such as dynamic e-routing, load policies, multi\/single-brand parcel lockers and boxes, micro consolidation centres and zero emission freight in the urban context to measure their effects on optimisation (reducing empty miles), efficiency, and congestion reduction should be considered. Results could also contribute to better delivery technologies transforming the last mile such as camera-based object tracking, precise location brought by enhanced EU satellite navigation (GNSS) services, application of AI technologies and CCAM solutions to delivery services and advanced analysis based on driver apps. It is recommended the establishment of energy savings objectives (e.g. electricity) regarding micro-consolidation centres in relation to other traditional strategies.     Actions should focus on piloting cooperation with private logistics operators, local businesses and establish new models for addressing governance and management of logistics operations in urban and peri-urban areas. Projects should achieve cost-efficient and scale up potential and deployment of innovative and sustainable urban people and goods mobility solutions enabled by better governance and regulations, including procurement or white-label schemes as an efficient tool for achieving these goals.     A thorough evaluation, with a clear baseline in each city, should provide qualitative and quantitative information on the results of the local solutions implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed measures in achieving local policy objectives should be evaluated and the possible barriers to their broad take up and deployment identified, together with recommendations on how to overcome them. This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the CIVITAS Initiative.     Proposals may include preparatory, take up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools to support local planning and policy making.     A demonstrated contribution to the implementation of the cities Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans, without forgetting higher scales planning scope, is expected. If not already in place, the city can develop a Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan or other appropriate planning instrument to manage urban freight and logistics.     Funding for major infrastructure works is not covered by this action. Proposals should plan for an active collaboration within the CIVITAS initiative.     Social innovations should be considered, notably as new tools, ideas and methods leading to active citizen engagement and as drivers of social change, social ownership, and new social practices.     This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities     Cross-cutting Priorities: Social Innovation Societal Engagement Socio-economic science and humanities     [1]At least three living lab cities should be included as demonstrators of the innovative solutions and at least three follower cities. At least one of the living labs and follower cities should be located in areas experiencing rapid economic and social change.     POGOJI SODELOVANJA     General conditions     1.

      "text":" Open-air museum of Hayracks     The Land of Hayracks is the first open-air museum of hayracks. It consists of 19 different drying structures originating from the Mirna Valley, except for one hayrack which comes from the vicinity of Ivan\u010dna Gorica. The museum\u2019s purpose is to show the development of hayracks through time, space and social meaning from simple drying structures to complex forms of double hayracks \u2013 \u201ctoplars\u201d.     A hayrack is a structure for drying crops standing independently or leaning against another outbuilding. Most frequently made of wood, a hayrack is situated at the homestead or separately on the field or meadow. Grains, hay, corn, flax, hemp, legumes, cuttings of tuberous plants and fern were dried and stored in it. A double hayrack is a particularly suitable place for storing tools, agricultural machinery and wagons as well as other building material and modern vehicles.     Hayracks present a centuries-long achievement of agricultural and livestock activities on country, castle and monastic agricultural estates. They reflect an extraordinary sense of using natural materials and mastery of carpenter\u2019s tradition. Mainly in the Slovenian ethnic territory, hayracks evolved into several types and distinctive shapes which cannot be found elsewhere in the world. That is why the hayrack has become one of the most recognisable features of Slovenia. The Land of Hayracks attempts to emphasise as well as to present its cultural value and encourage people to preserve their hayracks.     The open-air museum consists of all six existing types of hayracks in the Slovenian ethnic territory: three single (single, single cloaked, single stretched) and three double hayracks (low, \u201cgoat\u201d hayrack, linked hayrack \u2013 \u201ctoplar\u201d). The museum covers an area of 2.5 ha and comprises 1 km of paths suitable for walks. The oldest hayrack in the museum is called \u00bbLuka\u2019s toplar\u00ab dating back to 1795, which is also one of the world\u2019s oldest preserved double hayracks. "

The emphasis is on its dependence on tourist demand and supply as well as on changing economic, social and political circumstances. The author points to the gradual loss of Roga\u0161ka Slatina's leading role among Slovene health resorts. The second section deals with the demographic, economic and spatial development of the settlement. Since Roga\u0161ka Slatina is a multi-functional tourist resort, the emphasis is on the impact of the health resort and tourist provisions as well as industry on the development and structure of work posts, the dynamics of population growth and the economic structure of the population and households. The attitudes of the local population toward health resort-related activities and tourism and the significance of tourist infrastructure for their quality of life are also analyzed. "

Thus, the roots of descendants of this respectable lady intertwine the soil of a large part of the globe. By the end of 2020, endorsed by an official certificate, they planted 228grafts on four continents and in 29 countries.     The Bestowal of Scions     The granting of scions is a significant ceremonial event that takes place during the Pruning of the Old Vine event. At that time, the city vintner does his most important professional job in the vineyard. The correct pruning has a direct impact on the growth of the vine and the grape harvest. On this occasion, Maribor and the Old Vine are honoured by several invited guests, townspeople, representatives from wine orders and fraternities as well as wine queens among others; this makes for those visiting a very colourful and interesting party.

There is more than enough space and opportunities for everyone.     Rules for Navigating the River:     Our goal is to ensure everyone can use the river safely and enjoyably. We can only attain this by diligently following the rules written in the Ordinance Determining the Navigating Regime on the So\u010da and Koritnica Rivers.     The So\u010da River may be navigated from 15 March to 31 October from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.     All activities conducted either in, on or by the So\u010da River are undertaken at your own risk.

Access to the river is allowed only at specifically marked entry and exit points.     In order to use the entry and exit points, the user must have a valid permit.     Camping outside the dedicated campsites is not allowed.     Useful Tips:     The So\u010da is a cold Alpine river with a steep gradient and a significant level of difficulty in some places. It can prove perilous for inexperienced visitors, which is why we recommend the following:     Please check that you are acquainted with the dangerous sections and areas where navigation is strictly forbidden. Please consider whether you know the river and its characteristics well enough and do not underestimate them.     Make sure you are acquainted with all the urgent information necessary for safely navigating the river.     Please consider whether you are sufficiently qualified to navigate the So\u010da River and do not overestimate your capabilities. We recommend you hire qualified and experienced local guides.     Make sure you carefully check the safety and adequacy of your craft. Only venture onto the river with all the necessary equipment.     Think about your safety and the safety of others.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

      "text":" The comparison of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0     Abstract     Today we can't imagine our lifes without the Internet. When we are faced with some kind of a problem, there is always a first association of finding a solution on the Internet. This idea has enabled us Web 2.0 development. Today, as we seek informations, we can search for solutions even for a couple of hours. Therefore, allows Web 3.0 standard users particular fast and efficient search solutions on the Internet and computer understanding of human speech, in order for the serch to be more effective. In this thesis I turned to the interpretation of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 standards and their mutual cooperation. First, I showed how the search engines of the period of Web 2.0 work and what is the plan of working for a period of Web 3.0. Then I turned to the technologies of these two standards, which enable a lot with working together. RDFa and microformats are two of the most common ways for embedding semantics into web documents. Web 2.0 uses the read write web, blogs, web applications, rich media, viral media, tagging or Folksonomy while sharing content and focusing on communities. The Web 3.0 standard uses semantic web, drag n drop mash ups, widgets, user behavior or Me-onomy, advertisement, user engagement, consolidates dynamic content and focuses on individuals. The proposed expansion of the web 3.0 technology includes the following: - Mobile devices, Ubiquitous connectivity, mobile internet access with broadband adoption. - Open technologies, open data formats & data license, open API\u2019s and protocols. - Open identity, open reputation, personal data and roaming portable identity. - Intelligent web technologies, semantic techniques like OWL, RDF, SPARQL, SWRL, and statement based data stores with semantic application platforms. - Intelligent applications, machine learning, autonomous agents, machine reasoning and natural language processing.     Item Type:     Thesis (EngD thesis)     Keywords:     Web 2.0, Web 3.0, web technologies, search engines, microformats, RDFa, metadata, integration "

      "text":" Development Processes     Although application development can take many forms, this manual proposes a fairly generic process for creating web applications using Tomcat. The following sections highlight the commands and tasks that you, as the developer of the code, will perform. The same basic approach works when you have multiple programmers involved, as long as you have an appropriate source code control system and internal team rules about who is working on what parts of the application at any given time.     The task descriptions below assume that you will be using CVS for source code control, and that you have already configured access to the appropriate CVS repository. Instructions for doing this are beyond the scope of this manual. If you are using a different source code control environment, you will need to figure out the corresponding commands for your system.     One-Time Setup of Ant and Tomcat for Development     In order to take advantage of the special Ant tasks that interact with the Manager web application, you need to perform the following tasks once (no matter how many web applications you plan to develop).     Configure the Ant custom tasks. The implementation code for the Ant custom tasks is in a JAR file named , which must be copied in to the directory of your Ant installation.     Define one or more Tomcat users. The Manager web application runs under a security constraint that requires a user to be logged in, and have the security role assigned to him or her. How such users are defined depends on which Realm you have configured in Tomcat's file -- see the Realm Configuration HOW-TO for more information. You may define any number of users (with any username and password that you like) with the role.     Create Project Source Code Directory     The first step is to create a new project source directory, and customize the and files you will be using. The directory structure is described in the previous section, or you can use the sample application as a starting point.     Create your project source directory, and define it within your CVS repository. This might be done by a series of commands like this, where is the name under which your project should be stored in the CVS repository, and {username} is your login username:     Now, to verify that it was created correctly in CVS, we will perform a checkout of the new project:     Next, you will need to create and check in an initial version of the script to be used for development. For getting started quickly and easily, base your on the basic build.xml file, included with this manual, or code it from scratch.     Until you perform the CVS commit, your changes are local to your own development directory. Committing makes those changes visible to other developers on your team that are sharing the same CVS repository.     The next step is to customize the Ant properties that are named in the script. This is done by creating a file named in your project's top-level directory. The supported properties are listed in the comments inside the sample script. At a minimum, you will generally need to define the property defining where Tomcat is installed, and the manager application username and password. You might end up with something like this:     In general, you will not want to check the file in to the CVS repository, because it is unique to each developer's environment.     Now, create the initial version of the web application deployment descriptor. You can base on the basic web.xml file, or code it from scratch.     Note that this is only an example web.xml file. The full definition of the deployment descriptor file is in the Servlet Specification.     Edit Source Code and Pages     The edit\/build\/test tasks will generally be your most common activities during development and maintenance. The following general principles apply. As described in Source Organization, newly created source files should be located in the appropriate subdirectory, under your project source directory.     Whenever you wish to refresh your development directory to reflect the work performed by other developers, you will ask CVS to do it for you:     To create a new file, go to the appropriate directory, create the file, and register it with CVS. When you are satisfied with it's contents (after building and testing is successful), commit the new file to the repository. For example, to create a new JSP page:     Java source code that is defined in packages must be organized in a directory hierarchy (under the src\/ subdirectory) that matches the package names. For example, a Java class named should be stored in file . Whenever you create a new subdirectory, don't forget to register it with CVS.     To edit an existing source file, you will generally just start editing and testing, then commit the changed file when everything works. Although CVS can be configured to required you to \"check out\" or \"lock\" a file you are going to be modifying, this is generally not used.     Build the Web Application     When you are ready to compile the application, issue the following commands (generally, you will want a shell window open that is set to the project source directory, so that only the last command is needed):     The Ant tool will be execute the default \"compile\" target in your file, which will compile any new or updated Java code. If this is the first time you compile after a \"build clean\", it will cause everything to be recompiled.     To force the recompilation of your entire application, do this instead:     This is a very good habit immediately before checking in changes, to make sure that you have not introduced any subtle problems that Javac's conditional checking did not catch.     Test Your Web Application     To test your application, you will want to install it under Tomcat. The quickest way to do that is to use the custom Ant tasks that are included in the sample script. Using these commands might follow a pattern like this:     Start Tomcat if needed. If Tomcat is not already running, you will need to start it in the usual way.     Compile your application. Use the command (or just , since this is the default). Make sure that there are no compilation errors.     Install the application. Use the command. This tells Tomcat to immediately start running your app on the context path defined in the build property. Tomcat does NOT have to be restarted for this to take effect.     Test the application. Using your browser or other testing tools, test the functionality of your application.     Modify and rebuild as needed. As you discover that changes are required, make those changes in the original source files, not in the output build directory, and re-issue the command. This ensures that your changes will be available to be saved (via ) later on -- the output build directory is deleted and recreated as necessary.     Reload the application. Tomcat will recognize changes in JSP pages automatically, but it will continue to use the old versions of any servlet or JavaBean classes until the application is reloaded. You can trigger this by executing the command.     Remove the application when you are done. When you are through working on this application, you can remove it from live execution by running the command.     Do not forget to commit your changes to the source code repository when you have completed your testing!     Creating a Release     When you are through adding new functionality, and you've tested everything (you DO test, don't you :-), it is time to create the distributable version of your web application that can be deployed on the production server. The following general steps are required:     Issue the command from the project source directory, to rebuild everything from scratch one last time.     Use the command to create an identifier for all of the source files utilized to create this release. This allows you to reliably reconstruct a release (from sources) at a later time.     Issue the command to create a distributable web application archive (WAR) file, as well as a JAR file containing the corresponding source code.     Package the contents of the directory using the tar or zip utility, according to the standard release procedures used by your organization.

Our goal is moderate growth, in particular in terms of increasing the added value and expanding our production, but in a manageable way. We wish to independently master projects and to ensure to our customers only the highest quality and the agreed delivery due terms.     As highlighted, our goal is expanding our production facilities. To this end, in 2013 we purchased approx. 7.500 m2 of building land on which in 2014 we have started the construction of three manufacturing facilities, namely:     Assembly hall of approx. 1.600 m2 surface and a warehouse intended for the composition and testing of technological equipment supplied to our customers     Hall intended for blasting all kinds of materials and painting in conditions that comply with the highest standards     Hall intended for cutting materials by means of plasma, waterjet, laser, etc.     The investment in these facilities is expected to be completed in 2015. Hence, quality management of undertaken production process, from cutting to assembly of major projects. Above all, there will be no more need for improvisation; the working conditions of all employees as well as the company's productivity and thus our competitiveness in the global market will be improved. Parallel with this investment, in order to gain greater competitive advantage in the manufacture of the most demanding equipment we have purchased a modern machine tool, i.e. 5-axis combined turning-milling machine centre OKUMA VTM-1200YB for workpieces up to \u00d81200 x 1000 mm.     Up to now, we have invested a substantial portion of the profits in facilities and machinery. Now, it is necessary to invest it in particular in the development and expertise due to price wars in the global market. Our future is in developing own tech products manufactured by means of our modern technological equipment.

IMPORTANT NOTICE     Dear patients,     With the phasing-out of measures at the national level and the order of the Ministry of Health on temporary measures in the field of health care in view of containment and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, Community Health Centre Ljubljana has gradually begun increasing the scope of available health care services. Given the current epidemiological situation, from the point of view of safety of patients and medical staff alike, caution is still required, as well as the use of personal protective equipment and taking all the measures necessary to prevent corona virus infection.     Check-up with a GP and all other activities at the Community Health Centre Ljubljana are only possible after a prior appointment and consultation with the medical staff (over the phone or via e-mail). Your GP will assess your medical condition and reach a professional decision about any necessary treatment. The assessment can be made via e-mail, over the phone, or directly through a medical check-up.     If you have symptoms and show signs of COVID-19, your GP will refer you over the phone for swab testing and\/or a check-up at a COVID clinic, therefore never visit the health centre unannounced.     In the event of a life-threatening condition, call 112 immediately.     For your scheduled appointment, please arrive at the health centre no more than 5 minutes before the appointment.     At the entrance to the health centre, disinfect your hands and put on a surgical mask; wear the mask at all times for the duration of your visit.     Please observe a personal safety distance of at least 1.5 metres in all areas of the health centre.     On the day before your check-up, you should receive a call from the medical staff, who will check your medical and epidemiological condition by means of a questionnaire. It is advisable to print out and fill in the Questionnaire for the assessment of medical condition before treatment in the outpatient clinic at home, and bring it with you for your scheduled appointment.     Only healthy persons should come for a check-up. If a person falls ill, we kindly ask them to inform us of the fact and so waive their appointment time to somebody else.     ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES (PRESCRIPTIONS, SICK LEAVE ...)     All administrative services, such as issuing prescriptions for chronic therapy, referrals for check-ups, orders for medical devices, at the discretion of the GP possibly also sick leave, are performed remotely over the phone or, most preferably, by e-mail. When contacting us via e-mail, please state your name and surname, date of birth, Health Insurance Card number and the telephone number where you can be reached.     ENTERING THE HEALTH CENTRE     With the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the population, entering the Community Health Centre Ljubljana is limited and runs exclusively through the triage point. We ask all patients entering the health centre to provide the nurse with ACCURATE and TRUE information about their health condition, possible visits to high-risk areas and any close contact with infected persons. Providing untrue information means endangering one\u2019s own health and everyone else\u2019s.     WEEKENDS, PUBLIC HOLIDAYS AND NIGHT-TIME     On weekends, public holidays and at night, the paediatric emergency first-aid service (PNMP) and adult emergency first-aid service (SNMP) run in an unchanged manner. In case of symptoms suspected of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, cold, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting), make an appointment over the phone and do not visit the emergency service unannounced.     Before seeking emergency medical help, consider whether a check-up is necessary or whether you can wait for the workday to call your personal or a substitute practitioner.

      "text":" To\u010dka osi, Dinamike prostorov, 2016-2018     predstava     To\u010dka osi, Trilogija Dinamike prostorov, 2016-2018 Gostovanje v Kranju Stolp \u0160krlovec \u010cetrtek, 29.11., ob 20.00 To\u010dka osi raziskuje dinami\u010dno izmenjavo med risbo in gibom, pri \u010demer je v ospredju proces nastajanja, vzpostavljanja odnosa pred kon\u010dnim produktom. Projekt je zasnovan kot spreminjajo\u010de se okolje, v katerem biva telo. Vizualni in kinesteti\u010dni proces sta osredoto\u010dena na linijo in relacije telesa do ustvarjanja pomena. Izhodi\u0161\u010de narisanih, projeciranih in izsekanih kiparskih tvorb so risbe iz serije Neverending (P. Maher, 2010, arhivsko \u010drnilo na papirju), kjer se kiparsko telo oblikuje iz neprekinjene linije. Navidezno gibanje linij in neenakomerno nagibanje te\u017ee okoli to\u010dke osi ter odmikanje od le-te izoblikuje volumen nakopi\u010denega, izrisanega materiala. Zdi se, da je risba gibljiva in vedno se spreminjajo\u010da, kot telo performerja. Padanje je osnovno izhodi\u0161\u010de gibanja, saj je vztrajanje prisotno v repeticiji nihanja telesa. Ples je postavljen v galerijski prostor, da lahko z gledalci deli isto ravnino. Gibalna instalacija se med drugim ukvarja s pomenom pojma horizontalnosti, s katerim je Pollock osvobodil umetnost vezano na platno in spravil v pogon performersko zasnovano umetnost. Horizontalnost je, kot je zapisal Walter Benjamin, ravnina, ki vsebuje znake, vertikalnost pa je ravnina reprezentacije in vsebuje objekte. Raziskovanje horizontalnosti znotraj preseka plesne in vizualne umetnosti sre\u010damo tudi v nekaterih delih Trishe Brown, ki bodo referen\u010dni material za delo. To\u010dka osi o\u017eivlja in posodablja vpra\u0161anje odnosa telesa v gibanju do figuralike, teme, pomena in njegovega pojavljanja v reprezentacijskem prostoru. Soo\u010da se z vpra\u0161anji, kako ustvariti prostor, brez da bi ozna\u010dil teritorij, in ustvariti dogodek izven politike kolonializma. To\u010dka osi pre\u010di razmerje med \u017eenskim in mo\u0161kim principom, vztrajanjem in minevanjem. Padajo\u010de telo, v dialogu z gravitacijo upogiba linearno perspektivo, in s svojo konstantno akcijo ustvarja vizualno-kineti\u010dno, t.i. ugodje v nelagodju, ki ga pri gledalcu spro\u017ei ob\u010dutek nihanja. koncept: Tina Valentan, Polona Maher koreografija, ples: Tina Valentan oblikovanje prostora: Polona Maher dramaturgija: Barbara Novakovi\u010d Kolenc oblikovanje svetlobe: Jaka \u0160imenc oblikovanje zvoka: Gal \u0160krjanec Skaberne fotografija: Nada \u017dgank produkcija: Muzeum Ljubljana koprodukcija: Muzej in galerije mesta Ljubljana in Layerjeva hi\u0161a, Kranj V sodelovanju z Narodnim domom, Maribor.

The project is designed as a changing environment in which the body is located. The visual and kinaesthetic processes are focused on the line and the relations of the body towards creation of meaning. The outset for the drawn, projected and carved sculptures are actually the drawings from the \"Neverending\" series (Polona Maher, 2010, archival ink on paper), where the sculptural body develops from an unbroken line. The volume of the accumulated drawn material has been formed through seeming movement of the lines and the uneven inclination of the weight around the pivot point and the distancing from it. The drawing seems to be moving and always changing, like the body of the performer. Falling is the basic starting point of the movement, since the perseverance is present in the repetition of the body swing. Dance is placed in the gallery space so that it can share the same plain with the viewer. The moving installation, among other things, deals with the notion of the horizontal that enabled Pollock to liberate the art of the upright canvas and introduce instead the performance-based art. The horizon, as Walter Benjamin wrote, is a flatland that contains signs, while the vertical is a plain of representation that contains objects. The research of the horizontal within the intersection of dance and visual arts is encountered also in some works by Trisha Brown that will make some reference material for the work. The Pivot Point of the axis revives and updates the question of the relation of the body in motion towards figuration, theme, meaning and its occurrence in the representation space. He is confronted with the questions about how to create a space without having to designate a territory, and how to create an event outside the politics of colonialism. The Pivot Point traverse the relationship between the female and male principles, perseverance and passing by. The falling body, in dialogue with gravity, bends the linear perspective, creating through its constant action visual-kinetic comfort in the discomfort that is caused in the viewer through the feeling of a swing\/pendulum. concept: Tina Valentan, Polona Maher coreography, dance: Tina Valentan scenography: Polona Maher dramaturgy: Barbara Novakovi\u010d Kolenc light design: Jaka \u0160imenc sound design: Gal \u0160krjanec Skaberne photography: Nada \u017dgank production: Muzeum Ljubljana co-production: Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana and Layer's House Kranj in collaboration with: Narodni dom Maribor, Culture and Event Center TINA VALENTAN (1978) graduated in her studies of dance and choreography at the School for New Dance Development in Amsterdam in 2007.

      "text":" INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE | The non-aligned contemporaneity?     27 and 28 May 2019 | auditorium of the Museum of Modern Art     Conference will be dedicated to the question how to harness the historical visions of the non-alignment movement (NAM) in the light of the current global geopolitical situation. Another important question will tackle the legacy of culture in the spirit of NAM's internationalism and its potentials for the present day.     Naturally, these questions should not be considered as part of some kind of exoticism linked to the past, nor should they harbor nostalgia for the movement itself, for as we know, what many NAM states actually practiced was quite far from the principles the movement promoted. From today's perspective, the concepts of nation-states, identity politics, and exclusive national cultures, which appeared in the cultural political agendas of the time, can be seen as highly problematic. The concept of solidarity also needs to be treated with caution: with whom are we solidary, and how are we solidary? How can we avoid the \u201cwhite savior complex\u201d? And what should be done with the fact that Syria, Pakistan, Libya and most African states are still members of the NAM?     Nevertheless, the movement should not be forgotten in so far as it envisioned forms of politics that took as their starting point peoples and societies that had been forcibly relegated to the margins of the global economic, political and cultural system. The movement also proposed new models that \u201cenabled people to live and not merely to survive\u201d (Svetlana Alexievitch). The struggle against poverty, inequality, and colonialism in the world system, coupled with trans-national solidarity could be useful in a reconsideration of the history and legacies of the NAM today, at a time when colonialism has yet again become more than evident.     However, to truly reconsider the legacy of the NAM in the cultural framework of today more radical measures would need to be considered \u2013 not only on the declarative level, but on practical, applicative levels: on the level of governance, knowledge production and heritage. Next, it would be necessary to translate these new formats and concepts into the spaces of policymaking, not only into those of art and culture, but also in relation to the state, national welfare, and the mechanisms of public administration.     These are some of the topics planned for discussion at the conference.

With the goal of transcending political borders; providing a \u201cgeneral education with specialization;\u201d and creating a universally recognized diploma, the first United World College, Atlantic College, was founded. Atlantic College served as a model for the framework of the IBDP, and soon thereafter, other United World Colleges were founded all over the world - with the IBDP as their central curriculum - and the programme began being adopted by high schools as well. Harlan Hanson, one of the IBDP\u2019s founders, stated that the goal of the IB Diploma was to, \u201cprovide an internationally acceptable university admissions qualification suitable for the growing mobile population of young people whose parents were part of the world of diplomacy, international and multi-national organizations.\u201d     The unique structure of the curriculum     More important than the IBDP\u2019s unique international recognition and esteem among educators and universities is how the curriculum is actually structured and how the students work within the programme. In an intense two-year period, students take six subjects, of which a minimum of three must be taken at the higher level (HL) and the rest at the standard level (SL). In this regard, students concentrate on and receive specialization in subjects far beyond what they would be able to do in normal high school classes. In addition, unique to the IBDP are the three additional requirements for students to obtain the diploma: Extended Essay (EE), which is a 4000 word independent research essay, which is completed in one of the six subjects; Theory of Knowledge (TOK), which is a class dedicated to the understanding of how one obtains and processes knowledge, and includes a final essay and presentation; and lastly, Creativity, Action, Service (CAS), which stresses community and social service and physical activity as means to grow and mature as an individual and productive member of society.     The IB learner profile     With the IBDP requirements in mind, it\u2019s worth noting what kind of student is most suitable for enrollment in this program. On the surface, of course an exemplary academic record and proven ability to handle a large academic workload are necessary. But the IB learner\u2019s profile stresses above all open-minded thinking and inquiry; reflection and communication; intellectual, emotional, and physical balance; and the ability to take risks, but also defend one\u2019s beliefs and principles. Howard Gardner of Harvard University summed up these ideas by saying that IB students \u201cthink critically, synthesize knowledge, reflect on their own thought processes and get their feet wet in interdisciplinary thinking.\u201d     Gimnazija Kranj on board     Gimnazija Kranj was approved for the IBDP by an international committee in 2009, and began with the first IBDP class in the fall of 2010. On a weekly basis, the IBDP students engage in social projects in and around the community of Kranj for their CAS requirements, and work independently with faculty mentors on their EEs. The school is excited about how quickly the programme has taken off, and how enthusiastically the students and teachers have embraced these new learning and teaching efforts.     Syllabus The IB Diploma Programme is a two-year course. Students can choose six subjects from six groups. At least three or four subjects must be taken at higher HL and the rest at standard SL level.     Mother Tangue - Slovene     Group 2: Language B     English, German, French, Spanish     Mathematics     Subject chosen from groups 2, 3 or 4. We don't offer the Arts.

Sun Care Set     Disponibilitate: Indisponibil     Categorie:     To achieve optimum results while sunbathing, bronzed skin without burning, minimal wrinkles and a reduction in the risk of skin diseases, we recommend buying the ESSENS Sun Care Set, which includes:     1x Before Sun Care Tablets 1x Before Sun Care Gel 1x Sun Care SPF 30 1x Sun Care SPF 50 1x After Sun Care Milk 1x ESSENS Sun Care bag     The recommended use of ESSENS Sun Care is as follows:     1. Begin using your first ESSENS Sun Care Tablets 3 days before vacation departure. Take one pill, 3 times a day, after main meals. Finish your remaining tablets during the holiday. These tablets were developed to complement the human body with raw materials that produce brown pigment, accelerate tanning and help the skin remain more tanned and glossy. The unique composition also has a positive effect on the immune system, which may be weakened by excessive exposure to the sun.     2. Prior to the application of our sunscreen, apply our Before Sun Care Gel to your skin. This creates a base for our sunscreen to sit upon ensuring it holds very well and is easily spreadable, further assisting in even protection with the help of UV filters. This gel additionally contains substances which stimulate the skin to produce more vitamin D and melanin - brown pigment.     3. Approximately 15 minutes after applying ESSENS Before Sun Care Gel, it is a good time to apply either ESSENS Sun Care SPF 30 or ESSENS Sun Care SPF 50 to the skin. The protection factor is usually selected according to the skin type and intensity of sunlight, to which it will be exposed. ESSENS Sun Care sunscreens include effective protection against both UVA and UVB rays and contain substances to assist in the accelerated browning of the skin.     4. After sunbathing, apply our ESSENS After Sun Care Milk, which is used for skin regeneration. It reduces redness and adds that much-needed hydration, thereby prolonging your tan.

      "text":" Since 1992 the office of the British Council Slovenia has been engaging widely in one form or another in the Slovene educational, social, and cultural scene through its cooperation with governmental and non-governmental institutions, ministries, and independent programmers.     Today the Art programme of the BC Slovenia is dedicated to Creative and Cultural Economy in order to present the best of British creative talent in Slovenia and create partnerships, sharing the UK's expertise and experience in the creative industries and develop leadership, professional networks and skills.     British Council Slovenia delivers high quality internationally recognised examinations and provides expertise and training opportunities for teachers, policy makers and learners.     Contents     Background of cultural cooperation     The programme of the British Council Slovenia has changed significantly. At the very beginning, the original focus was to develop a wider knowledge of the English language, however, quite soon these efforts resulted in high-quality teaching being offered by local schools of English. Gradually an ongoing cooperation with local cultural producers was developed with an aim to present British arts and culture to Slovene audiences.     A multimedia site-specific installation Map to Paradise from Ljubljana by Peter Greenaway was co-produced in cooperation with Muzeum Institute in 2000 and the exhibition From the Cradle To the Grave \u2013 Selected Drawings by Damien Hirst was on view at the International Centre of Graphic Arts, Ljubljana in 2003. The internationally established festivals in Slovenia Mladi levi Festival, Exodos Festival, Druga Godba Festival, Ljubljana International Film Festival (LIFFe) and the City of Women Festival brought numerous British artists to Slovenia with the British Council's support.     British Council Slovenia has also initiated programmes such as Animating Literature that hosted British authors Diran Adebayo, John McRae, and Donald McLaughlin, amongst others, and an anthology of contemporary British short stories, translated into Slovenian through a cooperative project with the \u0160tudentska zalo\u017eba Publishing House. From 2002 through 2008 the BC office in Slovenia collaborated with the UK agency Visiting Arts and the Ministry of Culture on the Slovenia Cultural Profile project (website and book).     Creative industries     In 2004 the first workshops relating to new approaches to cultural infrastructure and the creative industries (\"Modernising Heritage, City Revitalisation, Fashion, Design\") were organised with Slovene partners. Since 2005 Slovenia has participated in the annual Young Creative Entrepreneur (YCE) programme awards competitions, focusing on Design (2005), Publishing (2006), Screen (2007), and Fashion (2012). Slovenes have been nominated as finalists several times, with young entrepreneurs being rewarded with a tour of the relevant UK industry, where they have met with key people from the trade.     In April 2012 the British Council Slovenia with Adria Media co-organised a spring edition of Philips Fashion Week at Kino \u0160i\u0161ka Centre for Urban Culture. Fashion designer and filmmaker Kathryn Ferguson talked about the topic of fashion films and held a lecture. In the Ljubljana Fashion Week 2013 guest was British fashion designer Jane Bowler.     Education and society     On behalf of the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the British Council in the period 2004\u20132007 managed the annual Chevening and Valvasor-Chevening Scholarships co-funded by the Slovene Ministry of Culture. Scholarships covered 3\u201312 months of postgraduate study in the UK related to commercial management of culture and cultural heritage, management of cultural tourism, audio-visual and media industry, specialised technical professions, and performing arts and film production. A dozen of today's most successful cultural managers, gallery owners, and producers got their vital education in the UK.     The British Council Slovenia has also run various science-based programmes (including the Network Research Programme) in partnership with the Slovene Research Agency (ARRS).     Today in Education they focus on bringing an international dimension to education and raise educational standards through sharing the UK's expertise and encouraging the best international students to study in the UK.     The focus on Social Entrepreneurship tackles Europe\u2019s current economic and social challenges, especially among the young unemployed and disadvantaged populations.     English language     The British Council in Ljubljana supports English language learning by offering and administrating several UK examinations \u2013 for example, the IELTS (International English Language Testing System) and the Cambridge English suite of examinations on a regular basis. They have introduced also an English test for business \u2013 Aptis.

      "text":" Preschool Nutrition     We offer our preschool children well-balanced nutrition in accordance with the standards and norms for the nutrition of preschool children, guidelines for healthy eating, the general practice of menu preparation in educational institutions, and instructions and recommendations of relevant external professional institutions. We prepare the menus within the Nutrition Commission, of which the members are: Heads of the two central kitchens, two pedagogical workers, and the Nutrition and medical hygiene regime organizer.     The menus include various foods from all food groups. The menu is uniform for all children and is only partially adjusted for the youngest children \u2013 for children up to the age of 2 years (food consistency, certain foods are less suitable for their age \u2013 e.g. meat products...). Weekly menus are regularly displayed on notice boards for parents and can also be viewed on the website of the kindergarten.     We prepare daily fresh dishes. We mainly use basic ingredients and do not use pre-prepared products. We use only natural spices without artificial additives, we bake desserts ourselves and often prepare home-made fruit, vegetable, and other types of spreads. Several times a week, we offer bread without any additives, and about once a month also organic milk. We try to use as many organic ingredients as possible, unfortunately, this is not yet always possible due to our financial situation. We believe that in the future, progress will be made in this area as well.     We are aware of the fact that healthy diet habits acquired in childhood are important for the entire life. That is why we are trying to make them attractive to children by regularly including such contents in our education programme.     NUTRITION REGIME     Preschool nutrition is unified, different diet is only offered to children with special nutrition requirements. In such cases, the parents must provide the preschool teacher with the appropriate medical certificate of the child's physician \u2013 a paediatrician or an allergy specialist. The certificate must include all the necessary information to allow the preschool to provide the child with adequate dietary nutrition (a type of diet, prohibited foods, allowed foods, appropriate substitutes, etc.).     We do not offer any other form of alternative nutrition or special forms of diet for religious or other reasons since spatial, personnel and other relevant conditions do not allow us to do so. In addition, the opinion of the public health professionals is that children require mixed nutrition for their growth and development and that various alternative forms of nutrition can not meet the nutritional needs of the child and are unacceptable during this period.

      "text":" Locking against concurrent editing     If two people try and edit the same wiki page at once some nasty conflicts can occur. Without any kind of warning system one of the editors can save the page, which leaves the other editor with a message warning them about the conflict. An easy way around this is to display warnings for editors that try to start editing wiki pages that are already being edited. i.e. the wiki keeps track of pages being edited.     This can be done in Moin using the editlock system. There are three levels of locking: to warn, to lock and None (turned off).     If you configure Moin to warn, when someone tries to edit a page that is already being edited, they will be presented with a warning message asking them to consider waiting until the current editor has finished.     Moin can also be configured to lock an edited page, only during editing. Here, if some tries to edit a page that is being edited they will receive a message saying that the page is locked and will not be able to edit it until the editor has finished.     A complication of this feature is that an editing session might be started and might not be finished. e.g.:     Someone presses edit and then clicks on a link to exit the page without cancelling.     The browser window is closed without cancelling.     The back button is pressed.     Someone starts editing a page and forgets and leaves it open overnight.     This would result in a page having permanent warnings or being permanently locked. Therefore, both warn and lock have a timeout feature. After a specified number of minutes the feature expires. Note that the timer restarts when you hit preview. If you are actively editing a page and hit preview it is assumed you are still busy and the timer starts again. If you leave the page, or exit it for more time than the timer allows the edit locking runs out and other people are free to edit the page.     Configuration     The edit_locking config variable controls the behaviour of the locking system. This can have the following values:     None, i.e. there is no edit locking. The feature is turned off and nobody is warned or stopped from doing simultaneous edits of a page.     \"warn <timeout>\" tells Moin to warn anyone trying to concurrently editing a page, with a specified timeout, e.g. \"warn 10\" will warn for 10 minutes after an edit is started.     \"lock <timeout>\" tells Moin to lock a page for the specified amount of time after an edit started. e.g. \"lock 5\" locks a page for 5 minutes.     Aborting an edit     For the reasons explained in the timeout description above, you should always use Cancel to cancel an edit if you have enabled edit locking!     Example     Sample interaction of JohnMiller and JaneDoe...     no locking (None)     JohnMiller starts editing a page and JaneDoe thinks she'll edit the same page. She has no idea that someone else is editing the page so they both edit away and hit save. It doesn't matter who started first and did the most editing, whoever hits save changes first will have their changes committed and the unfortunate 2nd editor will have to try and merge their changes in or lose them.     edit warnings (warn)     JohnMiller starts editing a page and JaneDoe thinks she'll edit the same page. When she hits edit she'll see a warning telling her that someone else got there first. If she is polite she'll leave the page, but she can still save before John and he may lose his changes.     edit locking (lock)     JohnMiller starts editing a page and JaneDoe thinks she'll edit the same page. When she hits edit she'll see a warning telling her that someone else got there first and the page is locked. She will have to wait for the page to become available. "

The struggle to recognize the homeland is simultaneously a struggle for self-recognition, an attempt to put oneself and one\u2019s world in the proper place, to reconcile oneself with one\u2019s past, to arrange a relationship with the other and the self, and then to live one\u2019s present to the fullest [\u2026].\u201d     ISBN: 978-961-6547-79-6     About the author     The writer, playwright and essayist Zorko Sim\u010di\u010d was born in 1921 in Maribor, where he attended teachers\u2019 college. After the occupation in 1941 he successfully completed his studies in Ljubljana. He left Slovenia on 3 May 1945, moving to Austrian Carinthia and then to Italy. In 1948 he emigrated to Argentina, becoming one of the central figures of Slovenian cultural life there. He was a co-founder of a Slovenian cultural campaign and for twelve years was the editor of Meddobje, one of the most important emigrant cultural magazines. He returned to his homeland in 1994, after Slovenia\u2019s independence. Sim\u010di\u010d has established himself as one of the most important contemporary Slovenian literary artists; for his life work he received he received, among other prizes, the Pre\u0161eren Prize in 2013. He is a full member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.     more     About the translator     Marjeta Drobni\u010d (photo: Juan Martin)     Marjeta Drobni\u010d     Marjeta Drobni\u010d is a freelancer who translates from Spanish into Slovene and vice versa.

Renishaw is an experienced supplier of integrated Raman-AFM solutions, having offered them for over 16 years. The latest addition to the range of instruments it supports is Bruker's Dimension Icon AFM. This additional pairing demonstrates the extreme flexibility of the Renishaw inVia confocal microscope, and its ability to interface to a wide range of instruments employing many analytical techniques.     inVia-Icon is a fully integrated Raman-AFM system. It has a comprehensive range of features, making it the highest performing, yet easy-to-use, system for co-localised Raman-AFM measurements. It supports a full range of AFM techniques and \u00b5-Raman capabilities, and can characterise the properties of materials at sub-micrometre and nanometre scales.     The Dimension Icon provides users with uncompromised performance, robustness, and the flexibility to perform nearly every AFM measurement type, at resolutions previously only obtained by extensively customized systems. The inVia microscope complements this by producing both rich, detailed, chemical images and highly specific Raman data from discrete points. Users can make both Raman and AFM measurements without moving their samples between instruments and without compromising performance. In addition, if necessary, both instruments can be used independently.     The inVia-Icon combination has a flexible arm linking the two instruments; this couples light between the two with mirrors, providing a higher efficiency than fibre optic coupling. This ensures users can acquire high quality data in the minimum time, with market-leading signal-to-noise levels.     The flexible coupling arm employs Renishaw's StreamHR high resolution mapping technology. It can Raman map areas up to 500 \u00b5m \u00d7 500 \u00b5m, with position encoders ensuring 100 nm repeatability. Bruker's proprietary PeakForce QNM complements StreamLineHR by providing even higher resolution nano-mechanical information.     \u201cRenishaw's patented sampling arm allows the sample to be measured while it is still mounted on the AFM; making correlated measurements with both systems is easy,\u201d said Tim Batten, Renishaw Applications Scientist. He added, \u201cThe arm does not contact the AFM and, as such, does not affect its performance.\u201d     Adding inVia's powerful chemical imaging capabilities to the Bruker Dimension Icon sets a new standard, delivering high-performance surface characterisation with both efficiency and ease.     For an up-to-date listing of the AFM\/SPM models that can be coupled with an inVia, contact your local Renishaw office.

We recognize him as a pioneer of Slovenian comics and one of most successful artists in the field of comic books and cartoons \/ animated movies on European scale. He spent his last years in Center for elderly people Notranje Gorice, where he passed away in 2018, 92 years old.     Miki Muster in the construction of the statue     He started his comic book career already in student years, since he was deeply impressed by seeing animation movie as a child: \u201cI remember; we still lived in Krmelj, and I was maybe seven years old, when we went to the cinema in Ljubljana. Before movie there saw a cartoon \u2013 some devils burning fire and jumping around. That was my first encounter with animation movie, and it stayed forever in my memory,\u201d remembers Muster.     When Muster started to draw, only Disney was known as a reference. Muster got in touch with his works already as a child. One day he watched his cartoon and after that, all of his thoughts were united to recreate something similar. He explains it by himself: \u201cI think, that was in 1938, when I wasn\u2019t even 13 yet. In Ljubljana they played animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I was poisoned. I could dream only about, how I could also create animated movies. Every piece of paper, all borders of school notebooks were drawn with dwarfs.\u201d     This is how he discovered Disney\u2019s style and soon mastered it. However, Muster did not copy, he would just take his viewpoint on how characters should feel. He thinks about it so: \u201cThe magic of Disney\u2019s characters is that they are not human. He would humanize objects and animals and give them appealing shape. This is why they are more popular than realistic human figures, despite the fact, they are being drawn. He gave animals human personality, for each person he would find animal, that represents his character. A human can identify himself easier with an animal. We know that from childhood years.\u201d     President Borut Pahor awarded Silver Order for merit for top-notch pioneering work in the field of Slovenian animated film and comics, 13th February 2014     Muster\u2019s drawing has become more mature with years. The personality of his heroes became more defined and got new shapes. He graduated from sculpture, but he was always interested in comic books. He always wanted to study animation movie, but had no chance for that. The closest to animation movie was study of sculpture.     \u201cFor a cartoon you need a feeling for a third dimension and sculpture is study of motion, where three dimensions apply. The character rotates in such way, that it has to be captured from all sides.\u201d     Also during sculpture study, the thought for an animated movie didn\u2019t give him a break. \u201cBecause there was no sufficient literature at that time, as well nobody in Europe worked on it, I had no one to advise me or teach me something. Therefore, I went experimenting myself. Years and years of hard labour were needed to yield some results. I had to discover things all myself, as well there was no materials at that time, we wouldn\u2019t even have paper.\u201d     Gradually he gained clear recognition. At his crafting he changed feather pen for a brush, with which he gained flexibility and by comic book needed softness. Everyone who saw his drawings, comic book or drawing book, knew immediately \u2013 that is Miki Muster.     When I was a child, I dreamed of entertaining children, generations of children. And I think I\u2019ve made it. I have one wish: if you have unfulfilled childhood dreams, my wish is for them to come true, like mine did.     First character that Miki brought to life was definitely Zvitorepec (Trickster). He was drawing The adventures of Trickster without interruption for the whole 25 years. \u201cI tried to create Slovenian comic. I searched for a hero from our fairy tales. In them, the most common animal is female cunning fox, and I turned it to male fox Trickster, my hero.\u201d Later other who heroes Lakotnik (Hungerly) and Trdonja (Hardie) joined as well. This unforgettable trinity becomes the central happening in all of Muster\u2019s stories, which were 40 altogether.     Muster during swimming     At the same time, Miki Muster has worked also on animation movie. Exactly this Trickster was the first hero, which made his first two, three steps with the help of his pencil. After first trials there were also first orders for animation movies. Among firsts was the company Viba film from Ljubljana, which ordered many 30-minute movies. These movies were: Pu\u0161\u010dica (The Arrow), Zimska zgodba (Winter Story) and Kurir Nej\u010dek (Courier Nejchek). From the year 1967 Muster dedicated his time entirely to television cartoon movies \u2013 commercials. Such pioneer work Muster remembers this way: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know sound synchronisation at that time and we broadcasted speech, music, sound effects live on air. In sound recording studio, we had a crowd with anchor guy, me with a tape recorder and props, with which I created noise and other sounds, plus some other people. Drawn commercial was short and sometimes taped together from more than fifty pieces of film. We were lucky, because film never tore apart at the live screening. There was a lot of enthusiasm, inertia and happiness.\u201d     This way around 380 animated commercials were produced in the years between 1967 \u2013 1990, among most popular were Cik Cak bunnies, \u0160umi (candies Visoki C), retail store Mercator, Kolinska (Viki krema, \u010cunga Lunga), Podravka (Medolino and soups), Medex (honey), Fructal double A, Dana and Jelovica (Ne bo vam uspelo \/ You won\u2019t make it). Beside this, he worked also for other regular clients, such as Elan (ski equipment), Aero (chemical shop), Emo (pots), Termika and others.     The wish for research and creation of real featured animation movie brought him abroad, where he started working on animation series in the year 1973 as independent artist at Bavaria Film in Munich. When he met, in the middle of 70\u2032, Guillermo Mordillo, humourist and caricaturist, a series of 400 animated movies was produced with a total length of almost 300 minutes. This series had tremendous success and was played all over the world. Muster\u2019s \u2013 Mordillo\u2019s cartoons were bought by television studios from thirty countries, but despite that, you will be searching Muster\u2019s name in credits for nothing, because Mordillo as character designer, and Manfred Schmidt as producer, took all the credits. With similar success Muster animated movies of Nick Knatterton, based on same named comic book of Manfred Schmidt.     His 80th birthday is spent with its heroes \u2013 exhibition at the Post of Slovenia     Miki Muster worked in Germany until 1990. In that time he created over 600 minutes of animation movie. Mordillo series (300 minutes), series of 21 shorts Oma bitte kommen (105 minutes), series about detective Nick Knatterton (200 minutes) and Knax series for children about saving money (20 minutes), made for Deutsche Sparkasse. \u201cTogether, in this time, I have created for over ten hours of animated movies, which is on average around seven seconds per day. I worked everything myself. From scripts, animations, copying and painting backgrounds. Only coloring and recording was done by somebody else. Next to that, I drew from five to ten animated commercials each year for RTV Ljubljana, I drew also some comics for the German clients.\u201d     The drawing books, that Miki Muster drew after adopted stories of the world well-known artists, partially after original stories of Slovenian writers (one of them he wrote himself), were published around ten years as feuilleton in daily newspaper Slovenski poro\u010devalec (Slovenian Reporter) from 1955 on. Some of them were later once or twice printed in book version.     Apart from all of this, of course, the comic stories were created, that Miki Muster wrote and drew in the period from 1952 \u2013 1973, when he was employed as a journalist for the Slovenian Reporter, at the newspaper company TT (Tedenska tribuna\/Weekly Tribune). They were published in the first post-war illustrated Slovene weekly newspaper PPP (Polet\u2019s images and tales), which began to emerge in 1952, as well in the TT newspaper.     All stories were reprinted at least once. For the first time as individual stories as notebooks, then as collected works in eight books, which ranged from 200 to 470 pages, the next time as an anniversary edition of the author\u2019s 80th anniversary of birth, this time the only time in A4 format and the last time as a complete and chronologically arranged collection of eleven books. In the sixties, several stories were reprinted by the Trieste\u2019s Novi list, some of Maribor\u2019s Ve\u010der, and some by Dolenjski list. Translations were also prepared in Hungarian, German, Italian and Croatian, but were not successful in the market.     Miki Muster, the best and the most successful Slovenian author of comics and animated movies, did not receive many awards for his work in the past because he never participated in special \u201cofficial\u201d meetings of illustrator associations and he was always a lonely horseman who was creating away from others. In 1978, the Yugoslav Association of Ninth Art Club established the Andrija Maurovi\u0107 Prize for comics achievements. The first one was received by Miki Muster for his life work. At the ceremony they wrote: \u201cMIKI MUSTER, as the most outstanding Slovenian author of graphic literature, as an author who, in the Disney\u2019s tradition of caricaturistic animal comics, created unique quality achievements especially in the earlier period, from which the type of comics, both in terms of drawing integrity and after scriptwriting, between the foundations of the Slovene and Yugoslav comics, and at the same time one of the classics of the European ninth art.\u201d In 2000 Miki Muster received an Academy award called Viktor for his life achievements and work, and the Municipality of Ljubljana awarded him in 2003 with the recognition of the city of Ljubljana. In 2014, the President of the State awarded him with a Silver Order as a merit for top pioneering work in the field of Slovene animated movies and comics.     In 2015 Pre\u0161eren Fund awarded to Miki Muster the Pre\u0161eren Prize for Lifetime Achievement. After taking the prize, he was short, as he said, he said everything: \u201cWhen I was a child, I dreamed of entertaining children, generations of children. And I think I\u2019ve made it. I have one wish: if you have unfulfilled childhood dreams, my wish is for them to come true, like mine did.\u201d "

      "text":" Location     Report from the congress 2010     A scientific congress The youth sport 2010 was held at the Faculty of sport in Ljubljana between December 2nd and 4th 2010. The patron of the symposium was the President of the Republic of Slovenia Mr. Danilo T\u00fcrk. The title topics of the symposium were:     Youth lifestyles and sport: health promotion through sports and PE, leisure sports, fitness (and fatness) of children and youth, the role of media, sports facilities, playgrounds.     Trends in PE teaching: teacher training, dealing with motivation and behavioural problems in PE, PE and sport for children with disabilities, classroom management, curriculum. development, teaching methods, PE in the educational systems, the pedagogies in PE, planning, evaluation and assessment of PE, involvement of parents in PE and youth sports.     Coaching, training and testing of young sportspeople: working with sports talented children, sports, ethics and fair play, psychological aspects of youth sports.     Medical aspects of youth sport: injuries in PE and youth sports, nutrition of young sportspeople, obesity, diabetes and sports, asthma and sport, excuses from PE, cooperation between PE teachers and physicians.     Anomalisms in youth sports: sports bets, frauds, PE, youth sports and social exclusion, adaptations of rules, doping, overtraining.     Statistics and analyses in PE and youth sports.     The congress showed that there is an urgent need to make a qualitative step forward in physical education and youth sport at large. Our environment has changed and it is professionally unacceptable to ignore the changes and proceed with the old practices which do not work in the new environment.     The goal of physical education should be to develop physically educated students but this goal can only be achieved by changing our learning environment, opening doors to information and communication technology and by making use of the modern diagnostic technology in research of PE and youth sport.     This, however, does not mean that we have to abandon the concepts of PE we know but that we have to change it, or to merely to start implementing the already accepted criteria of quality and efficient PE and youth sport:     to provide at least moderate-intensity sporting physical activities of at least 60 to 90 per day to all children and youth     to include vigorous and very vigorous activities at least 3 times a week, including activities that strengthen muscles and bones     more emphasis should be put on aerobic activities, which should make up the majority of daily physical activity, and outdoor resources should be used as often as possible to complement the quality work in sport gyms     PE should not be considered as tool for reduction of obesity epidemics but should function as an important part of wider public effort to deal with one of the greatest present and future health-threat     PE teacher education institution should produce competent specialist who are able to educate physically literate persons     quality PE and competent PE teaching should be provided to children from the first years of schooling in the form of joint teaching of PE specialist teachers and generalist classroom teachers and also the preschool children should have the opportunity to develop fundamental movement patterns     PE curriculums should be balanced and should equally focus on physical fitness and health issues     social inequalities in youth sport should not be reflected on the children\u2019s physical and motor development and the appropriate measures from responsible authorities should be introduced to make physical activities available to all     top sport could be used to attract children into organised sport programmes and leisure sporting activities but active participation instead of top result should be the goal of youth sport     extra care should be taken for children with disabilities to include them as an physically active part of society on recreational and competitive level     since children can cope with fatigue different than adults this should be acknowledged and children and youth physical activity should include also high-intensity intermittent activities to improve their aerobic and anaerobic fitness     at the end school should provide children with information about the exercises for good posture, which could be implemented during school breaks and adapted furniture should be introduced in schools to provide a long-term solution.     gallery     card     Privacy settings     Our website uses \u201ccookies\u201d to distinguish between visitors and to perform website use statistics.

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Analysis of compensation of banks and savings banks for payment services - 2017     02\/15\/2018 \/ Press release     The Bank of Slovenia has once again drawn up its annual Analysis of fees charged by banks and savings banks for payment services, and calculation of the costs of payment service baskets (hereinafter: the analysis), for the ninth consecutive year, covering 12 banks and three savings banks.     The analysis allows payment service users (individual consumers and legal entities) to compare the fees that they are charged for specific payment services by payment service providers, and the calculated costs of payment service baskets (on an annual basis), thereby making it simpler to choose the most suitable or cheapest payment service providers (with regard to their payment habits and the size of their payments). By publishing the fees, the Bank of Slovenia aims to help payment service users in making an informed decision in choosing a payment service provider, but it cannot directly influence the level of fees (this is the domain of the individual payment service providers).     Of the total of 21 payment service segments analysed, the average fees as at 31 December 2017 were up on 31 December 2016 in 12 segments, down in six segments, and unchanged in three segments. The largest increase (of 28.57%) was recorded by the average fee for external payments by standing order for individual consumers, which can at least be partly attributed to the redirection of payment service users to a more cost-effective alternative (e.g. direct debits), while there was a decline (of 3.85%) in the average fee for managing a current account for individual consumers.     Payment service users can also compare payment service providers on the basis of the costs that the particular provider would charge for providing payment services. The annual charge differs with regard to the payment service provider\u2019s business methods, i.e. whether the client uses a bank teller for payment (a traditional client) or electronic banking (an e-client).     Costs of payment service baskets of cheapest and most expensive payment service providers     By 31 October 2018 Slovenian payment service users (individual consumers) will also be able to compare (certain) fees at the EU level, through the creation of comparison websites in Member States (in Slovenia: at the Bank of Slovenia), in accordance with the Directive on the comparability of fees related to payment accounts, payment account switching and access to payment accounts with basic features, which was transposed into Slovenian law by the new Payment Services and Systems Act. The improved transparency of fees at the EU level will make it easier for payment service users to choose between more than 4,000 payment service providers in the EU, irrespective of country of origin.

      "text":" Archive of past issues of the Journal for critique of science     Metelkova     (\u010cKZ No. 253 - 3\/4 2013)     pp. 12\u201320 by Jasna Babi\u0107     Metelkova mon amour: Reflections on the (Non-)Culture of Squatting     In some circles in Slovenia the name Autonomous Cultural Center Metelkova City is considered to be almost a synonym of squatting. Although Metelkova was not the first public squat, it definitely remains the oldest of those still around. Drawing comparisons with the international squatting movement, the squatter community in Metelkova is analyzed on different levels: to what extent it nurtures the culture of squatting, and what was and remains the role that Metelkova plays in a wider Slovenian context in terms of developing and sustaining the squatting culture. The article ends with the conclusion that the squatter movement in Metelkova (and elsewhere in Slovenia) has so far failed to fully develop, nurture and maintain strict guidelines and principles, and that this can be attributed to the lack of squatting tradition, the large number of people involved in the project, and the internal division among them on the legalization issue.     Keywords: squatting, direct political action, community, temporary autonomous zone, Metelkova City     Jasna Babi\u0107 graduated in cultural studies and holds an MA in sociology, works at the Peace Institute and, in her free time, is a program coordinator of the Gromka Club in ACC Metelkova City.

You need JavaScript enabled to view it.)     pp. 21\u201328 by Vasja Ris Lebari\u010d     The Desert of Normality     After twenty years the establishment still does not recognize Metelkova City as one of the most important centers of alternative culture. Correspondingly, the alternative scene is still viewed as \u00bbunderdeveloped\u00ab or merely as \u00bbundeveloped mainstream culture.\u00ab Something that can, in the best-case scenario, aspire to develop into an ideologically aligned established culture. The perspective of a \u00bbnot yet\u00ab Metelkova is not problematic due to economic and real estate interests but because of a wider ideological inadequacy, which is expressed also through continuous gentrification attempts. Metelkova is one of the last defense lines of diverse cultural and production modes in the area.     Keywords: ACC Metelkova City, gentrification, subculture, ideology, ideological state apparatuses, relations of production     Vasja Lebari\u010d studied at the Universit\u00e4t der K\u00fcnste in Berlin and at the Academy of fine arts and design, where has obtained BA and MA.

You need JavaScript enabled to view it.)     pp. 29\u201341 by Sa\u0161a Nabergoj     Gesamtkunstwerk Metelkova City     For the last twenty years the protagonists of the ACC Metelkova City have been transforming its public space and the fa\u00e7ades of the buildings by architectural, constructional, artistic and handcraft interventions, thus creating a unique kind of gesamtkunstwerk. The article focuses on the key points of the construction process and its contextualization in a broader historical, social, political and cultural context, thus aiming to define the constitutive elements of artistic practices and procedures of setting up the Metelkova artists\u2019 community. The article highlights the necessity to perceive the entire area as a work-in-progress, with individual segments sometimes disappearing or gradually overlapping with other interventions, and with a number of elements that from the very beginning were meant to be only temporary. This principle, in contrast to the traditional understanding of cultural heritage preservation, appears to be crucial.     Analysis of the Art Policy of ACC Metelkova in Relation to Autonomous Contemporary Art     Starting from the fact that the idea of autonomy appears in the very name of Autonomous Cultural Centre Metelkova City, the article on the one hand outlines the general concept of autonomy in the field of art and the conditions that made its emergence possible, while on the other hand it delves into the particularities of autonomy that is characteristic of Metelkova. Inasmuch as the latter is known to possess a subcultural or alternative character, it is necessary to clearly define the practices that correspond to this characterization. It is argued that a practice can be understood as alternative only if it aims to annul the existing social relations. An alternative practice also cannot be deemed autonomous without doing away with both the concept of authorship as well as the notion of a work of art being a finalized singular product.     Keywords: policy, population, art, authorship, work of art, discipline     Andrej Pezelj is an academic painter, PhD student in sociology, and an independent cultural worker.(This email address is being protected from spambots.

Situation-Intervention-Reflection     The article deals with the spatial issue of Metelkova City, the urban complex situated in the city of Ljubljana. Comparing its northern and southern part, the article focuses on the aesthetics of space, having in mind obvious contrasts of regulation\/use and political connotations of squatting in the northern part where Autonomous Cultural Center Metelkova City is located. Following this, my video intervention is presented at the same venue where it happened, eight years before the writing of this text. In the light of that intervention, which should set a temporary situation of symbolic occupation of the mainstream\u2019s part of the complex, I aim to open a space of reflection of the representation phenomenon that can be put into service of either neutralization or resistance as an open process.     Keywords: United Colors of Metelkova, video, site-specific, intervention, reflection     Gay and Lesbian Scene in Metelkova     The article deals with the development of the gay and lesbian scene in ACC Metelkova, while specifying the preliminary aspects of establishing and building gay and lesbian activism associated with spatial issues. The struggle for space or occupying public space is vital for the gay and lesbian scene, as it provides not only the necessary socializing opportunities for gays and lesbians, but also does away with the historical hiding of homosexuality in the closet, in seclusion and silence. Because of their autonomy and long-term, continuous existence, homo-clubs at Metelkova contributed to the consolidation of the gay and lesbian scene in Slovenia and significantly improved the opportunities for cultural, social and political expression of gays and lesbians. Such a synthesis of the cultural, social and political, further intensified in Metelkova, and characterizes the gay and lesbian community in Slovenia from the very outset of gay and lesbian activism in 1984. It is this long-term synthesis that keeps this community in Slovenia so vital and politically resilient.     Keywords: heteronormative public sphere, gay and lesbian scene, identity politics, queer politics     YHD in Struggle for Independent Living for Disabled     The YHD group (Youth Handicapped Deprivileged) was shaped from the need of young disabled students who wanted to taste freedom and independence. Through revolt, persistence and thirst for answers, the informal movement Youth Handicapped Deprivileged was established. It was later transformed into YHD \u2013 Association for Theory and Culture of Handicap. YHD found a home in ACC Metelkova and has stayed there for 20 years. The theory of handicap and revolt against medical comprehension of disability are the principal guidelines to which the Associations\u2019 projects and actions adhere. Other associations for disabled people are centered around medical diagnoses of its members, whereas YDH aims to bring about positive changes concerning the position of handicapped people in the society. For YHD, disability is a social status and not a characteristic of the body or a mental condition, difficulty or \u00bbspecial need\u00ab. YHD rejects a pre-written script for the lives of the disabled.     Keywords: YHD (Youth Handicapped Deprivileged), theory of handicap, deprivileged groups, independent life of handicapped, Metelkova City     Interview: Andrej Morovi\u0107     For ten years Andrej Morovi\u0107 was one of the key people of the Autonomous Cultural Center Metelkova. In the end of the 90s, he strongly influenced the shaping and transformation of Metelkova from the ruins into a relevant social space for Southeastern Europe. In the interview, he touches upon performance, construction, art, finances, art and political projects of Metelkova City.     Keywords: Metelkova, squatting, construction, social space, art and political project     Building Communities in Resistance: Metelkova City in the Hands of Axt und Kelle     The article deals with nomadic journeymen and journeywomen from the German guild Axt und Kelle and with their encounter with Metelkova. At the outset, the historical trajectory of German guilds, the constitution of Axt und Kelle and the custom of tramping artisans (i.e., walz) are highlighted. The hypothesis that Axt und Kelle make use of re-appropriated spaces (i.e., squats) either as a sporadic proactive clientele or they choose such spaces as their annual summer solidarity work camps is defended on a twofold basis: firstly, squats are considered and constructed as a substitute of the previously guaranteed houses of call (i.e., herberge) by the classical guilds. Secondly, the guild intentionally constituted itself as a political subject with the mission of empowering communities in resistance. ACC Metelkova City was chosen as a solidarity work camp twice in the early and mid-00s when many emblematic interiors and exteriors were created. Focusing on the non-instrumentalized (own) production of knowledge, exchange of experiences and outwardly oriented distribution, the article views the reciprocal interaction between ACC Metelkova City and Axt und Kelle through Mauss\u2019s theory of the gift.     Keywords: squatting, Axt und Kelle, political nomad craft, journey(wo)men, anarchism, gift     Metelkova City     The comic strip deals with Metelkova City and the authorities whatever their political alignment who have been always engaged in dialogue. Occasionally, this dialogue was more stressed, and sometimes it was covered in layers of ambiguity. The discussions between the representatives of ACC Metelkova City and the authorities did not always end with a clear, precise and straightforward conclusion.     A View From My Balcony     The article identifies the differences between that which produces normality and is destructive to the otherness, and that which deconstructs the former and produces the latter in the case of Autonomous Cultural Center Metelkova City. It also delves into the question how to act upon and make (our) world meaningful under the conditions of the present neoliberal market-oriented time and services, and in the era that is essentially characterized by the creative industries and hastened withdrawal of the state from the public sphere. Is it possible in this context to recognize the cultural economy of ACC Metelkova City as merely a duplication of the socially dominant production mode that in effect prevents any autonomous model to evolve? The premise of the article is that we have to clearly differentiate between independent culture and autonomous culture, and monitor both at ACC Metelkova City. The fundamental question is how to incorporate holistic relations of productions within a limited territory into a respective legal order that would not determine the conditions of different production processes itself.     Direct Democracy Will Develop Independently, or Not Happen at All     Protests against neoliberal reforms implemented by the ruling elite, which took place in Slovenia during the winter of 2012\/13, created a public space for reflection on the concept of direct democracy. In the context of very different approaches and conceptions of direct democracy that have appeared within the protest movement, the need for outlining the field of direct democracy arose as a matter of political necessity. The article argues that any discussion on this topic should be based on the perspective of broadening the sphere of basic human rights. Thus we need to pursue and develop direct co-decision-making through deliberative forms inside particular communities. ACC Metelkova City is an example of a political community that develops and applies certain elements of direct participation and represents an important political experiment, as well as object of research.     Keywords: direct democracy, human rights, deliberation, ACC Metelkova City, forum     Against and Beyond the Existing: Building Community in Resistance in Metelkova     The article examines the politics of autonomous spaces. We understand their narration of resistance in the context of ongoing movement against the dominant social order. The existence of autonomous spaces enables people to build social relationships that fundamentally differ from those that are dominant in a society in general, and also at the same time to generate different subversive practices. In the present article, it is argued that autonomous spaces should be understood merely as potential spaces of this subversion inasmuch as its realization depends on the always-ongoing reflection of their own practices. ACC Metelkova is understood as one of such spaces of potentiality or cracks in the struggle against the capitalist system. The state and the capital are trying to discipline, normalize and subdue Metelkova through different mechanisms examined in the article. It is argued that Metelkova needs to remain heterogeneous, since it is vital for effective resistance against the processes of normalization.     Cases from a Set of Contradictions in Daily Practices of Autonomous Spaces     The article highlights the significance of autonomous spaces. Instituting autonomous spaces and working in them is usually a contradictory and multidimensional process that has a plethora of different effects for those involved, ranging from exceptionally positive to extremely frustrating ones. My experiences derive from collaboration in various liberated spaces in Ljubljana, mostly in the Rog Social Center and Boj Za, an occupied square in front of the Ljubljana Stock Exchange, and at the same time from my role of a user of ACC Metelkova. The methodology is based on a form of participant observation in specific types of autonomous spaces that strive towards openness, horizontality, non-profit and inclusion. Being fully aware that generalizations are possible only to a certain extent as each space is characterized by a multitude of experiences and ideas, I still believe that we can address some thoughts or even misunderstandings shared by people active in both autonomous space as well as in wider public. Mostly those that are usually absent in comparable texts as they are considered too trivial, even though they frequently impede daily practices in autonomous spaces and their development.

General social devastation that is the result of a neoliberal assault on society also confronts autonomous spaces with a fundamental question: what can be their role in this ever-greater destruction? Can these places function as organizational nodes for the needs of the new social margin? What would this mean in practice?     Improvisation on Theme 93\/13: Orientation of a Precarious Musician in the New Global Order     The article discusses several aspects of massive cultural infrastructure developments, especially those devoted to the so-called independent culture, in Ljubljana. These took place two decades after the squatting of former military barracks in the city center and its transformation into the alternative Autonomous Cultural Center Metelkova City (1993\u20132013). It pays special attention to the urban-planning and cultural policies of urban regeneration of several city parts, especially in regard to construction of cultural and creative districts in Ljubljana, in which also ACC Metelkova City is (potentially) situated. In its second part the article attempts to detect, by exemplifying certain events and practices of different stakeholders, an ambivalent character of ACC Metelkova City in particular, and of the cultural and arts sphere in Ljubljana in general, in the overlapping points of two discursive complexes in conceptions: of liminality and creative destruction.     Keywords: Ljubljana, Metelkova City, cultural infrastructure, alternative, independent culture, urban regeneration, creative industry, cultural districts, liminality, creative destruction     Bratko Bibi\u010d is a composer and accordion performer, sociologist and philosopher, researcher and writer, decades long engaged in alternative and independent cultural field, with special emphasis on spatial issues.

You need JavaScript enabled to view it.)     pp. 197\u2013210 by Marko Hren     Progressivity Enhanced     Rather than a scientific text, the author contributes a concise memorandum from the originator of the idea who has managed the campaign for the conversion of the military barracks into a creative cluster between 1988 and 2002, when he parted ways with Metelkova due to conflicting views on the center\u2019s future. His views shed light on a distant period of time from a perspective of a participant\u2013observer. The information is abundantly supported by primary sources, also available online. However, some of the presented hypotheses are heavily influenced by his personal experiences of xenophobia, elitism, and predatorial behavior, which were already then discernible on the so-called alternative scene as well \u2013 so much so that they obstructed the implementation of progressive programs. The author claims that, in spite of the substantially different reality today, the myths and prejudices concerning Metelkova must be done away with in order to enhance its progressive nature. Above all, the paper calls for an objective view on internal antagonisms, mainly originating in deep class divisions between the users. These make a clear distinction between truly marginal ndividuals and the overambitious beau-bourgeois, as the author labels the large part of users of Metelkova of \u00bbhis\u00ab time. On these grounds, he argues for a robust approach to ban all forms of xenophobia and self-ghettoization.     Marko Hren was an activist within peace and human rights movements, speaker of the campaign for complete demilitarization of Slovenia (1988-1991), and in this context he designed and initiated the conversion of the \u2013 at that time central - Yugoslav military barracks at Metelkova Street in Ljubljana into a creative cluster.

However, several other lesser-known initiatives also played a key role in this dynamic, for instance Resistance Breaking Network, Mass People's Committee, and People's Defense of Metelkova. From this circle and in the aftermath of the occupation, a Metelkova PR group was formed. The interview that Andrej Pavli\u0161i\u010d conducted with two members of PR group Miha Zadnikar and Nikolai Jeffs focus on both the immediate as well as wider political and social context of the occupation, and revisit some of the lesser-known challenges of Metelkova\u2019s early period.

      "text":" At the lower end of the superior quality wines pyramid \u2013 though differences across, including the top, are practically negligible \u2013 Sauvignon Blanc is well suited to predicate making. The rule of thumb is that the higher the predicate, the more it starts losing its varietal character which starts making way for botrytis and over-ripe notes. Not always, though, and especially not in Sauvignon Blanc, which often surprises with its apparently sturdy and resilient characteristic aromas. It develops a beautifully shimmering colour of aged gold, showing hints of dry hay, paprika, peppermint, carob and tropical fruit on the nose. Characteristically varietal, then, with botrytis ripeness in the background. Due to the staple Sauvignon acidity, which makes the wine go down smoothly despite the sugar, it'll hold on for years to come.     Sommelier recommends     Food pairing: A selection, a challenge. Looking for the best fit between food and wine, in this case both from sweet domains, the palate must sense the flavours together so that the dish doesn't overpower the wine or vice versa, but a melody instead plays out harmoniously in the mouth, both parts contributing to a whole greater than their sum. You can even try and match the specific aromas, paralleling the peppermint, carob and tropical fruit hints of the wine with mint, carob and tropical fruits in a dessert.

      "text":" Graphic novel wins book of year award     Ljubljana, 1 December - An idiosyncratic graphic novel that was originally released in instalments on Facebook has won the Grand Prix for book of the year at the Slovenian Book Fair.     Ljubljana The poster for this year's Slovenian Book Fair. Photo: Cankarjev Dom     \"Vinjete Straholjubca\" (The B\u00eate Noire Vignettes) is a joint project by writer Eva Mahkovic and illustrator Eva Mlinar, and the first original Slovenian release by VigeVageKnjige, a publisher specialised in translations of comics and graphic novels.     Originally a series of short snippets posted on Facebook between 2011 and 2015, the project morphed into a loosely connected collage of horror stories that the publisher describes as \"an attempt to create a literary and visual collection of the grotesque of an elusive genre\".     The Book Fair jury, comprising literature lovers as well as industry professionals, described it as an \"intimate and provocative manifestation of a tangle of lucid ideas by two authors\".     The authors have created a rich fantastic world of their own, but they also draw profusely on sources including the Bible, William Shakespeare, Truman Capote and Umberto Eco.     The book is \"controlled down to the last detail, enhancing the reader's experience of encountering the emerging genre of the graphic novel,\" according to jury member Domen Fras, a graphic designer.     The award is not confined to any one genre, all books published between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019 were eligible. The works were judged as integral pieces of art, with the jury considering not just the stories but also layout, language, graphic design, illustration and photography.     The winner was selected by Slovenian Book Fair visitors from among a shortlist of five very diverse works which included a literarised tour guide of Istria, a poetry collection, and a collection of Facebook posts by Mahkovic, the only author with two shortlisted works.     Jury member Nina Ko\u017ear said the selection was accidentally heavy on books that were created on modern platforms: three started out on Facebook and one seems like it did.     The award was conferred on the last day of the 35th Slovenian Book Fair on Sunday. "

Comedy about the End of the World     Pre\u0161ernovo gledali\u0161\u010de Kranj     \"Majerhold: This is not a time for farce. Reality requires earnest dramas. Joe Orton: Reality is a farce. Where have you been living until now that you don't already get that ?\"     Comedy About the End of the World attracted me immediately because of its metaphorical actuality and ironic worldview and human activity. The end of the world is at the door, banging on it threateningly. And the actors in the Comedy are thinking how to make some money out of it. (Janez Burger)     Comedy About the End of the World is a farce about a farce, inhabited by another farce. It\u2019s a farce, just as our reality is a farce, although, as its hero articulates, \"it\u2019s not time for farces. Reality requires earnest dramas.\" Reality requires, as the author accurately detects, for us to ask about the end of the world, to ask if we should plant our own vegetable garden or continue to grow grass and weed \u2013 and deal it ... This is exactly what four characters \u2013 all marked with their own imaginary theatre reality, yet all easily recognisable from our immediate reality \u2013 are asking themselves at the edge of a town in a house with a neglected garden, on an almost Beckett-like setting. The subtenant Joe Orton, an unrealised playwright, Elvira, the owner and an unrealised actress, the new subtenant Majerhold, an environmental scientist under cover, and Konjevi\u010d, a man with various made-up identities, cannot agree on the purpose of the garden and saving the world and so the author\u2019s anything but optimistic drama forecast of the method of solving society\u2019s current problems at the threshold of the end of the world lets us know clearly that in the battle of principled innovators and conscienceless money-makers just as often before and despite the apocalyptic predictions the latter will win. Besides that, this play, with skilfully written dialogues filled with aphorisms and clever word plays makes us ask what is real in it, and in general real in the first place, who is genuine and who\u2019s hiding behind a mask and above all, is the end of the world the approaching reality or simply a backdrop to a battle of different interests, a battle where both revolutionary scientists and exploitative profit makers are all in hiding Comedy About the End of the World takes a fresh approach to dealing with the most burning global-local topics and vividly depicts the state of the spirit at home and abroad, while giving us the impression that the whole world\u2019s just a stage. Thus, we\u2019ll never learn the answer to the title question from tenant Joe Orton\u2019s never written play: \"Why did all the fucking values fail?\" (from the Grum Award jury statement)     Writer, playwright, essayist, editor, translator Evald Flisar has received the Pre\u0161eren Fund Award and \u017dupan\u010di\u010d Lifetime Achievement Award. His work has been translated into twenty-three languages, among those English, German, Czech, Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Malay, Marati, Indonesian, Nepali, Icelandic, Spanish, Turkish, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc. His plays are regularly staged in professional theatres all over the world (in just the last two years, they\u2019ve been staged in Austria, Belarus, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Taiwan and Japan). The Pre\u0161eren Theatre Kranj put on the baptismal performance of his play Nora Nora in 2004 and of his play Aquarium three years later. Both were directed by Du\u0161an Mlakar.

IMPORTANT NOTICE     Dear patients,     With the phasing-out of measures at the national level and the order of the Ministry of Health on temporary measures in the field of health care in view of containment and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, Community Health Centre Ljubljana has gradually begun increasing the scope of available health care services. Given the current epidemiological situation, from the point of view of safety of patients and medical staff alike, caution is still required, as well as the use of personal protective equipment and taking all the measures necessary to prevent corona virus infection.     Check-up with a GP and all other activities at the Community Health Centre Ljubljana are only possible after a prior appointment and consultation with the medical staff (over the phone or via e-mail). Your GP will assess your medical condition and reach a professional decision about any necessary treatment. The assessment can be made via e-mail, over the phone, or directly through a medical check-up.     If you have symptoms and show signs of COVID-19, your GP will refer you over the phone for swab testing and\/or a check-up at a COVID clinic, therefore never visit the health centre unannounced.     In the event of a life-threatening condition, call 112 immediately.     For your scheduled appointment, please arrive at the health centre no more than 5 minutes before the appointment.     At the entrance to the health centre, disinfect your hands and put on a surgical mask; wear the mask at all times for the duration of your visit.     Please observe a personal safety distance of at least 1.5 metres in all areas of the health centre.     On the day before your check-up, you should receive a call from the medical staff, who will check your medical and epidemiological condition by means of a questionnaire. It is advisable to print out and fill in the Questionnaire for the assessment of medical condition before treatment in the outpatient clinic at home, and bring it with you for your scheduled appointment.     Only healthy persons should come for a check-up. If a person falls ill, we kindly ask them to inform us of the fact and so waive their appointment time to somebody else.     ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES (PRESCRIPTIONS, SICK LEAVE ...)     All administrative services, such as issuing prescriptions for chronic therapy, referrals for check-ups, orders for medical devices, at the discretion of the GP possibly also sick leave, are performed remotely over the phone or, most preferably, by e-mail. When contacting us via e-mail, please state your name and surname, date of birth, Health Insurance Card number and the telephone number where you can be reached.     ENTERING THE HEALTH CENTRE     With the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the population, entering the Community Health Centre Ljubljana is limited and runs exclusively through the triage point. We ask all patients entering the health centre to provide the nurse with ACCURATE and TRUE information about their health condition, possible visits to high-risk areas and any close contact with infected persons. Providing untrue information means endangering one\u2019s own health and everyone else\u2019s.     WEEKENDS, PUBLIC HOLIDAYS AND NIGHT-TIME     On weekends, public holidays and at night, the paediatric emergency first-aid service (PNMP) and adult emergency first-aid service (SNMP) run in an unchanged manner. In case of symptoms suspected of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, cold, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting), make an appointment over the phone and do not visit the emergency service unannounced.     Before seeking emergency medical help, consider whether a check-up is necessary or whether you can wait for the workday to call your personal or a substitute practitioner.     Ustna higiena     Samopla\u010dni\u0161ka ambulanta za ustno higieno v Zdravstvenem domu Ljubljana deluje \u017ee od leta 2009. Lahko re\u010demo, da se pona\u0161amo tako s kakovostjo in znanjem, kot s konkuren\u010dnimi cenami ter smo glede na kakovost \u0161e vedno med cenej\u0161imi.     Profesionalno odstranjevanje zobnih oblog je najbolj\u0161a preventiva pred zobno gnilobo in parodontalno boleznijo. Z osebno ustno higieno o\u010distimo le 70 % zobnih povr\u0161in v ustni votlini, zato je priporo\u010dljivo, da enkrat do dvakrat letno obi\u0161\u010dite ustnega higienika, ki vam bo profesionalno o\u010distil kriti\u010dna mesta, kjer so se nabrale zobne obloge, spoliral zobe in podu\u010dil o pravilni tehniki ustne higiene.     Parodontalna bolezen ali vnetje obzobnih tkiv je stanje, ko se iz nezdravljenega akutnega (za\u010detnega) vnetja dlesni med zobom in dlesnijo pojavijo patolo\u0161ko pove\u010dani obzobni \u017eepi, tudi slab zadah, zobje lahko postanejo navidezno dalj\u0161i (zaradi umikanja dlesni), ob\u010dutljivi ali se za\u010dnejo majati in posledi\u010dno izpadejo.     Z vzpostavitvijo pravilne ustne higiene in profesionalno, mehani\u010dno odstranitvijo plaka, zobnega kamna ter ostalih mehanskih ovir, ki omogo\u010dajo zadr\u017eevanje zobnih oblog, se gingivitis (za\u010detno, akutno vnetje dlesni) popolnoma pozdravi in ne pu\u0161\u010da trajnih posledic na obzobnih tkivih.     Namen za\u010detnega zdravljenja parodontalne bolezni je zmanj\u0161ati koli\u010dino bakterij, katere se nahajajo v zobnih oblogah, ki so glavni vzrok za nastanek parodontalne bolezni, in s tem zmanj\u0161ati vnetje dlesni. S pomo\u010djo ultrazvo\u010dnih in\u0161trumentov odstranimo plak in trde zobne obloge s povr\u0161ine zoba nad dlesnijo in iz obzobnih \u017eepov. Z ro\u010dnimi in\u0161trumenti pa povr\u0161ine korenin zlu\u0161\u010dimo in zagladimo. Isto\u010dasno odstranimo vse mehanske ovire, ki so lahko vzrok za zadr\u017eevanje zobnih oblog. Paciente natan\u010dno pou\u010dimo o pravilnih tehnikah \u010di\u0161\u010denja zob in tekom zdravljenja tudi spremljamo njihovo pravilno izvajanje.     Dva do tri mesece po opravljenem za\u010detnem zdravljenju se opravi kontrolni pregled. \u010ce kljub predhodnim postopkom ne pride do bistvenega izbolj\u0161anja, sledi druga, kirur\u0161ka faza zdravljenja, ki jo nadaljuje specialist parodontolog. Pred obiskom parodontologa se mora pacient zglasiti pri svojem osebnem zobozdravniku, ker se morata zobozdravnik in parodontolog glede nadaljevanja zdravljenja uskladiti in dogovoriti. Pacienti z nezadostno in nepravilno ustno higieno niso primerni za kirur\u0161ki poseg.     Izvajajo:     ZDL \u2013 Be\u017eigrad: Emira Be\u0107irbegovi\u0107, ustni hig.

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Meeting of the Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia of 2 November 2010     11\/02\/2010 \/ Press release     1. The Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia adopted the Resolution on the General Rules for Monetary Policy Implementation. 2. The Governing Board discussed the Overview of the Financial Accounts of Slovenia 2004 - 2009, which was prepared for individual institutional sectors with a presentation of financial assets and liabilities in terms of financial instruments of material significance to the financial sector; a comparison with the euro area financial accounts is also presented for the first time. The overview will be included and published in the report, entitled Financial Accounts of Slovenia 2004 - 2009. 3. The Governing Board discussed the current economic and financial trends, and approved the publication of the Economic and Financial Trends of October 2010, and Slovenia\u2019s International Economic Relations of August 2010. The Governing Board substantiates that the cost competitiveness of the Slovenian economy is trailing behind the cost competitiveness of its main economic partners, Germany, France, Austria and Italy. Faster growth in energy costs (gas, electricity) and services costs (water, municipal services) could have a significant impact on competitive pricing by exporters. The Governing Board draws attention to the importance of movements in prices that are not subject to market competition for the creation of the right macroeconomic conditions for the real sector of the economy and the preservation of disposable income for households.     4. The Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia discussed the current operations of the banks, developments on the capital markets and developments in the area of interest rates. "

      "text":" The Bulgarian MULTEXT-East fiction corpus contains the novel ``PASSION or the death of Alice'' by Emilia Dvorianova and and the first four chapters of the novel ``I want, I believe, I can'' by Julia Berberyan.     The first novel was first published by ``OBSIDIAN'', Sofia in 1995, the second - by ``Abagar Holding'', Sofia in 1995. The Bulgarian site obtained the author's \/ publisher's agreement allowing the use of novels for the purposes of the MULTEXT-East project.     ``PASSION or the death of Alice'' was provided in WINWORD format, while ``I want, I believe, I can'' in 'Page maker' format. The texts were converted to ASCII files.     The Bulgarian Fiction corpus contains 98371 words. The first part (``PASSION or the death of Alice'') contains 54100 words approx., the second part - 44200 words approx.     The corpus body consists of 15 <div type=chapter>, the number of each chapter is given in the attribute n of the tag. The chapters from ``I want, I believe, I can''start with a <head> giving the title of the chapter.     The <div type=chapter> elements have the n attribute, giving the chapter number, and the id attribute, whose value has the prefix Fictbg followed by a period, a string, identifying the book, and the chapter number, for example <div type=chapter n=1 id=Fictbg.alice.1.1>.     The text is segmented into paragraphs, with the <head>, <quote>, <opener>, <poem> elements marked-up at the paragraph level.     Sub-paragraph tagging consists of <abbr>, <foreign>, <hi> <date>, <name>, <l>, <num> and <q>. Direct speech has been marked-up by <q>. ``PASSION or the death of Alice'' is tagged in full at the sub-paragraph level. ``I want, I believe, I can'' is tagged partially.     Rendering information, given as the CES conformant two-letter value of the rend attribute has been included with the appropriated tags and, for mdash and capitalisation, retained in the tag content.     The following is an example from the Bulgarian Fiction corpus; the characters are, in the original, encoded as SGML ISO Cyrillic entities (e.g. &ocy;); to make the following sample more readable, they were automatically transliterated into Latin (e.g. &ocy; o).     The versions which were the basis for the encoding, were ASCII files. The text contained a number of misrendered punctuation and spelling mistakes. A spell-checker was used to correct the spelling mistakes. It should be noted that the original electronic texts contained Latin letters used as cyrillic (e.g. latin ``e'' instead of cyrillic ``e'') Their occurrences were discovered by the spell-checker, but we had to substitute latin with cyrillic letters manually. In the following example, the Cyrillic letters have been transliterated back into Latin: "

      "text":" Development of the NeoRhythm brainwave entrainment device     TECOS has developed the NeoRhythm is the first brainwave entrainment device with multi-coil structure and gesture controls, which makes it one of the most user-friendly neurostimulation devices on the market.     It helps you get into the desired state of mind by emitting scientifically supported frequencies through electromagnetic fields. The brain synchronizes with these frequencies to help you relax, enhance focus, energize body and mind, fall asleep quicker and sleep better, meditate better or soothe your pain. NeoRhythm is a low\/medium-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation device (LI\/MI rTMS). With appropriate positioning of the coils inside the device, which generate electromagnetic fields, we precisely target the right brain locations to get the desired effect. NeoRhythm\u2019s efficiency is confirmed by two independent double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and supported by many other scientific studies.     Figure 1: NeoRhythm device     TECOS was tasked with determining the shape of the device with all the desired functionality. One of the major development requirements was the adaptability of the device to different head sizes and providing as least intrusive use as possible. Due to the desired flexibility of the device, we developed various concepts that were mechanically verified by computer simulations and physically fabricated with prototype technologies and tested (different concepts of the device are shown in Figure 1). We have produced all the necessary documentation for the construction of batch production tools for the chosen concept, which allows for easy flexibility. The technological manufacturing process was verified by computerized injection moulding simulations and the product, tool constructions and manufacturing process were optimized. The certification and production phase of batch production tools was followed by zero production in October 2019, with the latest optimisation of tools and the start of batch production in early November 2019.     Slika 2: Close-up of NeoRhythm device     TECOS has been successfully cooperating with Slovenian companies for over 25 years and is also recognized within Europe. It is involved in all branches of the manufacturing industry, specializing in the design, optimization and development of (mainly plastic) parts, processes, materials and the entire production system and its individual assemblies. It offers integrated solutions to companies from different industries - turnkey projects in product development, which include product design based on an idea, advanced computer-aided analysis (from mechanical, thermal calculations to various technological simulations, such as plastic injection moulding simulations), prototyping, small-scale and batch production of plastic components, component measurements and reverse engineering and installation of batch production processes.     Figure 3: Simulations are an important part of product development.     You can support the development of NeoRhythm on the INDIEGOGO crowdfunding platform.

      "text":" Pismo poslano 21. septembra 2011 idejnemu avtorju \"The Venus project\" Jacquesu Fresco.     Dear Mr. Fresco,     I kindly ask you for your attention. I do believe the following consideration could interest you. My name is Jure Vuga, I'm an art historian, cultural sociologist and poet from Koper, Slovenia. I am very inspired by your work and your ideas about the redesign of the twenty-first century society and the introduction of the resource based economy. However, to be polemic, in your statement that \u201call the natural resources should be declared common heritage of the worlds people\u201d I can still perceive a level of anthropocentric egoism.     In my opinion the sustainable development of a peaceful civilization can only be obtained with the total abolition of the slaughter houses. The violence and insensibility towards the needs and feelings of the animals (and also plants) is the foundation of the violence in our omnivorous societies. There isn\u2019t any doubt and anthropologists are well aware that the method of killing animals in agricultural societies was applied also to human victims in the period of war. Killing animals on industrial scale in the slaughter houses is not dissimilar from the industry of death of the concentration camps.     I have seen your comment about vegetarianism. I am convinced that meat-eating as well as vegetarian-diet are obsolete and atavistic practices. If our goal of social transformation has to be achieved, we cannot dismiss the revolutionary importance of the raw food diet. I kindly ask you for your complete attention and insight.     You, yourself affirm that man are being conditioned and indoctrinated by the environment. We are \u201cvictims\u201d of cultural patterns which are invisible and we stick to them and replicate them without knowing. One of the mightiest indoctrinations we undergo, which is consequentially also the base of greed and insane accumulation, is the need to heat the food we eat. Let me explain.     Cooking is a technology that has helped humans (the fire was invented by Homo Erectus 2,5 million years ago) to survive in the dry savanna and during the glacial era, to colonize the globe develop towns and sophisticated civilization. The price for this achievement however is the precarious health conditions of the individuals. No single animal in nature cooks its food. Natural selection and technology are incompatible. The giraffe would never have a long neck if it was using a tool to collect the leaves from the branches of the trees.     It is a matter of radical Darwinism: humans and apes descend from a common ancestor; therefore humans are classified among frugivor, which eat mostly fruit, vegetable (leaves), nuts, seeds and little amount of raw meet (insects, shells). The passage to a raw food diet (living in a fertile environment as in my case) gives you a live experience of post scarcity lifesyle due to abundance of free food and the feeling of connection with the \u201cMother Venus\u201d. Humans are not genetically adapted for eating cooked food, but all the institutions and even scientists ignore this fact! The result of our culturally determined behavior that instructs us to eat heated food is a traumatic way of aging (in comparison to animals), undernourishment on a cellular level (no animal has white hair), and a wide range of diseases that we cure with medicines. The addiction to cooked food is the first of all addictions. The mixture of fat, sugar and salt in the processed food causes dependence. Therefore raw food should be universally recognized as the only food good enough for humans.     Scientific research has shown that from the psychological point of view food and money are closely related in the brain centers. A well fed person will donate money for charity much more likely than if he\/she was hungry. Because of the (virtual) lack of food (we have to work to provide it) and the existential fear of getting old and debilitated, people have developed a selfish attitude aimed to accumulate and store goods for their personal need. Capitalism is essentially a reflection or a symptom of the alienated state of mind of individuals who have never developed the consciousness that the loving nature provides everyone with everything they need for their existence at the right moment.     And if we dare to develop the vision of a society based on raw food diet, we can soon realize that we are talking about something completely new and unforeseen, a society in which there is no famine and shortage of food and the people remain young and vital during their old age too. When a child is born a few fruit trees would be planted to provide nutrition for the time to come. All animals would be companions of humans and have the same dignity. It would be a society liberated from chronic diseases (diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, arthritis, lower rates of cancer etc.) and the abuse of alcohol and drugs. Expelling meat from the diet results in less aggressive behavior and decrease of sexual frustration. Families composed by raw food eaters could be almost completely auto sufficient if provided with some land (permaculture would be introduced spontaneously). The outcome would be the boycott of the industries (food-processing, chemical, pharmaceutical, entertainment, beauty etc.), the fall of the monetary system and the reintroduction of an economy based on exchanging goods, knowledge and work.     I solicit you Mr. Fresco and the circle of the fellows of the Venus project to seriously consider the wide-ranging implications of implementing the raw food diet in your project and spreading the message about the revolutionary force of eating uncooked food. From my experience I can assure you that there is nothing easier of being a raw food eater (it\u2019s the third year of my new life now), after all we were all born as raw food eaters; returning to the primeval state of being gives no less than immense joy, interior peace and unshakable optimism.     It would be a great honor if some day you would come to Ljubljana to have a lecture. The people of Slovenia are much concerned about sustainable development and we are very interested in your project.

Critical oil and gas production components rely on metrology systems     For companies operating in the oil and gas equipment-manufacturing sector, recordkeeping and traceability are vital. As part of its company-wide quality protocol, FMC Technologies in Dunfermline, Scotland invests continually in a preventive maintenance programme that employs Renishaw machine tool probes and calibration products to check and verify the dimensional accuracy of its CNC machine tools.     FMC Technologies is a Houston, Texas-based developer and manufacturer of oil and gas Production Control Systems (PCSs). A PCS consists of topside (surface) controls, power equipment, the Subsea Control Module (SCM), various sensors, and subsea electrical and hydraulic distribution equipment. The whole system is configurable according to conditions and requirements, and provides engineers on-board an oil or gas production platform with precise control of the well.     FMC Technologies has operations around the world, close to the major oil and gas industry epicenters. Its UK manufacturing operation occupies several buildings on and around the Pitreavie Business Park, Dunfermline, a short drive from Edinburgh, across the Forth Road Bridge.     Craig Simpson and Mike West are FMC Technologies maintenance technicians, with responsibility for the service and support of 20 CNC machine tools of various types, makes and ages. Also in their charge is one of the company's more recent investments: a \u00a32.5 million, purpose-designed and built, SCM machining cell, consisting of two Okuma Space Centre MA-600HB CNC horizontal boring machines, loaded and managed by a Fastems automation system.     An SCM contains electronics, instrumentation, and hydraulics for safe and efficient operation of valves and chokes on the well-top \u2018subsea tree'.     \u201cThere are four, main, machined parts in an SCM,\u201d says Craig Simpson, \u201cone high, and one low pressure adaptor plate; the manifold block itself, and a base plate. There are also a large number of small valves and electronic circuit boards that go into the whole assembly.\u201d     Wells can be as far as 120 km from the production platform, in water up to 10,000 feet deep. Producing oil and gas safely and reliably under such conditions requires companies to make enormous investments. When an SCM is installed on the seabed, it has to be reliable and safe for the production life of the well, which can be decades. Hydraulically controlled valves must be free from defects and contamination. If a critical part malfunctions, the potential cost can easily run to tens-, or even hundreds-of-millions of dollars.     The Fastems automated cell is used to machine the stainless steel hydraulic manifold block, which is a critical control element in an SCM assembly. The 267 kg block is approximately 400 mm x 400 mm x 400 mm and is a complex of 350-drilled holes. The company will make more than 200 manifold blocks in 2014, when the cell is fully operational and capable of working \u2018lights-out'. Should a tool break during the machining cycle, a Renishaw NC4 laser-based tool setting system will detect the tool absence and notify the Fastems system, which will reject the pallet and replace it with another.     For companies operating in the oil and gas equipment-manufacturing sector, recordkeeping and traceability are vital.     [1280 x 720] [52.4MB]     Guiding principles     FMC Technologies is guided by what it calls the 5-absolutes of quality, the second of which emphasizes the importance of prevention, \u2018not appraisal' as the \u2018cause' of quality. \u201cQuality control in the new cell is extremely thorough,\u201d adds Mr. Simpson. \u201cThe finished part is 100% inspected and has to be precise and flawless before it can be shipped to assembly.\u201d For example, since each SCM manifold block takes up to 35-hours to machine, FMC Technologies engineers need to know that the Okuma machines in the Fastems cell are performing exactly as they should be. Scrapping a semi-finished or finished part due to an inaccuracy in the machine geometry would be very expensive.     \u201cTraceability is everything,\u201d says Mr. Simpson. \u201cWe have to be seen to be keeping precise records of our machining processes. We have to know if and when a machine is out of alignment, for any reason, so we can put it right. Then, when the problem is fixed, we have to be 100% sure that the machine is accurate, again.\u201d To ensure that its 20 machines are accurate, the FMC Technologies' maintenance department services them all, up to three times annually. All machines are checked with a Renishaw QC20-W wireless ballbar. The Okuma machines are serviced twice a year, at which point machine geometries are checked and rectified. Once a year the company also checks them with a Renishaw XL-80 laser measurement system and linearity is corrected. Every second year, at their annual service, all machines are leveled, aligned and checked with the XL-80 system.     \u201cDuring the routine service we check each machine in the factory using the Renishaw ballbar,\u201d says Mr. Simpson. \u201cWe keep those records so, should a finished or shipped part show a fault or a problem, we can prove whether the machine was accurate and aligned at the time the part was manufactured. In the event of an accuracy \u2018issue', we can also re-run the Renishaw ballbar, and compare the results with the records, to see how the dimensional accuracy of the machine has been affected.     \u201cWe use the Renishaw laser primarily to check linear dimensions,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe have Renishaw RMP60 touch probes on most of our machines, including the Okumas, so we need to know the linear movements are exactly right.\u201d FMC Technologies' service contract with Renishaw includes 11 RMP60 touch probes with radio signal transmission, which are replaced annually or in the event one is damaged. FMC Technologies initially invested in the CNC Reporter software primarily for keeping production records. But, the company's maintenance department has also found it invaluable and has recently invested in several, additional licenses.     \u201cThe Renishaw package is very useful for comparing data, and it's not very expensive,\u201d says Mike West. \u201cSo, we've bought another six seats, solely for maintenance operations. Having CNC Reporter means in the event of an accuracy issue, we don't have to drag out the granite-square, parallel bars, etc.,\u201d adds Mr. Simpson. \u201cWe don't even have to remove the job from table. It saves a lot of time.\u201d To help speed-up machine checking and calibration in the SCM cell, FMC Technologies has designed and built a custom calibration block, which it mounts on the Okuma machines during scheduled maintenance or when the machine is being checked.     \u201cWe're currently introducing a new pallet size in the SCM cell, and some of the re-programming is being done manually, rather than off-line, using the Siemens NX CAE system. There's increased potential for minor collisions. For example, we recently had a small knock. First, we ran the Renishaw ballbar to check the 3-axes were square. We also checked the Y-axis using a test bar and we compared the results to the data in CNC Reporter. We found that the zero position had been affected, so we re-taught the machine new zero positions using the test block.\u201d     Craig Simpson and Mike West both agree that the Renishaw XL-80 laser measurement system, the QC20-W wireless ballbar and CNC Reporter software are very easy and intuitive to use. \u201cWe had one week of training with a Renishaw engineer,\u201d says Mr. West. \u201cIf ever we have a problem or a question, we call the head office in Gloucestershire and we usually get an answer the first time. At the very least, someone calls us back that day.\u201d FMC Technologies' fifth \u2018absolute of quality' states that the goal of quality control is not customer satisfaction, but is in fact, customer success. The company claims that its Production Control Systems \u2013 including its SCMs are used on more than 1,000 subsea wells around the world, with an uptime rate of 99 \u2013 100%!     Nevertheless, Craig Simpson says the maintenance programme in FMC Technologies in Dunfermline is evolving continually: \u201cWhen I first started at the company, six years ago, our preventive maintenance was far less structured and much more time consuming. Now, we are very well organised and using the Renishaw equipment means we know much more about our machines and our processes. We're always looking for ways to do things better. Our performance standard is zero defects, which is the third absolute in our quality philosophy. Nothing leaves this machine shop unless it is exactly right, but we couldn't do it without Renishaw.\u201d     Next steps     Downloads     For companies operating in the oil and gas equipment-manufacturing sector, recordkeeping and traceability are vital. As part of its company-wide quality protocol, FMC Technologies in Dunfermline, Scotland, invests continually in a preventive maintenance programme that employs Renishaw machine tool probes and calibration products to check and verify the dimensional accuracy of its CNC machine tools.

Why are some of my data missing?     So far, we have not encountered a case where a survey simply disappeared. Based on previous experience, we can say that one of the following scenarios occurred:     Data filtering is turned on. The problem can be solved by removing all filters. In the 'DATA' - 'Browse' tab, you can filter the data based on variables, statuses, conditions or time periods (upper right side of the page above the data table).     Data were saved in the database (with all the respondents' answers), but the data file (which is generated from the database as a basis for analysis and export) was not generated properly. In some cases, especially when a survey has been inactive for a specific period of time, the data file must be generated manually (this is usually done automatically). This can be done in the 'DATA' - 'Browse' tab in the upper far right corner of the page by clicking on the two arrows icon \u2013 'Generate the data file again' \u2013 next to the 'Filters' icon.     In certain cases, when a respondent stated they completed the survey, but the survey editors cannot see their contribution, one of the following scenarios occurred:     the respondent completed another survey;     one of the editors of the survey mistakenly deleted the record by mistake; "

With the eagerness to prevent the loss of memory on one of the darkest sides of human history, the UN General Assembly proclaimed the 27 January as the International Holocaust Remembrance Day.     Center of Jewish Cultural Heritage Synagogue Maribor commemorates the International Holocaust Remembrance Day since 2010 annually with the project \u201cShoah \u2013 Let Us Remember\u201d, whereas each year more and more organizers throughout Slovenia are joining the project.

      "text":" ABOUT THE AGENCY     The Environmental Agency is a body of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning. It performs expert, analytical, regulatory and administrative tasks related to the environment at the national level. Thus the Agency's mission is to monitor, analyse and forecast natural phenomena and processes in the environment, and to reduce natural threats to people and property. These tasks are performed by the national services for meteorology, hydrology and seismology. The Agency's mission is also to monitor environmental contamination and to provide reliable public environmental data; to this end, the Agency has the appropriate measuring network and laboratories in place. Its mission of exceptional importance is, moreover, to meet the requirements regarding environmental protection deriving from the regulations in force, to preserve natural resources and the biotic diversity and to ensure sustainable development of the country.     The Environmental Agency contributes most towards solving environmental problems by implementing environmental legislation. At the Agency, we handle administrative procedures involving those entities required to pay environmental charges: water fees and taxes on water pollution, carbon dioxide emission and waste disposal. The environmental charges are an extremely effective and well thought-out instrument of environmental protection. A considerable part of these funds is used by the same entities themselves to reduce the environmental burden.     We issue a variety of environmental permits. One project of particular complexity is the issuance of permits for large-scale polluters \u2013 i.e. IPPC permits. We keep records of emissions, regulate and monitor restoration programmes, and undertake similar tasks. We take an integrated approach to solving climate change \u2013 a consequence of excess greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. At the Agency, we monitor and record these emissions and apply relevant system measures in order to reduce them. Since, in Slovenia, climate change is manifested in a modified precipitation regime, changes in temperatures and in the more frequent natural disasters, we monitor the consequences of climate change in our specialised services and also prepare programmes within individual divisions to reduce the consequences of climate change and make appropriate adjustments. A special role in this process is played by the water management area.     The Environmental Agency pays particular attention to awareness-raising concerning the environment and related issues. If properly sensitised, the public can do a great deal for the protection of our environment. Therefore the quality of our services is most important for all users. For this purpose, we have acquired the ISO 9001: 2008 Quality Management Certificate and, earlier, the certificates for the calibraton laboratory and the chemical analytical laboratory, respectively. The establishment of the quality system and subsequent acquisition of the quality certificate was dictated by the special requirements related to aviation meteorology, which we also cover. Furthermore, we expect it will have important positive effects on operational organisation and streamlining. "

      "text":" Aquart - sopart     Vlado Repnik Gotvan\u2019s newest project is focused on further development of his interdisciplinary studies wherein he tries to unlock the questions of time, memory, body, transitory nature of human existence, obliteration, etc\u2026. His project, which one could define as a collective gesture or a joint venture of involvement and co-participation, could at the same be seen as a theatre play, an exhibition, a performance, an interactive installation, lays bare some of the most relevant questions concerning the placement of human body in a technological environment. Repnik\u2019s piece is represented through a form of a huge transparent cube with an installed water heater inside of it, which generates steam and constantly blurs viewers\u2019 vision of what is happening inside the box. The cube is a space in which bodies sweat, lose balance and fall because of the movement of the cube. A part of the project is intended for the spectators who enter the cube and adapt to the technological environment. Repnik himself within the cube enacts the performance in which he paints the dewy walls of the cube. The continually produced vapours keep erasing the images that Repnik is drawing and the spectator must retrace them time and again in her memory.     Repnik radically demonstrates that transitoriness is a characteristic not only of language and performing arts but also of visual arts. The outside of the cube functions as a lighthouse of sorts: it reflects the light and the images projected onto it, it returns the memories back to the place where they came from \u2013 to the gaze of the spectator. The spectator is thus put into the position of someone who projects something onto the artwork and the artist, but who in turn encounters precisely that which emanates from her gaze \u2013 the gaze itself. Aquart opens up one of the key questions of contemporary art \u2013 the question of positioning. The art of the twenty-first century cannot be positioned unproblematically within a certain field, discipline, territory or stylistic formation. The positioning of art nowadays needs to be understood in terms of transitions between liminal spaces. The materials, the methods of work and the logic of performance used in Aquart are manifestations of such transitions with all their pertaining intervals and pauses.     By Vlado G. Repnik Collaborators: Robert Klan\u010dnik, Stefan Doepner, Igor \u0160tromajer, Janko Mandi\u0107, Gorazd Borucky and Lana Katarina Gotvan with friends.

      "text":" HAURATON Channels at the new Regional Exhibition Ground     This is a first in HAURATON\u2019s nearly 50 year history: almost 5 km of drainage channels, which are to be integrated in a construction site. By the autumn of 2007 the new regional exhibition ground will open at the gates of the regional capital.     HAURATON has been involved with the project for the regional exhibition ground right from the start; the work with the planning office responsible for it started as early as the design phase. HAURATON put design proposals forward very early on, which were then developed step by step according to static and hydraulic requirements. The result was a harmonious drainage system comprising various products, which fulfils all the requirements of function and design.     The large surface areas and loading bays between the individual exhibition halls are drained mainly by FASERFIX SUPER 200 channels with galvanised GUGI iron mesh grating. They have a high hydraulic performance and keep all the water away from the buildings.     The lines of drains at the entrances to the halls are each enhanced with FASERFIX BIG SL 300. The way into the halls is at ground level over these areas. They are in frequent use and must withstand the highest of loads. FASERFIX BIG SL channels have edge protection of galvanised steel and are ideally suited to this field of installation. The GUGI iron mesh gratings with a nominal width of 300 mm ensure that no water can enter into the halls.     Artistic features are provided by lots of trees, which were planted in tree islands. FASERFIX SUPER KS channels 100 with galvanised mesh gratings are arranged around these tree islands so that dirty water cannot do any damage to the plants. "

      "text":" O projektu     My name is Bostjan Skrlj and my dream is to travel the world, crisscrossing as many countries as possible on my bike, a BMW GS 1200 Adventure. In August 2008 I left my home in Slovenia and set out on this journey. With no timeline, traveling overland on new and ancient roads, my trail unfolds daily ...     Bye bye Yukon and welcome to Alaska :) road between two Border was a disaster... if no one takes care of it...     Million deep holes covered with black ice, very easy to turn shine side down :) But studs have done their work !!!!     After a long ride first stop in Tok...camping overnight at -29.8\u00baC -21.64F     I had to be careful about Caribo and moose ...I have met a lot of them     The roads were covered with ice and snow as I expected...     Glacier     My friend Bob and Sharon Peek gave me a place to stay and place where i can work on my bike in Wasilla     Oil change for low temperature     0W-40 this oil is still liquid at -50 \u00baC -58F and engine start much easier     something for show :)     Screwing some extra studs for better traction...     is very nice to know someone who can help and support you...     the last check... Please note I do not use any heated clothing.     And here we go !!!!!     Prudhoe here we come !!!!!!     Wasilla - Fairbanks     I always try to find power to plug in my bike when camping     Beginning of Dalton Highway. Alaska State Troopers followed me for awhile to see if I was able to handle icy roads     very nice road for begin     The road are continually changing in surface texture. Had to be aware and focused at all times.     No mistakes allowed.     Arctic Circle... 310 mils to Prudhoe     Unwinding after a days travel with very interesting book from my friend (Miran Juvan\u010di\u010d)     From this point on the road is sprayed to make it smother for trucks     We're have left the boreal forest and moving up across the tundra     The nature is amazing so quite and beautiful cant explain with any words     The temperature is getting colder and road is a little rougher     Slowly making progress further north.     In February the days are still very short in the arctic     Everything that is electric is starting to shutdown, indicator on dashboard, GPS, temperature sensor.     Extremely cold, imagine what the windchill was. Thank goodness I had a better helmet this trip     Finally Deadhorse -31*     Low temperature makes everything very fragile, and we can lose some piece of equipment very easy     this is just the beginning     The life of working in Prudhoe, everything is plugged in and left running al night long.     Trucks are running 24\/7     Drilling Rig Base     Heating up machines to get them to run.     I prepared my bike for this expedition, I'm going to write a separate report on what I did to make this ride     a sucess     My bike has more then 10,000Km on extreme conditions and I expected this to happen. The shock has     more then 90,000 since the beginning of my trip.     In the beginning I was traveling with one other person and we carried a lot more luggage. On very rough     roads. The Ohlins did a great job for me , no complaints     This much oil dropped on the ground in Prudhoe could get a fine and a ticket, I found this out later.     I'm at the halfway point on this trip and only have part of my suspension working. Have to be very     careful going back     Because your are not able to camp in Deadhorse I had to use the hotel, but the price was not out of line     Because they gave you the meals at no additional cost. You can eat like a pig. HaHa     Bike started without any problem, thanks to good planning     General store in Deadhorse Alaska inside the have a wall of heros (pictures of people who have     driven motorcycles up here) But not that many in winter.

The premises at the northern bypass include a sports hall, a stadium, and a subterranean commercial facility with garages.     The centre\u2019s facility dedicated to commerce and parking is completely buried and has several storeys. It is divided into several dilatation units. Level +1.00 represents a green roof with a park. The commercial centre, delivery routes and part of parking places are located at level -6.00, parking places for personal vehicles are located at level -9.50, parking for buses and personal vehicles is located at level -13.00.     The commercial\/garage facility is designed as a partly prefabricated frame construction which is reinforced by concrete walls due to huge earthquake forces. The cover panel (the panel at benchmark +0.10 m) is 40 cm thick and subsequently tensioned with cables. Prefabricated columns from reinforced concrete are arranged in a grid of 8 x 12 m. Prefabricated omega beams extend in shorter direction between the columns and span a gap of 8.0 m. Prefabricated hollow pre-stressed panels which extend over the longer gap L=12 m abut on the prefabricated beams. The construction has a shallow foundation on individual footing and strip footing, while staircase cores and lift shafts are founded on foundation plates.

      "text":" The Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Koro\u0161ka (KGLU) is a museum of visual arts, focusing on the collection and study of art from the second half of the 20th century onwards. In addition to its exhibition and administrative spaces in the centre of Slovenj Gradec the Museum also oversees the programme of the Ravne Gallery, which is located in the Cultural Centre in Ravne na Koro\u0161kem.     The Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Koro\u0161ka was founded in 1957 as the Art Pavilion. Those initially responsible for the founding of the gallery and the organizers of the first exhibitions and lectures were members of the so-called Academic Group (established in 1954), comprised of architects Marjan Gnamu\u0161 and Mirko Zdovc, philologist Primo\u017e Simoniti and painter Karel Pe\u010dko. The group\u2019s work soon transformed into a formally established gallery, which was led by Karel Pe\u010dko from its founding to 1997.     Already in the 1960s the institution began organizing international exhibitions. In 1966, for the purposes of an ambitious international exhibition, the gallery was expanded and a new exhibition pavilion was built designed specifically for contemporary exhibition projects.     The Gallery\u2019s activities contributed significantly to a the creation of a specific identity of the city of Slovenj Gradec, which was granted the title of UN Messenger of Peace in 1989. Even today, the four large-scale international exhibitions (1966, 1975, 1979 and 1985) organized under the auspices of the United Nations Organization still well represent the mission of the gallery, as they provided the basis for the Museum\u2019s international collection, which carries even greater symbolic meaning in light of current events and developments today.     From the 1990s to the present, the gallery has expanded its work by enlarging the collection and developing the Museum staff\u2019s professional competence and expertise. Decisive steps have been taken towards developing a contemporary institution that manages its collection in accordance with high museum standards and practices and organizes relevant and engaging exhibitions together with other activities that reinforce interaction and cooperation with various audiences and actors.     In addition to its andragogical programs, the gallery has also developed a diverse pedagogical program for children of different age groups. The pedagogical program is especially recognizable for Berneker's creative workshops.     Today, the collection of the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Koro\u0161ka is made up of roughly 3000 works. The collection is comprised of works by many foreign and domestic artists and of special larger groups of collections, such as the collection of works by Jo\u017ee Tisnikar, which is supplemented by the collection Homage to Tisnikar \u2013 Homage combines works by Slovenian and foreign artists dealing with subject matter similar to that Tisnikar developed \u2013 and collections of works by Franc Berneker, Bogdan Bor\u010di\u0107, Valentin Oman, \u0160tedan Planinc and Pino Poggi.     The Museum also maintains the special collection that began during the exhibitions under the auspices of the United Nations between 1966 and 1985, which is comprised of international works of art that have a particularly contemporary and engaged position, such as those dealing with war, migration, social inequality and similar. Special attention is devoted to contemporary artistic production, particularly of those artists from the region as well as artists from across Slovenia. "

      "text":" Microangiopathic late complication Small and very small blood vessels are damaged mainly by elevated blood glucose levels over a longer period of time which leads to disorders in function and structure of the sensible endothelium. The endothelium gets thicker (sclerosis) and permeable which causes deposits of blood particles and proteins in the tissues disordering the function of the organs. Diabetic Retinopathy Micro capillaries in the retina of the eye are damaged. This late complication is the most common reason for blindness in the western part of the world. Please refer to Diabetic Retinopathy for further information. Diabetic Nephropathy Kidneys are important organs as maintaining the function of a filter for the human body but also as a regulator of the liquid balance including micro elements and influencing production of blood cells as well. If the kidneys are damaged due to poor metabolic control the filter effect is reduced. Please refer to Diabetic Nephropathy for further information. Diabetic Neuropathy This diabetic late complication results in a damage of the nerves. The reason for that is that nerve cells are under-nourished by blood vessels which are damaged due to the micro angiopathy. Strongly fluctuating blood glucose levels can also lead directly to damage of the nerve cells. One distinguishes a peripheric neuropathy disordering mainly long strains of nerves of the legs or arms from autonomic neuropathy where mainly inner organs or regulation of sweat production at the feet are influenced. Please refer to Diabetic Neuropathy for further information. Macro Angiopathy Damage of big blood vessels like carotid artery, aorta, coronary vessels or big blood vessels of the feet are concluded under this definition. This damage occurs together with atherosclerosis which progresses quickly and aggressively at diabetics. It has to be taken into consideration that in common with type 2 diabetes beside high blood glucose levels also a qualitative and quantitative metabolic disorder and hypertension mainly occur. The level of LDL cholesterol (\u201ethe bad cholesterol\u201c) is of high importance. LDL molecules of diabetics are particularly small and dense and can therefore easily penetrate in the walls of blood vessels, stay there and lead together with inflammation cells and calcium particles to so-called \u201cPlaques\u201d. These can lead to stenosis of the blood vessels. If they spontaneously burst by eliminating their content this could lead to an acute closure of the blood vessels by activating blood coagulation. Due to localisation of this closure this can result in a heart attack, stroke or reduction in circulation of the leg. In order to prevent this development it is important to optimize diabetes control (HbA1c < 7.0%) but also to minimize all other risk factors of atherosclerosis. That means lowering of blood pressure < 130\/80 mmHg, lowering of LDL cholesterol <100mg\/dl and elevating HDL levels (good cholesterol) to > 40mg\/dl for men and > 50mg\/dl for women. Another important factor is consumption of tobacco. Smoking and diabetes is a bad combination. Every diabetic should even reduce or better stop smoking. Medical regular checks (once a year) are a colour-coded Duplex Sonography of the brain vessels, the measurement of the circulation in the leg vessels and an EKG. Additionally hypertension patients should undergo an echocardiography and an ergometry. "

      "text":" Seminar iz kriptografije in teorije kodiranja - 6. okt. 2005     On Design and Security of Modern Stream Ciphers     Enes Pa\u0161ali\u0107     Povzetek:     In a modern society cryptology plays a fundamental role in many public services that demand privacy in data communication. Its wide range of use covers the services such as internet banking, mobile communication encryption, e-mail encryption ...., to name just a few. One huge subclass of cryptographic primitives consists of so called symmetric-key ciphers which in itself contains block ciphers and stream ciphers. These encryption schemes are used for a fast symmetric-key encryption, that is the same secret key is shared by the sender and receiver in a two-party communication. A few years ago, a new block cipher standard was adopted (Advanced Encryption Standard that uses the Rijndael encryption algorithm) as a replacement of the famous block cipher DES. Stream cipher encryption technique has not yet been standardized except of certain mobile applications such as GSM. Due to faster encryption when compared to block ciphers, this encryption method still remains attractive for fast encryption applications where a huge amount of data is to be encrypted. Also, some real-time applications such as encryption of streaming video sequence are preferably performed in an extremely fast fashion. In this talk we discuss general design strategies for modern stream cipher schemes. The security aspects of certain design approaches are illustrated. In the second part, the concept of algebraic attacks is treated in greater depth. These attacks, being a relatively new security threat, have in certain sense compromised the security of many encryption schemes that were believed to be cryptographically strong. "

Also, \u201cProjekt Lazarus\u201d is focused on the performance of works that are rarely performed as well as those that have not yet been recorded.     Brevis et facilis pslamorum, baroque revival from Hvar     Artists' message to visitors     European cultural heritage is a unique civilization and a historical treasure trove of scientific and artistic achievements, incomparable on a world scale. It is up to us to ensure that this richness of spirit is continually nourished, revived, and perpetuated as a pledge for the future, as a pledge for the coming generations. With this paradigm, the Projekt Lazarus seeks out the importance of cultural heritage of the late Renaissance and Baroque in the creation of a unique European identity, based on the foundation of humanism and enlightenment, on whose wings lies our European future.     About project     The research, revitalization, promotion and presentation of Croatian and European musical heritage are the primary objectives of the \u201cProjekt Lazarus\u201d which are being realized through two main processes; exploring yet undiscovered musical literature from 16thto 18th century in cooperation with experts for that period, and modelling professional ensemble necessary for the preparation and presentation of musical pieces. Also, \u201cProjekt Lazarus\u201d is focused on the performance of works that are rarely performed as well as those that have not yet been recorded.     Projekt Lazarus (HR)     On the Croatian music scene since 2013 operates a new professional ensemble called \u201cProjekt Lazarus\u201d, whose unusual name hides the main objective of this ensemble \u2013 the revitalization of Croatian musical heritage. \u201cProjekt Lazarus\u201d has been established within the association of Croatian Music Centre by initiator and founder of the ensemble bass Robert Pali\u0107, a member of the Opera of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb.     With the program Brevis et facilis psalmorum we will present the book of psalms of the Italian-Croatian composer Damjan Nembri, born in Hvar in 1584. The collection was published in Venice by Bartolomeo Magni in 1641. In addition to Nembri, we will present the motets from the collection Sacrae cantiones (1620) by Ivan Luka\u010di\u0107, the spiritual concerts from the collection Parnassia militia (1622) by Vinko Jeli\u0107 and one of the few preserved compositions by Ivan \u0160iben\u010danin Laudate pueri.     The collection Brevis et facilis psalmorum consists of six compositions: psalms Dixit Dominus (Psalm 110 (109)), Laudate pueri (Psalm 113 (112)), Laetatus sum (Psalm 122 (121)), Nisi Dominus (Psalm 127 (126)), Lauda Jerusalem (Psalm 147 (146-147) and Magnificant (Luke, 1, 46-55). It was published, according to the custom of the time, in five separate volumes: Cantus, Altus, Tenor, Bassus and Bassus pro Organo. The note on the cover stating that these were 'short and easy psalms' must be regarder in the context of the practice of church music in Venice at the beginning of Seicento, i.e. as a signal to the performing musicians that the compositions are, at least on the most obvious level, written in the late-renaissance style. The texts of Nembri\u2019s psalms however, do not belong to the narrow post-Tridentine and counter-reformational canon, which was also the case with the majority of psalms performed in Venice as well as other parts of the Croatian coast from Istria to Dubrovnik.     The 'short and easy psalms' concentrate musically on the striking and functional exchange of solo and tutti passages. A note entitled Avertimento a Lettori, printed at the end of each of the five volumes in the Collection, points out different possibilities for performing the psalms, as well as various musical solutions. From this note we can see that Nembri allowed his compositions to be performed in the more contemporary baroque style as well. The successive use of late-renaissance and baroque stylistic devices (the so-called stile misto, as it was called in the theory of music of that time) is akin to the techniques of early baroque composers active in Croatia (e.g. Ivan Luka\u010di\u0107, Tomaso Cecchini), the harmony reflects the style of Venetian church music of the second and third decades of the 17th century, and the structure shows the influence of Claudio Monteverdi and his vespers from the collection Sanctissimae Virgini Missa senis vocibus ad ecclesiarum choros ac Vesperae pluribus decantandae (Venice, 1610). Damjan Nembri was a master of polyphony, confident in handling complex harmonic situations, and his organ continuo is playful, demanding and inventive. The collection Brevis et facilis psalmorum is one of the most significant monuments of Croatian baroque music.

The building has 11 storeys, of that 4 basements, a ground floor and 6 floors. The building will serve a variety of purposes (garage, stores, hotel, and flats) and this variegation is also reflected in the design of the carrying construction.     Ljubljana is located on an area of moderate seismic hazard, this is why the construction has 7 strong reinforced-concrete cores. The vertical load is carried by reinforced-concrete columns arranged over a span of about 8 m in both directions. The building has two internal courtyards, one in the residential section and another one in the hotel. The residential internal courtyard, which has a grass and trees, is encircled by luxury flats separated by non-carrying suspended reinforced-concrete walls to provide for better sound insulation.     The construction pit protection will be carried out with a diaphragm wall with three truss slabs. The construction will be executed by using the \u201ctop-down\u201d method. The surface area of the construction pit amounts to 5,200 m2, the excavation is up to 15.7 m deep and located closely to the existing adjacent buildings.

      "text":" Messier Questions & Answers     This is not exactly what is an FAQ, although we try to answer all the most common questions related to Charles Messier and his catalog.     The question \"what telescope is needed\" must acurately be answered separately for every individual object: Some are visible to the naked eye, and few even under considerable bad conditions, but many other require some instrumentation. A 3-inch refractor (or equivalent) will manage the lot of them, but for the faintest objects of Messier's catalog, the present author would recommend a 4-inch refractor or equivalent; this will be sufficient to view them all, provided that the instrument is equipped so that both rich field\/low magnification and (considerably) high magnification\/small field observations are possible; otherwise you will perhaps miss some of the big, low surface brightness objects, especially M33, the Triangulum galaxy.     Most of today's amateur instruments, starting from 3.5 to 4 inch free aperture (unobstructed; about 4.5 to 5 inch Newtons), are superior to Messier's telescopes, but he had the advantage of a very dark and clear sky all the time when it was not cloudy over Paris. So the success of finding his objects may more depend on the choice of a good (dark) place than on superiority of instrumentation.     Although Messier called his list a \"Catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters\" (where we know today that some nebulae are actually galaxies), there are three objects that are neither:     M24 is a Milky Way star cloud which contains an 11th mag open cluster (NGC 6603). The NGC erroneously takes this cluster for M24, although Messier without doubt described the star cloud.     M40 is a double star which Messier found and measured when looking in vain for a non-existent nebula reported by 17th century observer Jan Hevelius (this answers the question why this object is included: Messier had logged the position, thus it got a number).     M73 is a group or an asterism of four 10th to 12th magnitude stars, which Messier measured at the same time when he determined M72's position.     Some versions of the list omit some or all of these dubious objects, though they are without doubt real objects, and their appearance was correctly described by Messier. However, these ``dubious'' objects can be hardly classified as deep sky objects at all: M40 and M73 are multiple stars (or asterisms), while M24 is perhaps no object at all, but a ``window in the dust\" obscurring the Milky Way (see the M24 page).     Missing Messier objects:     Of the 103 objects in the full printed version of Messier's catalog, only 99 show up as described at their position, while four objects are missing: M47, M48, M91, and M102. For at least three of these entries, the described objects exist, but Messier gave a wrong position, only the case of M102 is still controversially discussed. Look at the Discussion of the missing Messier objects.     Additional Messier objects:     From the studies of Messier's personal notes, publications, the text of the catalog, as well as the notes and correspondence of his friend Pierre Mechain, experts have added 7 more objects, numbers M104 to M110, to his catalog; these are the additional Messier objects.     Messier's catalog was not intended as a Deep Sky catalog at all, but as a list of nebulae which can easily fool comet hunters by looking like comets. Thus it contains mainly objects which, at least in the rather small instruments Messier has used, or to the unaided eye, look like comets. Moreover, Messier did a more or less unsystematic search for comets, and thus it depended on chance to a good part if he found a particular object.     This one is easy: Because Messier did all his observations from Paris, which is at 49 degrees northern latitude.     Because usually, Messier did not include objects which resemble a comet so bad as the famous cluster. This leads to the question why he included the Orion Nebula, the Pleiades, and Praesepe. Those were included in one night, that of March 4, 1769, the only night when Messier made an exception. This night, however, falls into a season when the Double Cluster is worst observable, i.e. over horizon all the day. Otherwise, the two clusters would probably have been assigned Messier numbers 46 and 47 !     One may of course ask: Why did he make this exception at all ? Or: Why did he never again include such brighter objects ? As we cannot ask Charles Messier himself, we can no more find out if there is a deeper reason, but probably it is not.     The prime reason may be chance, another reason may be that comets occur more frequently in low ecliptic latitudes, a fact Messier was probably aware. So he was not looking exactly near the ecliptical pole, where the Cat Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is situated.     Messier scanned the region of this object when he was looking for a non-existing nebula reported by the 17th century astronomer Johann Hevelius (who had reported few real and several nonexistent nebulae). He ended up in the assumption that his object M40 (today also known as Winnecke 4) was the binary which Hevelius had erroneously seen as nebulous. It seems however that Hevelius had observed another (nearby) double star, 74 Ursae Maioris.     It is somewhat unusual that the Orion Nebula M42 together with M43 and the bright star clusters Praesepe M44 and the Pleiades M45 have found their way into Messiers list; Charles Messier usually only included fainter objects which could be easily taken for comets (this is one reason why the Double Cluster Chi and h Persei is not in Messier's catalog). But in this one night of March 4, 1769, he determined the positions of these wellknown objects (to say it with Owen Gingerich) `evidently adding these as \"frosting\" to bring the list to 45', for its first publication in the Memoires de l'Academie (see also the remark at M42).     Interested readers may ask themselves why it was important for him to have his list at 45 rather than 41 objects. One can only speculate on this subject, but perhaps one answer may be that Lacaille's catalog of 1755 happened to contain 42 entries, and he wanted to beat this number.     One may now ask: Why did he think, in another night, the Andromeda galaxy M31 should be in his list ? You can guess the answer: This object may be easily taken for a fainter (4th mag) comet, even with the naked eye (this may be one of the reasons that it was not cataloged in ancient times, because it was thought to be transient like comets, and as them, regarded as an atmospheric, not astronomical phenomenon).     This is another case of a position measurement, which in this case was determined simultaneously with that of globular cluster M72. The small group of four stars got the number M73.     First, after the catalog was submitted for publication, he added one more object more or less immediately, the Sombrero galaxy M104 (May 1781). Parallel to and after that, he was apparently busy in observing and calculating the orbit of Herschel's newly discovered planet, Uranus. Later that year, he had his awful accident by falling into an ice cellar, which stoke him to bed for more than a year. When he resumed observing in 1782, he observed a transit of Mercury, and took up comet hunting virtually immediately. But never again he extended his catalog of nebulous objects. It is not improbable that one decisive reason was that now Herschel had begun his systematical search for nebulae with much more powerful equipment and soon discovered thousands of objects, so that Messier with his small instuments realized that he could no more compete, and lost interest.     Many years later, in 1801, he claimed that he had plans to rearrange his list, and add more recently observed objects, but this plan never became reality.     The Messier Marathon is a term describing the attempt to find as many Messier objects as possible in one night. The opportunity to find all objects is given for (and limited to) observers in rather low northern latitudes in late March of each year, when the Moon is near its new phase; otherwise you are restricted to find as much as possible, but cannot find all of them in one night. As this is quite a challenging endeavor for skilled amateur observers, these pages provide a Messier Marathon section.     M45, the Pleiades; however, this cluster is associated with nebulae which have NGC numbers     M24, the Milky Way Patch in Sagittarius; it contains however the 11th magnitude cluster NGC 6603 which is sometimes erroneously listed as M24     This is one of the most frequently asked questions .. well, SEDS and me don't provide any hardcopies of our materials. However, you may get images of many of the Messier objects in the form of slides, prints, posters, and more, from many suppliers of astronomical goodies, and e.g. several book dealers. You may find some information in my \" List of Observatories Making Astrophotos Publicly Available\"; many of the sources listed there have Messier object materials.

SEDS and me do not restrict any appropriate usage of these materials, but in many cases, there are third-party royalties which are to be observed, especially in case of any for-profit usage.     Best you can do is send email to the author of the questions (Hartmut Frommert) and ask your question. There's a good chance that it is interesting enough for being added to this list.     The maintainer of the pages appreciates any form of constructive feedback, from simple comments (\"this is fine\" or \"that may be better another way\", or equally: \"that's bad\") to any form of contributions, and reports of any errors.

September 2013     Protey Temen was born in 1984 in Moscow and has been creating and designing for most of his life. Over the last 8 years he has been working in a field that covers design as well as art. He studied at the Art and Production Department of the Humanitarian Institute of Television and Radio for a year (2011) and then transferred to the International Institute of Advertising, specialising in art direction, where he graduated in 2006. He joined ZungeDesign Studio in 2004 and was promoted to Art Director in 2004. He has worked freelance since 2008. The following year, he launched an art project group called Krovi with Dima Kavko. In 2010, the group won the Bronze Prize at the European Design Awards for the project Dollars and Rozes. His current work is marked by the on-going project Abstract Identity, which is supplied by various workshops, publications and exhibitions.     This exhibition will showcase posters and prints which the author has designed especially for this occasion. The concept of his work is best described as abstract identity, workaday spectacularity. Extremes such as body and spirit, artificial and natural, real and abstract are confronted in his work, producing a spark in their collision. The dialogue between these two extremes grows by itself, and is compared by the author to \"growing flesh on the carcass\". That carcass becomes a framework, peeped in the environment, taken out of context. To be able to provide acute attention to each subject, the use of language of abstraction seems appropriate. Flexible, vibrant and absorbing new meanings taken out of context. As a result, we obtain artefacts of these events. A chronicle documenting itself.

      "text":" European Projects     EU-funded projects involving the Ljubljana Puppet Theatre: Contemporary Puppetry Critical Platform, Mapping, NAPP, Puppets & Design, Connect Up, Under-the-Radar Backstage Theatre Jobs 3 and Shock Brigades     Contemporary Puppetry Critical Platform     Coordinator: Lutkovno gledali\u0161\u010de Ljubljana (SI), partners: Puppet Animation Scotland (UK), Sveuciliste Josipa Jurja Strossmayera u Osijeku, Akademija za umjetnost i kulturu u Osijeku (HR), Vilniaus Teatras Lele (LT),     The project is focused in the field of reflexion on contemporary puppetry - in education of new generation of critics. 4 partners of the project are building new web platform that would enable exchange of information, informal education and distribution of relevant news in our field of work. We would like this platform to go across borders of our partnership and also that it would become permanent.     By exploring the potential reach of contemporary puppetry the four partners will contribute to the development of an artistic field and through the professional discourse release it from the preconception the general public has, that it is an art form for children, an inferior art form. In the frame of this project the partners will get a chance to systematically nurture a specific segment of puppetry critic and reflection and foremost they will devote special and systematic efforts to introduce a specific audience groups to contemporary puppetry. A great deal of project activities is centered on audience engagement devised to enable and encourage the audience to engage in peer-to-peer dialog, provide them with the opportunities to process their own responses alongside other people\u2019s, enhance their knowledge, theoretical background, improve their articulation skills, broaden their understanding of contemporary puppetry, increase audience members\u2019 engagement in and enjoyment of the contemporary art events. By doing that we will deepen, broaden and sustain relationships with and between our audiences.     Mapping     Mapping is an artistic research project focused on creating a sensory-based relationship with very young children, from 0 to 6 years, through performing arts. In particular, it explores the idea of \u201cchildren-spectators of today and not only of tomorrow\u201d.     Children, especially the youngest ones, are \u201cnew subjects of the world\u201d, they are still discovering it, as much as they are discovering themselves. They have not established specific classification criteria yet, but they perceive what is aesthetic at any level of representation.     By observing them, we can detect the signs, the aesthetic moments experienced by the children in contact with artistic proposals, when they are \u201cextremely sensitive\u201d, that means in harmony with what they perceive.     NAPP     Numeric\u2019s Art Puppetry Project N.A.P.P project gather 4 recognized European in the field of puppetry arts :     Lutkovno Gledalisce Ljubljana - Slovenia.     Festival Mondial des Th\u00e9\u00e2tres de Marionnettes, Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res - France.     Teatrul Tony Bulandra, Targoviste - Romania.     Le Centre de la Marionnette de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Wallonie-Bruxelles, Tournai - Belgium.     Puppetry is well represented in terms of heritage, research and contemporary creation. Digital arts are now a priority. Puppetry arts and digital arts can meet but it is still quite rare and restrictive.     Puppets & Design     Objects are all around us every day. They can be useful, or beautiful. We often use them in a careless and automatic way. About 1 century ago with the rise of contemporary Design, objects became an expression of social imaginary, material shapes of the Zeitgeist as well as of the views of their designer: a vehicle of culture. Thanks to the intuition of a specific branch of puppetry, which we will call \u201cObject & Figure Theatre\u201d, objects can also be storytellers. They thus transcend their material and utilitarian dimension to earn a soul, a life, a destiny of their own.     The Puppets & Design project (P&D) aims to emancipate everyday objects from their utilitarian feature, instead lifting them up to the role of meaning and artistic expression conveyers, communication and intercultural dialogue tools. P&D will interweave the paths of puppet theater artists and of designers. The designers\u2019 competence can help puppetry to renew itself; puppetry and object animation will help designers to rethink objects and give them a soul by giving them specific shapes. P&D will innovate the Puppetry practice and increase its popularity with adults, children, families, schools by cross-fertilization with design practitioners (professional designers, scholars, students) through a set of cultural, educational and promotional EU activities.     ConnetcUp     ConnectUp sets in place an international cultural initiative for the target group 12+ in order to counteract the process of increasing social and cultural division across Europe. To achieve the aim of cultural inclusion it is essential to provide opportunities for young people to actively engage with different nationalities, cultures and social groups and to remain open to other people and life experiences. The partners believe that this is the only way the young people can perceive and understand the positive potential of living and working in partnership and in shared responsibility within a global society.     10 theatres with different artistic expertise, 9 festivals and 2 universities, working in the field of Theatre for Young Audiences, combine their different skills in a European \u201cunion of diversity\u201d and plan a major investment in Audience Development. Following Nelson Mandela\u2019s quote \u00bbNo one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his background or his religion...\u00ab the theatres and festivals aim to reach the cross section of society at least within their auditoriums by bringing together existing middle-class audiences with audiences from the margin of the society.

      "text":" The Kingdom of Tonga and its people     Slovenians like to complain when a postcard from Rome to Ljubljana first goes through Bratislava. How in the world can postmen mistake our little country below Triglav for Slovakia? Maybe it will provide some relief to know that we\u2019re not the only nation with this problem and that we should in fact be happy that the post intended for us remains on the same continent. Somewhere in the middle of the Pacific, between the Cook Islands and Fiji, there is a small kingdom that not many people have heard about. So it often happens that a letter sent by a lady in Los Angeles to her parents in Tonga first travels to the other side of the world, to African Togo.     The Kingdom of Tonga is the only South Pacific country that has never been colonised and it shows. It has remained pristinely Polynesian, which is interesting for tourists (admittedly few), and an endless source of frustration for those who move there and try to create something. Bureaucracy is extremely inefficient, public services are terrible and entrepreneurialism is truly rare. It seems to me that they mostly lack vision, which is why their decisions are often very short-sighted.     Of all the people from the Pacific region I\u2019ve met so far, Tongans are the most reserved. They\u2019re very kind, like all Polynesians, but it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re not used to being in contact with people different from them. It\u2019s very hard to form deeper friendship bonds with them. After initial failed attempts I have accepted the fact that they see us as \u201cpalangi\u201d (white people) from another planet and just want to keep a safe distance.     Tonga also differs from its neighbours in terms of economy. There is very little money on these islands. People grow taro and cassava, and fish, and for big holidays they slaughter one of the many pigs who roam freely around gardens and beaches.     The main source of income are in fact the Tongans who have emigrated and work in New Zealand or Australia and regularly send money to their families. For all public projects, from building schools and hospitals to help in natural disasters, Tonga is dependent on other countries.     Despite economic problems, the Tongans are happy people. They like celebrations (and they make a special effort when the king comes to visit), they socialise a lot and smile.     Only on Sundays is everything quiet. Tongans are very religious and the Lord\u2019s day is\u2014also by law\u2014intended only for rest. All types of work are strictly forbidden, including sports activities. An acquaintance even had problems because he was caught on a bicycle on a Sunday! Some people complain (for example the owners of diving centres, who lose one day\u2019s worth of profit), but I in fact quite like being forced to do nothing one day a week.     Tonga is an ideal destination for those who need a break because there's not much to do but lie on the beach. But, as a matter of fact, it\u2019s best to visit it with a sailboat, either your own or a charter one. By far the most beautiful face of Tonga are its numerous uninhabited dreamy islands that we can have just to ourselves for a day or two.     Jasna Tuta     I have always had a connection to the sea. Born in the coastal village of Sistiana (near Trieste) in northern Italy, my earliest memories are of watching the heavy waves slam ashore when the local winds were blowing hard. As a teenager, the sailing club became my focus \u2013 not just for my love of water sports, but also for the handsome boys that sailed there. I went on to become an Optimist instructor for the club by summer and a junior school teacher by winter. However, ten years of focusing on the needs of children dampened my maternal instincts somewhat and I felt the need to travel. The sea was the obvious way to go\u2026 "

On May 10, KVAN Consulting CEO Svyatoslav Biryulin will again give a lecture at the International Business School, Ljubljana (Slovenia). Cooperation with IBS becomes permanent. This time the theme of Svyatoslav\u2019s speech will be \u201cChange management. Strategy in a changing world\u201d.     Blog articles     When I start the first conversation with a prospect, a potential customer, I always ask them: who are your clients? And often I hear something like this: \u201cwe work in the B2B market, so our customers are industrial (or trade, retail, logistic, etc.) companies\u201d. This approach is extremely dangerous. There are no \u201cfirms\u201d or \u201ccompanies\u201d.\u2026 read more     Peter Drucker (who, by the way, called himself an \u201cinsultant\u201d rather than a \u201cconsultant\u201d) liked to ask people: \u201cWhy does a business exist?\u201d. And if he heard an answer: \u201ca business exists for the sake of the net profit,\u201d he concluded: \u201cYou know nothing about business\u201d.

      "text":" Europe in Short, Section 2     18. 11. 2019     A Q&A with Bogdan Muresanu, director of The Christmas Gift, was conducted by Peter Cerov\u0161ek and Matev\u017e Jerman after the second part of the Europe in Short section. Before venturing into filmmaking, the director did a six-month stint as a scriptwriter. The moderators complimented the brilliant script with subtly increasing suspense. Muresanu reflected on the topic for quite some time before writing the screenplay in two or three days, describing the creative process as a \u201clong, but planned outburst\u201d. He believes retrospection, that is, a review of the past, informs our understanding of both the present and the future, and sees history as narration. According to Muresanu, it takes a lot of courage to look in the mirror. The anti-Communist insurgency that overthrew Ceau\u0219escu was not a real revolution, but this is not evident in the film. The Christmas Gift is a blend of inspiration and Romanian New Wave, in addition to reflecting the influence of Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s No, which depicts the insurrection against dictator Pinochet (incidentally, Larra\u00edn is featured at this year\u2019s Liffe with Ema). The camera imitated safety cameras, and archival footage was used. While forty young actors were auditioned for the role of the boy writing a wish letter to Santa, Luca Toma was the most convincing candidate because he was the only one with \u201csadness in his eyes.\u201d This is because the film does not actually deal with the last Communist president of Romania but examines the concept of fear over a certain period. It took the crew six months to decide on the closing credits theme. They chose an optimistic Communist song to provide a marked contrast to the counter-revolutionary events in 1989. In concluding, the director talked about the difficulty of explaining history to the boy-actor because he had long been unable to understand it himself. "

      "text":" Abstract Submission CLOSED Acceptance note July 1 Reduced early payment fee July 15     Dynamic treatment regimes as a prediction problem     Elja Arjas University of Helsinki and University of Oslo     Adequate medical treatment of many diseases, including different types of cancer, involves a sequence of treatment assignments over time. For an optimal allocation, each assignment of a new treatment should be allowed to depend adaptively on how the patient responded to the ones that were administered previously. The task of establishing a close-to-optimal dynamic treatment regime of this type for patients with different individual characteristics, based on the accrued follow-up information, offers several challenges which are both conceptual and technical. The purpose of this talk is to consider their solution from a Bayesian perspective, by combining tools from constrained nonparametric modeling of stochastic processes and their inference, and the consequent predictive distributions, with dynamic programming for establishing the optimum. While the ideas underlying this approach are general, practical considerations will often restrict their direct applicability, and require that certain simplifying assumptions in the modeling are employed. An example based on HIV data is considered as an illustration. "

The event will feature an introductive session with official presentation from European Delegates, then dedicated sessions focusing on business and regulatory perspectives, technical concepts and solutions, and standardization and exploitation roadmaps. Participation to the day programme of the workshop is free of charge, but prior registration is required.     The purpose of this conference is to facilitate the exchange of ideas on the topic of computational creativity in a cross-disciplinary setting. It will bring together people from AI, Cognitive Science and related areas such as Psychology, Philosophy and the Arts who research questions related to the notion of creativity as it relates to computational systems. This focus on creativity in the context of computational systems has the potential for increasing innovation in existing fields of research as well as for defining new fields of study.     Israel's Nobel winner: People called me a dreamer Israeli scientist Ada Yonath, a leading researcher in the structural biology field, was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday, the Nobel committee in Stockholm announced.     The European Commission today called on Europe's information and communication technologies (ICT) industry to outline by 2011 the practical steps it will take to become 20% more energy efficient by 2015. ICT equipment and services alone account for about 8% of electrical power used in the EU and about 2% of carbon emissions. But using ICT in a smart way could help reducing energy consumption in energy-hungry sectors such as buildings, transport and logistics, and save 15% in total carbon emissions by 2020. The Commission recommends that the ICT sector adopts bold energy efficiency targets by 2011. It also asks EU countries to agree on common specifications for smart metering by the end of 2010.     This event will cover topics such as the European Digital Agenda for 2020; the EU Telecoms Framework Review; copyright; Commission state aid proposals; developments in next generation access policy; regulating in a bundled environment and the digital dividend. Workshops will also focus on data protection, state aid, net neutrality and telecoms issues in Eastern Europe.     Creativity plays an important role in developing intelligent computational systems, it is less clear how to model, simulate, or evaluate creativity in such systems. In other words, it is often easier to recognize the presence and effect of creativity than to describe or prescribe it. The purpose of this conference is to facilitate the exchange of ideas on the topic of computational creativity in a cross-disciplinary setting.     The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. Presenters are leaders in their respective fields, representing industrial, academic and government communities. Leading researchers present their current work, while special sessions focus on the role of women in today's technology fields, including computer science, information technology, research and engineering. Past Grace Hopper Celebrations have resulted in collaborative proposals, networking, mentoring, and increased visibility for the contributions of women in computing.     Two EU-funded projects, ICT-WEB-PROMS and WINS-ICT are jointly organising a \"Training and networking workshop for WB-EU research cooperation in ICT for Learning and eLearning\". The workshop will be organised in the frame of the international event \"4th Balkan Conference in Informatics-BCI 2009\" in Thessaloniki, Greece on 18 September, 2009. Draft agenda of the workshop.     In the midst of the economic crisis, the ICT sector is still growing! It is now the time to prepare for the future and ensure that when the crisis is over, the sector will have the necessary resources to respond to new challenges. At end of the mandate of Commissioner Reding, this gender workshop aims to take stock of the progress made and present new initiatives and actions. Brainstorming sessions are also organised to work towards setting up a new agenda for Women in ICT. Commissioner Reding will launch the Directory of Women in ICT, and interactive platform which brings together all relevant initiatives and information as well as provides a European network of women in the sector. The Commissioner will also present the new signatories of The Code of Best Practices for women in ICT. Participation in the Workshop is free of charge but there is a limited number of places. "

      "text":" News     Next month (10-11.7.21) we are organizing a 48-hours hackaton with the aim to co-create knowledge and expand our collaborative networks in marine biotechnology. Everyone is invited, regardless of their seniority level or field of expertise. The ocean is vast, so the expertise needed to sustainably valorize it should cover everything, from biology to legal aspects. We are also kindly inviting you to spread the word among your colleagues, peers and students. There will be prizes and opportunities to write future joint publications and prepare for the future Horizon EU (and other) calls. Pass this invitation to any colleagues that might be interested in participating! Registration links are provided at the end of this message.     Oceans and seas cover more than 70% of the Earth and deliver multiple ecosystem services, including some that shape human societies (e.g., food provision, climate regulation). Marine assets represent the 7th largest economy in the world. Sustainable management of the oceans and seas is, therefore, essential. Yet, their protection lags far behind that of terrestrial habitats.     From April 12-14, 2021, the online conference \"International Conference on Marine Data and Information Systems\" IMDIS 2021 will be held, with the participation of Marine Biological Station Piran of National Institute of Biology. NIB -MBS is a partner in the SeaDataCloud project, which is one of the organizers of the conference.     We invite you to read the latest news from HarmoNIA (Harmonization and Networking for contaminant assessment in the Ionian and Adriatic Seas) Project, which has officially ended on 30 June 2020.     \u00bbFrom good data to good decisions: knowledge sharing for harmonized policies on contamination issues in the ADRION seas. From monitoring to risk assessment\u00ab     You are invited to the day of open doors of the Marine biology station Piran, National institute of biology.     In case of a small number of applications, the organizer reserves the right to change the program.     The Matlab scripts for the initial dilution were translated to work also in Octave, the free software available at https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/octave\/, which you may easily install on your computer.     Octave scripts for the initial dilution of polluted water are available here, which need to be put in the folder that is noted by Octave. In the Octave command window one needs only to run the script by typing \"run splinmat\".     Prof. dr. Vlado Mala\u010di\u010d from Marine Biological Station Piran of the National Institute of Biology has been involved in research of the dilution of fecal contaminated meteoric water from municipal discharges into the sea for more than 20 years. In this regard, several reports have been written, as well as articles in reputable international journals. Prof. dr. Mala\u010di\u010d also developed a computer program that calculates such dilution.     You can get the source code of the program in Matlab, the data required for it, and the reports and articles related to dilution at the following link.     From 25\u201327 November, 2019 the European COST Action \u201cOcean Governance for Sustainability \u2013 Challenges, Options and the Role of Science\u201d (CA15217) gathers for their 4th International conference in the coastal city of Piran, Slovenia. The conference is hosted by the National Institute of Biology (NIB) under the coordination of the Local Organiser Valentina Turk, Alenka Malej, and Jerneja Penca, who are excited to welcome around 55 participants from 29 countries from science and politics discussing the future of our oceans during a variety of scientific workshops and lectures.     Project HarmoNIA has reached its first milestone ! One step closer to sharing harmonized data and information on marine contaminants in the Adriatic & Ionian Seas. "

McLuhanove hipoteze, ugotovitve in opazke so najbolj aktualizirali mlaj\u0161i teoretiki, saj so jih postavili v sodobnej\u0161e medijske kontekste, jih modificirali in nadgradili. Toda medtem ko se dela McLuhana ka\u017eejo kot izrazito ambivalentna in zato odprta za najrazli\u010dnej\u0161e interpretacije, razlage in razumevanja, je pogled me dijske teoreti\u010darke in pisateljice Kathrin R\u00f6ggla nedvoumno pesimisti\u010den, kar postane \u0161e posebej o\u010ditno v njeni radijski igri in tudi v proznem besedilu die alarmbereiten. Primerjava McLuhanovih razlag in pogledov Kathrin R\u00f6ggla je pokazala, da obstaja med njimi precej\u0161nja stopnja strinjanja glede subjekta potro\u0161ni\u0161tva, komercialnega interesa vladajo\u010dih, igre vlog, simulakra, postdemokracije in resignacije \u2013 in to kljub dejstvu, da se R\u00f6ggla nikoli ne sklicuje na McLuhanova dela neposredno. Antiutopi\u010dni del McLuhanovih napovedi je tudi dobro realiziran v avtori\u010dinem nazoru (Weltanschauung), ki se nevede nahaja znotraj polja McLuhanovih razlag.

Povzetek: V \u010dlanku je predstavljen pregled motenj tikov in empiri\u010dno utemeljenih kognitivno-vedenjskih tehnik za neposredno zmanj\u0161evanje tikov ter u\u010denje u\u010dinkovitih strategij spoprijemanja z neugodnimi psihosocialnimi posledicami tikov pri otrocih in mladostnikih. V prvem delu so opisani tiki in motnje tikov, epidemiolo\u0161ki podatki o motnji tikov, potek motnje, pridru\u017eene te\u017eave in psihosocialne posledice tikov, na\u010dini ocenjevanja ter indikacije za zdravljenje. V drugem delu so skladno s klini\u010dnimi smernicami za obravnavo motenj tikov predstavljene kognitivno-vedenjske metode njihovega zdravljenja. Podrobneje so opisane psihoedukacija ter najbolj prou\u010devani in z empiri\u010dnimi dokazi podprti vedenjski tehniki, u\u010denje nadomestnega odziva in izpostavljanje s prepre\u010devanjem odziva, ki sta namenjeni neposrednemu zmanj\u0161evanju tikov. Navedeni so izsledki empiri\u010dnih raziskav, ki potrjujejo njihovo u\u010dinkovitost. V \u010dlanku so predstavljene tudi druge kognitivno-vedenjske tehnike, namenjene spoprijemanju z neugodnimi psihosocialnimi posledicami tikov in pridru\u017eenih te\u017eav. \u010clanek je sklenjen z opisom zahtev za izvedbo u\u010dinkovite kognitivno-vedenjske terapije pri otrocih in mladostnikih s tiki ter razmi\u0161ljanjem o na\u010dinih, s katerimi bi lahko raz\u0161irili znanje o specifi\u010dnih terapevtskih pristopih za obravnavo otrok in mladostnikov s tiki med kognitivno-vedenjskimi terapevti v Sloveniji.

      "text":" Social Networking Management A social networking service is an online service, platform, or site that focuses on facilitating the building of social networks or social relations among people who, for example, share interests, activities, backgrounds, or real-life connections. A social network service consists of a representation of each user (often a profile), his\/her social links, and a variety of additional services. Most social network services are web-based and provide means for users to interact over the Internet, such as e-mail and instant messaging. Online community services are sometimes considered as a social network service, though in a broader sense, social network service usually means an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered. Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual networks.     Since their introduction, social network sites (SNSs) such as MySpace, Facebook, Cyworld, and Bebo have attracted millions of users, many of whom have integrated these sites into their daily practices. As of this writing, there are hundreds of SNSs, with various technological affordances, supporting a wide range of interests and practices.     While their key technological features are fairly consistent, the cultures that emerge around SNSs are varied. Most sites support the maintenance of pre-existing social networks, but others help strangers connect based on shared interests, political views, or activities. Some sites cater to diverse audiences, while others attract people based on common language or shared racial, sexual, religious, or nationality-based identities. Sites also vary in the extent to which they incorporate new information and communication tools, such as mobile connectivity, blogging, and photo\/video-sharing. "

New website: http:\/\/au.ung.si\/en     Domov \/ HiLoVv - Hidden Live(r)s of Venice on Video     HiLoVv - Hidden Live(r)s of Venice on Video     After two months of research-based script development about the \"Hidden LIve(r)s of Venice\", on November 21 2011 students from three universities and several countries met in the floating city to produce 6 short documentaries about Venice, its interesting professions and personalities..., all under the mentorship of the renowned film director, professor Rajko Grli\u0107. The films were first shown at the end of the workshop with the presence of the portrayed persons at the University of Nova Gorica premises in Venice, at the ex Convento dei Servi di Maria, Sant\u2019Elena, while the final versions premiered at the screening in Ljubljana within the University of Nova Gorica School of Arts semester show on January 10 2012. The films are now in finalization for distribution.     HiLoVv Project Background     We will take a look at Venice from a different perspective, filter it through academic research and documentary film production. Students and mentors from three universities join to make 5 short documentaries about Venice, its people, their lives, the water...     The (Erasmus Intensive) programme under the title\"Hidden Live(r)s of Veniceon Video\"(HiLoVV) intends to revive the invisible and peripheral actors and narratives of a seemingly decaying urban tissue \u2013 Venice. By discovering the city\u2019s inner life through academic research and audio-visual representation of urban spaces, and through creative interactions with its everyday inhabitants, teachers and students are going to develop specific skills and knowledge within the interdisciplinary combined thematic areas of audiovisual techniques and (multi)media production, historical and (urban) archaeology, including cultural as well as social studies. Besides giving a unique and novel intercultural and interdisciplinary academic experience to the primary users, the secondary-user-centred aim of the project is to eventually offer a \"social catharsis through video\" to the immediate (academic and non-academic) audiences by featuring the 5 films (as major creative outputs) on site, regionally, and perhaps even globally. Contrasting the \u201chi\u201d and the \u201clow\u201d research and production paradigms \u2013 somewhat mirroring the two disparate layers of Venice\u2019s social reality \u2013 the specific pedagogical objective is to develop the key competence of a future film artist or video producer: to focus on small people as filters (the \u201cliver\u201d metaphor!) and carriers of \u201chidden\u201d narratives, discovering Venice (repeatedly anew) \u2013 or indeed any other \u201chistorically marked\u201d urban space \u2013 as a living urban tissue, reaching far beyond a mere historical scenery, a tourist landmark or a cultural business setting. In a broader project objective, the IP is to present a strong case of research-based media-production didactics, with a strong public impact and an innovative interdisciplinary outreach and strong ICT-based (blended) approach. The primary target groups of the programme include students, teachers and mentors, but also architects, urban sociologists, historians, conservators, and related (interdisciplinary oriented) scholars. Thesecondary target groups spread out onto all temporary as well as stationary urban inhabitants and \u201cusers\u201d of Venice, as well as the regional and trans-regional (global) public, reached via the distribution of the produced films.The main activities of the programme revolve around the gradual (didactically dissected) process of filmic video-production, supported by analytic remote as well as on-site research (urban sociology, architecture and history) as well as including manifold interactions with local inhabitants and other \u201cusers\u201d of the city. An important part of the project focuses around the dissemination activities covering on-site as well as trans-regional screenings and (exploitation-motivated) discussions, as well as fostering academic and non-academic (socially divergent) discourse on-site and on-line. The main learning outcomes envision students to: (specifically) - learn to research and produce in realistic and site-specific media production setting - master film and video production in blended (remotely connected) settings - develop site-specific preproduction, production and postproduction methods and work-styles in the realm of film and video production - develop a critical and (post)modern sociological perspective on cultural heritage, architecture and urbanism (generally) - develop interdisciplinary collaboration skills and team work ethics - learn to creatively collaborate trans-disciplinary, trans-culturally and via ICT - develop interdisciplinary competence in creative production settings - develop intercultural and interdisciplinary discursive competence Expected project outputs are: > 5 items of 7-10 minute short films of significant conceptual and aesthetic value (at least 2 promoted to international festivals and platforms), Supported by - 2 internal screenings on site (Venice) - 1 public screening on site (in Venice, with discussion) - 3 off-site screenings at partner universities (Graz, Rijeka, Ljubljana) - 3 international conference reports or presentations (at least one local) - 9 secondary screenings across the region (partner networks, festivals) - Intensive web dissemination (feature presentations ePlatform vsu.ung.si ) > new course curriculum, incl. complete instructional design and methodology > teaching & learning materials compendium (paper & online materials) > e-newsletter and press releases > 3international conference reports or presentations > a \u201cLessons Learned\u201d report Consortium partners: School of Arts University of Nova Gorica Academy of Applied Arts University of Rijeka Contemporary Arts Institute, Architecture and Media Institute, Graz Technical University "

      "text":" Aplication for information support ERP implementation projects     Abstract     This thesis first presents the importance of an ERP system for an individual company. The most common modules of this type of system and the process of their implementation within a company are then described. Because an implementation project may be very extensive and demanding, this thesis presents an application that supports ERP System implementation projects by providing better oversight. The application is accessible on the Internet and, depending on the level of the user, displays different data content on project development. The application stores all project data in one place, enabling management supervision over activities being carried out while ensuring project participants always remain precisely aware of their next task as well as of the deadline by which the task must be completed. In addition, the application stores all meeting minutes and records of other activities. In this way, the application assists in minimizing complications that could arise during project implementation as a result of a project participant not being aware of existing agreements, of his or her responsibilities or of the deadlines by which tasks must be completed.     Item Type:     Thesis (EngD thesis)     Keywords:     ERP system implementation, web application, IT project support "

Organizing surveys in folders     List of all created surveys positioned in 'My surveys' directory can be organized in folders, which is especially useful for users with larger number of surveys. To view surveys in folders, advanced interface has to be switched off; this can be set in the 'My Survey' \u2013 'Settings' \u2013 'User settings' tab.     Folders are displayed or hidden with click on Folder button, positioned on right side. Under the Create Survey button the Create new folder button will appear.     In the interface for creating survey 'My surveys' \u2013 'Create Survey', in the Basic Info part you can determine the folder in which the survey will be stored. The latter is possible only in the case of enabled storing in folders and subfolders (in the directory 'My Survey' click on the right button Folders).     You can also add the survey to the folder during the survey editing, this can be done in the section 'EDIT' \u2013 'Settings' \u2013 'Basic settings', where you can determine the folder you want in 'Basic info'.     Surveys, which are not in any of specifically selected folder, will appear in the last folder on the list, named 'Unallocated survey'. Other folders are arranged alphabetically.     Folders can:     be renamed, by clicking on it;     be moved, by dragging and dropping on selected place;     contain subfolders that you create by clicking on a blue plus sign next to the existing folder;     be deleted, by clicking on an orange minus sign next to the folder. If you delete folder with surveys, surveys will not be deleted; they will only be rearranged in the 'Unallocated survey' folder.     Functionality is intended solely for the administrative organization to increase transparency of the surveys and does not affect surveys themselves. "

jasn\u00fd, studen\u00fd dubnov\u00fd den a hodiny odb\u00edjely t\u00f8in\u00e1ctou.     <Oen.1.1.1.1>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.     <Ocs.1.1.1.2> Winston Smith, s bradou p\u00f8itisknutou k hrudi, aby unikl protivn\u00e9mu v\u00ectru, rychle proklouzl sklen\u00ecn\u00fdmi dve\u00f8mi v\u00ec\u00be\u00e1ku na S\u00eddli\u00b9ti v\u00edt\u00eczstv\u00ed, ne v\u00b9ak dost rychle, aby zabr\u00e1nil zv\u00ed\u00f8en\u00e9mu p\u00edsku a prachu vniknout dovnit\u00f8.     <Oen.1.1.1.2> Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.     <Oen.1.1.2.1>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats.     <Ocs.1.1.2.2>Na st\u00ecn\u00ec na jednom konci \u00fazk\u00e9ho prostoru byl p\u00f8ip\u00edchnut barevn\u00fd plak\u00e1t, kter\u00fd se svou velikost\u00ed dovnit\u00f8 nehodil.     <Oen.1.1.2.2>At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.     <Ocs.1.1.2.3>Byla na n\u00ecm jen obrovsk\u00e1 tv\u00e1\u00f8 mu\u00bee asi p\u00ecta\u00e8ty\u00f8icetilet\u00e9ho, s hust\u00fdm \u00e8ern\u00fdm kn\u00edrem, drsn\u00fdch, ale hezk\u00fdch rys\u00f9.     <Oen.1.1.2.3>It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.     <Ocs.1.1.2.4> Winston zam\u00ed\u00f8il ke schod\u00f9m.     <Oen.1.1.2.4> Winston made for the stairs.     <Ocs.1.1.2.5>Nem\u00eclo smysl zkou\u00b9et v\u00fdtah.     <Oen.1.1.2.5>It was no use trying the lift.     <Ocs.1.1.2.6>I v lep\u00b9\u00edch \u00e8asech z\u00f8\u00eddka fungoval a te\u00ef se elektrick\u00fd proud p\u00f8es den vyp\u00ednal v r\u00e1mci \u00fasporn\u00fdch opat\u00f8en\u00ed v

<Ocs.1.1.2.7>Byt byl v sedm\u00e9m pat\u00f8e.     <Oen.1.1.2.7>It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.     <Ocs.1.1.2.8> Winston, kter\u00e9mu bylo dev\u00ectat\u00f8icet a m\u00ecl b\u00e9rcov\u00fd v\u00f8ed nad prav\u00fdm kotn\u00edkem, kr\u00e1\u00e8el pomalu a n\u00eckolikr\u00e1t si cestou odpo\u00e8inul.     <Oen.1.1.2.8>The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way.     <Ocs.1.1.2.9>Na ka\u00bed\u00e9m poschod\u00ed naproti v\u00fdtahov\u00fdm dve\u00f8\u00edm na n\u00echo se zdi z\u00edrala obrovsk\u00e1 tv\u00e1\u00f8 z plak\u00e1t\u00f9.     <Oen.1.1.2.9>On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall.     <Ocs.1.1.2.10>Byl to jeden z t\u00ecch obraz\u00f9, kter\u00e9 jsou ud\u00ecl\u00e1ny tak d\u00f9mysln\u00ec, \u00bee v\u00e1s o\u00e8i sleduj\u00ed, kam se

pod obrazem.     <Oen.1.1.2.11>\" Big Brother is watching you\", the caption beneath it ran.     <Oen.1.1.3.1>Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron.     <Ocs.1.1.3.2>Hlas vych\u00e1zel z obd\u00e9ln\u00edkov\u00e9 desky, jak\u00e9hosi matn\u00e9ho zrcadla, je\u00be bylo sou\u00e8\u00e1st\u00ed povrchu st\u00ecny po prav\u00e9 stran\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.3.2>The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall.     <Ocs.1.1.3.3> Winston oto\u00e8il knofl\u00edkem a hlas se trochu zti\u00b9il, ale slov\u00f9m bylo st\u00e1le je\u00b9t\u00ec rozum\u00ect.     <Oen.1.1.3.3> Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable.     <Ocs.1.1.3.4>P\u00f8\u00edstroj (ve skute\u00e8nosti televizn\u00ed obrazovka) se dal ztlumit, ale nebylo mo\u00ben\u00e9 ho \u00fapln\u00ec vypnout.     <Oen.1.1.3.4>The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.     <Oen.1.1.3.5>He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the Party.     <Ocs.1.1.3.6>Vlasy m\u00ecl velmi sv\u00ectl\u00e9, tv\u00e1\u00f8 p\u00f8irozen\u00ec rum\u00ecnou,

sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.     <Ocs.1.1.4.1>Sv\u00ect venku vypadal i p\u00f8es zav\u00f8en\u00e9 okno

<Oen.1.1.4.2>Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere.     <Ocs.1.1.4.3>Tv\u00e1\u00f8 s \u00e8ern\u00fdm kn\u00edrem shl\u00ed\u00beela ze v\u00b9ech n\u00e1ro\u00be\u00ed, kam oko dohl\u00e9dlo.     <Oen.1.1.4.3>The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner.     <Ocs.1.1.4.4>Jeden visel na pr\u00f9\u00e8el\u00ed domu hned naproti.     <Oen.1.1.4.4>There was one on the

<Oen.1.1.4.5>\" Big Brother is watching you,\" the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own.     <Ocs.1.1.4.6>Dole na ulici se ve v\u00ectru k\u00f8e\u00e8ovit\u00ec t\u00f8epotal dal\u00b9\u00ed plak\u00e1t, na jednom rohu roztr\u00been\u00fd, a st\u00f8\u00eddav\u00ec zakr\u00fdval a odkr\u00fdval jedin\u00e9 slovo \" Angsoc\".     <Oen.1.1.4.6>Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word \" Ingsoc\".     <Ocs.1.1.4.7>Daleko odtud se snesl mezi st\u00f8echy vrtuln\u00edk, chvilku se vzn\u00e1\u00b9el jako moucha masa\u00f8ka a obloukem zase odlet\u00ecl.     <Oen.1.1.4.7>In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight.     <Ocs.1.1.4.8>Byla to policejn\u00ed hl\u00eddka, co strk\u00e1 lidem nos do oken.     <Oen.1.1.4.8>It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows.     <Ocs.1.1.4.9>Ale hl\u00eddky nebyly d\u00f9le\u00beit\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.4.9>The patrols did not matter, however.     <Ocs.1.1.4.10>D\u00f9le\u00beit\u00e1 byla jedin\u00ec Ideopolicie.     <Oen.1.1.4.10>Only the Thought Police mattered.     <Ocs.1.1.5.1>Za Winstonov\u00fdmi z\u00e1dy st\u00e1le je\u00b9t\u00ec n\u00eckdo \u00bevanil z obrazovky o

pig-iron and the overfulfillment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan.     <Ocs.1.1.5.2>Obrazovka sou\u00e8asn\u00ec p\u00f8ij\u00edmala a vys\u00edlala.     <Oen.1.1.5.2>The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.     <Ocs.1.1.5.3>Ka\u00bed\u00fd zvuk, kter\u00fd Winston vydal a jen\u00be byl hlasit\u00ecj\u00b9\u00ed ne\u00be velmi tich\u00e9 \u00b9ept\u00e1n\u00ed, obrazovka zachycovala; a co v\u00edc, pokud z\u00f9st\u00e1val v zorn\u00e9m poli kovov\u00e9 desky, bylo ho vid\u00ect a sly\u00b9et.     <Oen.1.1.5.3>Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard.     <Ocs.1.1.5.4>Samoz\u00f8ejm\u00ec, \u00e8lov\u00eck si nikdy nebyl jist, zda ho v dan\u00e9m okam\u00beiku sleduj\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.5.4>There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment.     <Ocs.1.1.5.5>Jak \u00e8asto a podle jak\u00e9ho syst\u00e9mu Ideopolicie zap\u00ednala jednotliv\u00e1 za\u00f8\u00edzen\u00ed, bylo h\u00e1dankou.     <Oen.1.1.5.5>How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork.     <Oen.1.1.5.6>It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time.     <Ocs.1.1.5.7>A rozhodn\u00ec mohli zapnout va\u00b9e za\u00f8\u00edzen\u00ed, kdy se jim cht\u00eclo.     <Oen.1.1.5.7>But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to.     <Ocs.1.1.5.8>\u00c8lov\u00eck musel \u00be\u00edt -- a \u00beil, ze zvyku, kter\u00fd se stal pudov\u00fdm, -- v p\u00f8edpokladu, \u00bee ka\u00bed\u00fd zvuk, kter\u00fd vyd\u00e1, je zaslechnut, a ka\u00bed\u00fd pohyb, pokud nen\u00ed tma, zaznamen\u00e1n.     <Oen.1.1.5.8>You had to live -- did live, from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.     <Oen.1.1.6.1> Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen.     <Ocs.1.1.6.2>To bylo bezpe\u00e8n\u00ecj\u00b9\u00ed; a\u00e8koli, jak dob\u00f8e v\u00ecd\u00ecl, i z\u00e1da mohou ledacos prozradit.     <Oen.1.1.6.2>It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing.     <Ocs.1.1.6.3>Kilometr odtud se ty\u00e8ila nad \u00b9pinavou krajinou vysok\u00e1 b\u00edl\u00e1 budova Ministerstva pravdy, jeho pracovi\u00b9t\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.6.3>A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.     <Ocs.1.1.6.4>Toto je Lond\u00fdn, pomyslel si s jistou nechut\u00ed, hlavn\u00ed m\u00ecsto \u00dazemn\u00ed oblasti jedna, t\u00f8et\u00ed nejlidnat\u00ecj\u00b9\u00ed provincie Oce\u00e1nie.     <Oen.1.1.6.4>This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste -- this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania.     <Ocs.1.1.6.5>Sna\u00beil se vydolovat n\u00ecjakou vzpom\u00ednku z d\u00ectstv\u00ed, kter\u00e1 by mu \u00f8ekla, zda Lond\u00fdn b\u00fdval v\u00bedycky takov\u00fd.     <Oen.1.1.6.5>He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this.     <Ocs.1.1.6.6>Byla tu odjak\u00beiva tahle vyhl\u00eddka na

houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions?     <Ocs.1.1.6.7>Byly tu odjak\u00beiva trosky po bombardov\u00e1n\u00ed, nad nimi\u00be ve vzduchu v\u00ed\u00f8\u00ed prach z om\u00edtky, i vrby skl\u00e1n\u00ecj\u00edc\u00ed se nad hromadami

kurn\u00edk\u00f9m?     <Oen.1.1.6.7>And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses?     <Ocs.1.1.6.9>Ale nem\u00eclo to smysl, nemohl si vzpomenout: z d\u00ectstv\u00ed mu v pam\u00ecti nez\u00f9stalo nic ne\u00be p\u00e1r jasn\u00ec osv\u00ectlen\u00fdch obr\u00e1zk\u00f9, kter\u00e9 nem\u00ecly \u00be\u00e1dn\u00e9 pozad\u00ed a byly v\u00ect\u00b9inou nesrozumiteln\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.6.8>But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.     <Ocs.1.1.7.1> Ministerstvo pravdy, v newspeaku* Pramini se d\u00ecsiv\u00ec li\u00b9ilo od v\u00b9ech ostatn\u00edch objekt\u00f9 v dohledu.     <Oen.1.1.7.1> Ministry of Truth, -- Minitrue, in

terasovit\u00ec vyp\u00ednala do v\u00fd\u00b9ky 300 metr\u00f9.     <Oen.1.1.7.2>It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres

<Ocs.1.1.10.4>Bylo to m\u00edsto, kam se nedalo vstoupit jinak ne\u00be v ofici\u00e1ln\u00ed z\u00e1le\u00beitosti, a to pouze tak, \u00bee \u00e8lov\u00eck musel proniknout z\u00e1tarasy z

<Oen.1.1.10.5>Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.     <Ocs.1.1.11.1> Winston se r\u00e1zn\u00ec oto\u00e8il.     <Oen.1.1.11.1> Winston turned round abruptly.     <Ocs.1.1.11.2>Vyladil rysy v obli\u00e8eji do v\u00fdrazu pokojn\u00e9ho optimismu, kter\u00fd bylo radno nasadit, kdy\u00be byl

and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast.     <Ocs.1.1.11.6>Vzal z poli\u00e8ky l\u00e1hev bezbarv\u00e9 tekutiny s jednoduchou b\u00edlou vin\u00ectou, na kter\u00e9 st\u00e1lo Gin v\u00edt\u00eczstv\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.11.5>He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a

<Oen.1.1.11.6>It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice spirit.     <Ocs.1.1.11.8> Winston si nalil t\u00e9m\u00ec\u00f8 pln\u00fd \u00b9\u00e1lek, dodal si odvahy a obr\u00e1til to do sebe nar\u00e1z jako medic\u00ednu.     <Oen.1.1.11.7> Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.     <Ocs.1.1.12.1>Tv\u00e1\u00f8 mu okam\u00beit\u00ec zrudla a z o\u00e8\u00ed mu vytryskly slzy.     <Oen.1.1.12.1>Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes.     <Ocs.1.1.12.2>To svinstvo

<Oen.1.1.12.2>The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club.     <Ocs.1.1.12.3>V

his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful.     <Ocs.1.1.12.4>Vzal si cigaretu ze zma\u00e8kan\u00e9ho bal\u00ed\u00e8ku s n\u00e1pisem \" Cigarety v\u00edt\u00eczstv\u00ed\", ale

upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor.     <Ocs.1.1.12.5>S dal\u00b9\u00ed cigaretou u\u00be pochodil l\u00e9pe.     <Oen.1.1.12.5>With the next he was more successful.     <Ocs.1.1.12.6>Vr\u00e1til se do ob\u00fdvac\u00edho pokoje a sedl si ke stolu, kter\u00fd st\u00e1l vlevo od obrazovky.     <Oen.1.1.12.6>He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen.     <Oen.1.1.12.7>From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover.     <Ocs.1.1.13.1>Z nezn\u00e1m\u00e9ho d\u00f9vodu byla obrazovka v ob\u00fdvac\u00edm pokoji um\u00edst\u00ecna neobvykle.     <Oen.1.1.13.1>For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position.     <Ocs.1.1.13.2>M\u00edsto aby byla jako norm\u00e1ln\u00ec na \u00e8eln\u00ed st\u00ecn\u00ec, odkud by mohla ovl\u00e1dat celou m\u00edstnost, um\u00edstili ji na del\u00b9\u00ed zdi naproti oknu.     <Oen.1.1.13.2>Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window.     <Ocs.1.1.13.3> Winston nyn\u00ed sed\u00ecl v m\u00eclk\u00e9m v\u00fdklenku t\u00e9to st\u00ecny, kde asi p\u00f9vodn\u00ec m\u00ecly b\u00fdt vestav\u00ecny police na knihy.     <Oen.1.1.13.3>To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves.     <Ocs.1.1.13.4>Kdy\u00be Winston sed\u00ecl v koutku a dr\u00beel se hodn\u00ec vzadu, byl mimo zorn\u00e9 pole obrazovky.     <Oen.1.1.13.4>By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went.     <Ocs.1.1.13.5>Mohlo ho samoz\u00f8ejm\u00ec b\u00fdt sly\u00b9et, ale pokud z\u00f9st\u00e1val ve sv\u00e9 nyn\u00ecj\u00b9\u00ed pozici, nemohlo ho b\u00fdt vid\u00ect.     <Oen.1.1.13.5>He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen.     <Ocs.1.1.13.6>Neobvykl\u00e9 rozvr\u00been\u00ed pokoje mu z\u00e8\u00e1sti vnuklo n\u00e1pad d\u00eclat to, k \u00e8emu se pr\u00e1v\u00ec chystal.     <Oen.1.1.13.6>It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.     <Ocs.1.1.14.1>Ale z\u00e8\u00e1sti ho k tomu p\u00f8ivedl i se\u00b9it, kter\u00fd pr\u00e1v\u00ec vylovil ze z\u00e1suvky.     <Oen.1.1.14.1>But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer.     <Ocs.1.1.14.2>Byl to neoby\u00e8ejn\u00ec kr\u00e1sn\u00fd se\u00b9it.     <Oen.1.1.14.2>It was a peculiarly beautiful book.     <Ocs.1.1.14.3>Pap\u00edr byl smetanov\u00ec hladk\u00fd, v\u00eckem u\u00be trochu za\u00beloutl\u00fd, jak\u00fd se u\u00be aspo\u00f2 \u00e8ty\u00f8icet let nevyr\u00e1b\u00ecl.     <Oen.1.1.14.3>Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past.     <Ocs.1.1.14.4>Odhadoval v\u00b9ak, \u00bee se\u00b9it byl je\u00b9t\u00ec mnohem star\u00b9\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.14.4>He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that.     <Ocs.1.1.14.5> Winston ho zahl\u00e9dl ve v\u00fdkladu zatuchl\u00e9ho kr\u00e1mku se staro\u00beitnostmi na perif\u00e9rii (ale kter\u00e1 \u00e8tvr\u00bb to byla, si nepamatoval) a hned se ho zmocnila nep\u00f8ekonateln\u00e1 touha vlastnit ho.     <Oen.1.1.14.5>He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it.     <Ocs.1.1.14.6>\u00c8lenov\u00e9 Strany m\u00ecli na\u00f8\u00edzeno nenakupovat v oby\u00e8ejn\u00fdch obchodech ( \"pod\u00edlet se na voln\u00e9m trhu\" se tomu \u00f8\u00edkalo), ale toto pravidlo se tak p\u00f8\u00edsn\u00ec nedodr\u00beovalo, proto\u00bee r\u00f9zn\u00e9 v\u00ecci, jako nap\u00f8\u00edklad tkani\u00e8ky do bot nebo \u00beiletky, nebyly jinak v\u00f9bec k dost\u00e1n\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.14.6>Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops (\"dealing on the free market\", it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way.     <Ocs.1.1.14.7>Rychle se rozhl\u00e9dl ulic\u00ed, vklouzl dovnit\u00f8 a za dva dolary pades\u00e1t si se\u00b9it koupil.     <Oen.1.1.14.7>He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty.     <Ocs.1.1.14.8>V t\u00e9 chv\u00edli ho nenapadlo, k jak\u00e9mu konkr\u00e9tn\u00edmu \u00fa\u00e8elu by mohl se\u00b9it upot\u00f8ebit.     <Oen.1.1.14.8>At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose.     <Ocs.1.1.14.9>S provinil\u00fdm pocitem si ho v aktovce p\u00f8inesl dom\u00f9.     <Oen.1.1.14.9>He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase.     <Ocs.1.1.14.10>Vlastnit takov\u00fd se\u00b9it bylo samo o sob\u00ec kompromituj\u00edc\u00ed, i kdyby v n\u00ecm nebylo naps\u00e1no nic.     <Oen.1.1.14.10>Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession.     <Ocs.1.1.15.1>Chystal se ps\u00e1t den\u00edk.     <Oen.1.1.15.1>The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary.     <Ocs.1.1.15.2>To nebylo protiz\u00e1konn\u00e9 (nic nebylo nez\u00e1konn\u00e9, proto\u00bee \u00be\u00e1dn\u00e9 z\u00e1kony u\u00be d\u00e1vno neplatily), ale kdyby se na to p\u00f8i\u00b9lo, bylo celkem jist\u00e9, \u00bee by za to dostal trest

was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced labour camp.     <Ocs.1.1.15.3> Winston nasadil pero do n\u00e1sadky a ol\u00edzl \u00b9pi\u00e8ku, aby ji zbavil mastnoty.     <Oen.1.1.15.3> Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off.     <Ocs.1.1.15.4>Pero bylo zastaral\u00fd n\u00e1stroj, dokonce i k podpis\u00f9m se ho pou\u00be\u00edvalo jen z\u00f8\u00eddka, a Winston si jedno obstaral, tajn\u00ec a dost obt\u00ed\u00ben\u00ec, prost\u00ec proto, \u00bee m\u00ecl pocit, \u00bee ten kr\u00e1sn\u00fd smetanov\u00fd pap\u00edr si zaslou\u00be\u00ed, aby se na n\u00ecj psalo skute\u00e8n\u00fdm perem a nikoli \u00b9kr\u00e1balo propisova\u00e8kou.     <Oen.1.1.15.4>The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil.     <Ocs.1.1.15.5>Vlastn\u00ec ani nebyl zvykl\u00fd ps\u00e1t rukou.     <Oen.1.1.15.5>Actually he was not used to writing by hand.     <Ocs.1.1.15.6>Krom\u00ec velmi stru\u00e8n\u00fdch pozn\u00e1mek bylo obvykl\u00e9 diktovat v\u00b9echno do *speakwritu* ( *speak* -- mluvit, *write* -- ps\u00e1t), co\u00be ov\u00b9em pro jeho moment\u00e1ln\u00ed z\u00e1m\u00ecr bylo vylou\u00e8en\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.15.6>Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was of course impossible for his present purpose.     <Ocs.1.1.15.7>Namo\u00e8il pero do inkoustu a na okam\u00beik zav\u00e1hal.     <Oen.1.1.15.7>He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second.     <Ocs.1.1.15.8>V \u00fatrob\u00e1ch ho zamrazilo.     <Oen.1.1.15.8>A tremor had gone through his bowels.     <Ocs.1.1.15.9>A\u00be se dotkne pap\u00edru, bude to m\u00edt v\u00fdznam rozhodn\u00e9ho \u00e8inu.     <Oen.1.1.15.9>To mark the paper was the decisive act.     <Oen.1.1.17.2>A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him.     <Ocs.1.1.17.3>P\u00f8edev\u00b9\u00edm nev\u00ecd\u00ecl s jistotou, jestli je rok 1984.     <Oen.1.1.17.3>To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984.     <Ocs.1.1.17.4>Datum by m\u00eclo p\u00f8ibli\u00ben\u00ec

his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.     <Ocs.1.1.18.1>Pro koho vlastn\u00ec ten den\u00edk p\u00ed\u00b9e, napadlo ho n\u00e1hle.     <Oen.1.1.18.1>For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?     <Ocs.1.1.18.2>Pro budoucnost, pro ty, kte\u00f8\u00ed se je\u00b9t\u00ec nenarodili?     <Oen.1.1.18.2>For the future, for the unborn.     <Ocs.1.1.18.3>Jeho my\u00b9lenky chvilku bloudily kolem pochybn\u00e9ho letopo\u00e8tu na str\u00e1nce a potom narazily na newspeakov\u00e9 slovo \"doublethink\" ( *double* -- dvoj\u00ed, *think* -- myslet).     <Oen.1.1.18.3>His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the

<Oen.1.1.18.4>For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him.     <Oen.1.1.18.5>How could you communicate with the future?     <Ocs.1.1.18.6>To je samo o sob\u00ec

dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate.     <Ocs.1.1.24.2> Winston si u\u00be u\u00be

<Ocs.1.1.24.4>Neznal ji jm\u00e9nem, ale v\u00ecd\u00ecl, \u00bee pracuje v Odd\u00eclen\u00ed literatury.     <Oen.1.1.24.4>He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction

mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines.     <Ocs.1.1.24.6>Z d\u00edvky vyza\u00f8ovalo sebev\u00ecdom\u00ed, mohlo j\u00ed b\u00fdt tak sedmadvacet, m\u00ecla hust\u00e9 tmav\u00e9 vlasy,

movements.     <Oen.1.1.24.7>A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips.     <Ocs.1.1.24.8> Winstonovi se od prvn\u00edho okam\u00beiku nel\u00edbila.     <Oen.1.1.24.8> Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her.     <Ocs.1.1.24.9>V\u00ecd\u00ecl pro\u00e8.     <Oen.1.1.24.9>He knew the reason.     <Ocs.1.1.24.10>Proto\u00bee kolem sebe vytv\u00e1\u00f8ela atmosf\u00e9ru hokejov\u00e9ho h\u00f8i\u00b9t\u00ec,

and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her.     <Ocs.1.1.24.11>Pohl\u00ed\u00beel na \u00beeny s nechut\u00ed, zvl\u00e1\u00b9\u00bb na mlad\u00e9 a hezk\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.24.11>He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones.     <Oen.1.1.24.12>It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy.     <Ocs.1.1.24.13>Ale toto d\u00ecv\u00e8e v n\u00ecm vzbuzovalo dojem, \u00bee je

<Ocs.1.1.24.14>Jednou, kdy\u00be kolem sebe proch\u00e1zeli na chodb\u00ec, vrhla na n\u00echo \u00fakosem ostr\u00fd pohled, kter\u00fd ho na okam\u00beik naplnil temnou hr\u00f9zou.     <Oen.1.1.24.14>Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror.     <Oen.1.1.24.15>The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police.     <Ocs.1.1.24.16>To v\u00b9ak po pravd\u00ec \u00f8e\u00e8eno bylo velmi nepravd\u00ecpodobn\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.24.16>That, it was true, was very unlikely.     <Ocs.1.1.24.17>Ale i tak poci\u00bboval zvl\u00e1\u00b9tn\u00ed neklid, s n\u00edm\u00be se m\u00edsil i strach

anywhere near him.     <Ocs.1.1.25.1>Druhou osobou byl mu\u00be jm\u00e9nem O'Brien, \u00e8len Vnit\u00f8n\u00ed strany, kter\u00fd m\u00ecl postaven\u00ed tak v\u00fdznamn\u00e9 a vzd\u00e1len\u00e9, \u00bee si o n\u00ecm Winston nedok\u00e1zal vytvo\u00f8it sebemen\u00b9\u00ed p\u00f8edstavu.     <Oen.1.1.25.1>The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature.     <Oen.1.1.25.2>A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching.     <Ocs.1.1.25.3> O'Brien byl rozlo\u00beit\u00fd, siln\u00fd mu\u00be s pevnou \u00b9\u00edj\u00ed a drsnou, v\u00fdraznou, krutou tv\u00e1\u00f8\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.25.3> O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face.     <Oen.1.1.25.4>In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner.     <Ocs.1.1.25.5>Zvl\u00e1\u00b9tn\u00edm zp\u00f9sobem si rovnal br\u00fdle na nose, co\u00be bylo neoby\u00e8ejn\u00ec odzbrojuj\u00edc\u00ed gesto a v nedefinovateln\u00e9m smyslu u\u00b9lechtil\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.25.5>He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming -- in some indefinable way, curiously civilized.     <Ocs.1.1.25.6>Bylo to gesto, kter\u00e9 by mohlo vyvolat p\u00f8edstavu \u00b9lechtice z osmn\u00e1ct\u00e9ho stolet\u00ed nab\u00edzej\u00edc\u00edho tabat\u00ecrku se \u00b9\u00f2upav\u00fdm tab\u00e1kem, kdyby

eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox.     <Ocs.1.1.25.7> Winston O'Briena vid\u00ecl za posledn\u00edch deset let snad desetkr\u00e1t.     <Oen.1.1.25.7> Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years.     <Ocs.1.1.25.8>Cosi ho k n\u00ecmu siln\u00ec p\u00f8itahovalo, a nebyl to jen kontrast mezi O'Brienov\u00fdm uhlazen\u00fdm chov\u00e1n\u00edm a fyzick\u00fdm vzez\u00f8en\u00edm z\u00e1pasn\u00edka.     <Oen.1.1.25.8>He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's physique.     <Ocs.1.1.25.9>Mnohem v\u00edc tu p\u00f9sobila tajn\u00e1 v\u00edra -- anebo snad ne v\u00edra, ale sp\u00ed\u00b9 nad\u00ecje, \u00bee O'Brienova politick\u00e1 pravov\u00ecrnost nen\u00ed bez kazu.     <Oen.1.1.25.9>Much more it was because of a secretly held belief -- or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope -- that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect.     <Ocs.1.1.25.10>Cosi v jeho tv\u00e1\u00f8i to nepopirateln\u00ec nazna\u00e8ovalo.     <Oen.1.1.25.10>Something in his face suggested it irresistibly.     <Ocs.1.1.25.11>Mo\u00ben\u00e1

simply intelligence.     <Ocs.1.1.25.12>V ka\u00bed\u00e9m p\u00f8\u00edpad\u00ec vypadal jako n\u00eckdo, s k\u00fdm by se dalo hovo\u00f8it, kdyby s n\u00edm \u00e8lov\u00eck mohl z\u00f9stat o samot\u00ec p\u00f8i vypnut\u00e9 obrazovce.     <Oen.1.1.25.12>But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone.     <Ocs.1.1.25.13> Winston v\u00b9ak nikdy nevyvinul nejmen\u00b9\u00ed \u00fasil\u00ed, aby si svou domn\u00ecnku ov\u00ec\u00f8il: vlastn\u00ec to ani ne\u00b9lo.     <Oen.1.1.25.13> Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so.     <Ocs.1.1.25.14>V tu chv\u00edli pohl\u00e9dl O'Brien na svoje n\u00e1ramkov\u00e9 hodinky; zjistil,

was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over.     <Ocs.1.1.25.15>Usedl na \u00beidli v t\u00e9\u00bee \u00f8ad\u00ec jako

<Ocs.1.1.25.17>D\u00edvka s tmav\u00fdmi vlasy sed\u00ecla hned za nimi.     <Oen.1.1.25.17>The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.     <Ocs.1.1.26.1>V p\u00f8\u00ed\u00b9t\u00edm

p\u00f8i nich\u00be \u00e8lov\u00ecku cvakaly zuby a je\u00beily se vlasy na hlav\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.26.2>It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one's neck.     <Ocs.1.1.26.3>Za\u00e8ala Nen\u00e1vist.     <Oen.1.1.26.3>The Hate had started.     <Ocs.1.1.27.1>Jako oby\u00e8ejn\u00ec se na obrazovce objevila tv\u00e1\u00f8 Emanuela Goldsteina, Nep\u00f8\u00edtele lidu.     <Oen.1.1.27.1>As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen.     <Ocs.1.1.27.2>Tu a tam se mezi poslucha\u00e8i ozval sykot.     <Oen.1.1.27.2>There were hisses here and there among the audience.     <Ocs.1.1.27.3>Drobn\u00e1 \u00beena s p\u00edskov\u00fdmi vlasy ze sebe vydala sk\u00f8ek, v n\u00ecm\u00be se m\u00edsil strach a odpor.     <Oen.1.1.27.3>The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust.     <Ocs.1.1.27.4> Goldstein byl reneg\u00e1t a odpadl\u00edk, kter\u00fd kdysi d\u00e1vno (jak d\u00e1vno, si nikdo nepamatoval) byl jednou z vedouc\u00edch osobnost\u00ed Strany, t\u00e9m\u00ec\u00f8 na \u00farovni samotn\u00e9ho Velk\u00e9ho bratra, potom se zapletl do kontrarevolu\u00e8n\u00ed \u00e8innosti, byl odsouzen k smrti, ale tajupln\u00ec unikl a zmizel.     <Oen.1.1.27.4> Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared.     <Ocs.1.1.27.5>Programy Dvou minut nen\u00e1visti se den ode dne m\u00ecnily, ale nebylo jednoho, v n\u00ecm\u00be by Goldstein nefiguroval na \u00e8eln\u00e9m m\u00edst\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.27.5>The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure.     <Oen.1.1.27.6>He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party's purity.     <Ocs.1.1.27.7>V\u00b9echny dal\u00b9\u00ed zlo\u00e8iny proti Stran\u00ec, v\u00b9echny zrady,

sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching.     <Ocs.1.1.27.8>Kdesi je\u00b9t\u00ec st\u00e1le \u00beil a kul svoje pikle; mo\u00ben\u00e1 za mo\u00f8em, pod ochranou

<Oen.1.1.27.8>Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even -- so it was occasionally rumoured -- in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.     <Ocs.1.1.28.2>P\u00f8i pohledu na Goldsteinovu tv\u00e1\u00f8 zakou\u00b9el v\u00bedy bolestnou sm\u00ecsici pocit\u00f9.     <Oen.1.1.28.2>He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions.     <Ocs.1.1.28.3>Byla to huben\u00e1 \u00beidovsk\u00e1 tv\u00e1\u00f8 s velkou aureolou ku\u00e8erav\u00fdch b\u00edl\u00fdch vlas\u00f9 a s malou koz\u00ed bradkou -- tv\u00e1\u00f8 chytr\u00e1, a p\u00f8ece jako by si zaslou\u00beila opovr\u00been\u00ed, s v\u00fdrazem seniln\u00ed

aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard -- a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched.     <Ocs.1.1.28.4>Trochu sv\u00fdm vzez\u00f8en\u00edm p\u00f8ipom\u00ednal ovci, i hlas m\u00ecl me\u00e8iv\u00fd.     <Oen.1.1.28.4>It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality.     <Ocs.1.1.28.5> Goldstein vedl sv\u00f9j obvykl\u00fd jedovat\u00fd \u00fatok na u\u00e8en\u00ed Strany -- \u00fatok tak p\u00f8ehnan\u00fd a

n\u00eckte\u00f8\u00ed m\u00e9n\u00ec rozumn\u00ed lid\u00e9 mohli uv\u00ec\u00f8it.     <Oen.1.1.28.5> Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party -- an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it.     <Ocs.1.1.28.6>Ostouzel Velk\u00e9ho bratra, odsuzoval diktaturu Strany, po\u00beadoval okam\u00beit\u00e9 uzav\u00f8en\u00ed m\u00edru s Eurasi\u00ed, obhajoval svobodu projevu, svobodu tisku, svobodu shroma\u00be\u00efov\u00e1n\u00ed, svobodu my\u00b9len\u00ed, hystericky k\u00f8i\u00e8el, \u00bee revoluce byla zrazena -- a to v\u00b9echno v rychl\u00e9m sledu mnohoslabi\u00e8n\u00fdch slov, kter\u00fd byl parodi\u00ed na obvykl\u00fd styl \u00f8e\u00e8n\u00edk\u00f9 Strany a obsahoval dokonce slova newspeaku; fakticky bylo v jeho \u00f8e\u00e8i v\u00edce slov newspeaku, ne\u00be by \u00e8len Strany norm\u00e1ln\u00ec pou\u00beil ve skute\u00e8n\u00e9m \u00beivot\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.28.6>He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed -- and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally use in real life.     <Ocs.1.1.28.7>A po celou tu dobu, aby nikdo nepochyboval o tom, co Goldstein s takovou ok\u00e1zalou teatr\u00e1lnost\u00ed l\u00ed\u00e8il, pochodovaly za jeho hlavou na obrazovce nekone\u00e8n\u00e9 z\u00e1stupy eurasijsk\u00e9 arm\u00e1dy, sev\u00f8en\u00e9 \u00f8ady mu\u00be\u00f9

<Oen.1.1.28.7>And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army -- row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar.     <Oen.1.1.28.8>The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.     <Ocs.1.1.29.1> Nen\u00e1vist trvala sotva t\u00f8icet vte\u00f8in a polovina lid\u00ed v m\u00edstnosti za\u00e8ala neovladateln\u00ec, zb\u00ecsile pok\u00f8ikovat.     <Oen.1.1.29.1>Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.     <Ocs.1.1.29.2>Samolib\u00e1 ov\u00e8\u00ed tv\u00e1\u00f8 na obrazovce a hroziv\u00e1 s\u00edla eurasijsk\u00e9 arm\u00e1dy na n\u00ed -- to bylo v\u00edc, ne\u00be se dalo sn\u00e9st: krom\u00ec toho pohled nebo dokonce jen pomy\u00b9len\u00ed na Goldsteina automaticky vyvol\u00e1valy strach a hn\u00ecv.     <Oen.1.1.29.2>The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically.     <Ocs.1.1.29.3>Byl p\u00f8edm\u00ectem trvalej\u00b9\u00ed nen\u00e1visti ne\u00be Eurasie nebo Eastasie, proto\u00bee kdy\u00be Oce\u00e1nie vedla v\u00e1lku s jednou z t\u00ecchto velmoc\u00ed, \u00beila zpravidla v m\u00edru s druhou.     <Oen.1.1.29.3>He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other.     <Ocs.1.1.29.4>To bylo p\u00f8inejmen\u00b9\u00edm podivn\u00e9.<Ocs.1.1.29.5> Goldsteina sice ka\u00bed\u00fd nen\u00e1vid\u00ecl a pohrdal

Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less.     <Ocs.1.1.29.6>Po ka\u00bed\u00e9 se znovu na\u00b9li bl\u00e1zni, kte\u00f8\u00ed se dali sv\u00e9st.     <Oen.1.1.29.5>Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him.     <Ocs.1.1.29.7>Neminul den, aby Ideopolicie neodhalila \u00b9pi\u00f3ny a

<Ocs.1.1.29.8>Byl velitelem obrovsk\u00e9 st\u00ednov\u00e9 arm\u00e1dy, podzemn\u00ed s\u00edt\u00ec spiklenc\u00f9, kte\u00f8\u00ed usilovali o svr\u00been\u00ed St\u00e1tu.     <Oen.1.1.29.7>He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State.     <Ocs.1.1.29.9>Tito lid\u00e9 si \u00fadajn\u00ec \u00f8\u00edkali Bratrstvo.     <Oen.1.1.29.8>The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be.     <Oen.1.1.29.9>There were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there.     <Ocs.1.1.29.11>Byla to kniha bez n\u00e1zvu.     <Oen.1.1.29.10>It was a book without a title.     <Ocs.1.1.29.12>Lid\u00e9 o n\u00ed

<Ocs.1.1.29.14>\u00d8\u00e1dn\u00fd \u00e8len Strany se o Bratrstvu \u00e8i o \"knize\" nezm\u00ednil, pokud se tomu mohl vyhnout.     <Oen.1.1.29.13>Neither the Brotherhood nor \"the book\" was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it.     <Ocs.1.1.30.1>Ve druh\u00e9 minut\u00ec p\u00f8e\u00b9la nen\u00e1vist v z\u00e1chvat zu\u00f8ivosti.     <Oen.1.1.30.1>In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy.     <Ocs.1.1.30.2>Lid\u00e9 vyskakovali z m\u00edst, k\u00f8i\u00e8eli z pln\u00fdch plic a sna\u00beili se uml\u00e8et

<Oen.1.1.30.5>He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave.     <Ocs.1.1.30.6>Tmavovlas\u00e1 d\u00edvka

girl behind Winston had begun crying out \"Swine! Swine! Swine!\" and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen.     <Oen.1.1.30.7>It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably.     <Ocs.1.1.30.8> Winston v jasn\u00e9m okam\u00beiku zjistil, \u00bee \u00f8ve s ostatn\u00edmi a zu\u00f8iv\u00ec kope patou do trno\u00bee.     <Oen.1.1.30.8>In a lucid moment Winston found that he

but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in.     <Ocs.1.1.30.10>Po t\u00f8iceti vte\u00f8in\u00e1ch se u\u00be nikdo nemusel p\u00f8etva\u00f8ovat.     <Oen.1.1.30.10>Within

<Oen.1.1.30.11>A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric

switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.     <Ocs.1.1.30.13>Winstonova nen\u00e1vist nebyla tak v jednu chv\u00edli v\u00f9bec nam\u00ed\u00f8ena proti Goldsteinovi, ale

Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies.     <Ocs.1.1.30.15>A p\u00f8ece hned vz\u00e1p\u00ect\u00ed byl zase zajedno s ostatn\u00edmi a v\u00b9e, co se o

him to be true.     <Ocs.1.1.30.16>V takov\u00fdch chv\u00edl\u00edch se tajn\u00e9 prokl\u00edn\u00e1n\u00ed Velk\u00e9ho bratra m\u00ecnilo na uct\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed, zd\u00e1lo se mu, \u00bee se

zni\u00e8it stavbu civilizace.     <Oen.1.1.30.15>At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization.     <Ocs.1.1.31.1>A tak bylo ob\u00e8as mo\u00ben\u00e9 p\u00f8ep\u00ednat libovoln\u00ec svou nen\u00e1vist t\u00edm

zl\u00e9m snu prudk\u00fdm pohybem odtrhne hlavu od pol\u00b9t\u00e1\u00f8e, poda\u00f8ilo se i Winstonovi p\u00f8en\u00e9st svou nen\u00e1vist z tv\u00e1\u00f8e na obrazovce na tmavovlasou d\u00edvku za n\u00edm.     <Oen.1.1.31.2>Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him.     <Ocs.1.1.31.3>Mysl\u00ed se mu m\u00edhaly kr\u00e1sn\u00e9, \u00beiv\u00e9 p\u00f8edstavy.     <Oen.1.1.31.3>Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.     <Ocs.1.1.31.4>Utlouk\u00e1 ji k smrti gumov\u00fdm obu\u00b9kem.     <Oen.1.1.31.4>He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon.     <Ocs.1.1.31.6>Zn\u00e1sil\u00f2uje ji a v okam\u00beiku vyvrcholen\u00ed j\u00ed pro\u00f8\u00edzne hrdlo.     <Oen.1.1.31.6>He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax.     <Ocs.1.1.31.7>L\u00e9pe ne\u00be kdy jindy si te\u00ef uv\u00ecdomoval, pro\u00e8 ji nen\u00e1vid\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.31.7>Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her.     <Ocs.1.1.31.8>Proto\u00bee je mlad\u00e1, hezk\u00e1 a bezpohlavn\u00ed, proto\u00bee by se s n\u00ed cht\u00ecl vyspat, co\u00be se nikdy nestane, proto\u00bee kolem rozko\u00b9n\u00e9ho,

<Oen.1.1.31.8>He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.     <Ocs.1.1.32.1> Nen\u00e1vist vrcholila.     <Oen.1.1.32.1>The Hate rose to its climax.     <Ocs.1.1.32.2>Z Goldsteinova hlasu se stalo skute\u00e8n\u00e9 ov\u00e8\u00ed be\u00e8en\u00ed a jeho tv\u00e1\u00f8 se na okam\u00beik zm\u00ecnila v ov\u00e8\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.32.2>The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.     <Ocs.1.1.32.3>Potom se ov\u00e8\u00ed \u00e8um\u00e1k prom\u00ecnil v postavu eurasijsk\u00e9ho voj\u00e1ka, kter\u00fd se p\u00f8ibli\u00beoval, obrovsk\u00fd, stra\u00b9liv\u00fd, s rachot\u00edc\u00edm samopalem, a\u00be se zd\u00e1lo, \u00bee vysko\u00e8\u00ed z obrazovky,

seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats.     <Ocs.1.1.32.4>Ale v tom okam\u00beiku si v\u00b9ichni s \u00falevou zhluboka oddechli, proto\u00bee nep\u00f8\u00e1telsk\u00e1 postava se prolnula do tv\u00e1\u00f8e Velk\u00e9ho

obrazovku.     <Oen.1.1.32.4>But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired, blackmoustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen.     <Ocs.1.1.32.5>Nikdo nesly\u00b9el, co Velk\u00fd bratr \u00f8\u00edk\u00e1.     <Oen.1.1.32.5>Nobody heard what Big

battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken.     <Ocs.1.1.32.7>Potom tv\u00e1\u00f8 Velk\u00e9ho bratra zase zmizela a m\u00edsto n\u00ed se objevila

and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals: \"War is peace\"\"Freedom is slavery\"\"Ignorance is strength.\"     <Ocs.1.1.33.1>Tv\u00e1\u00f8 Velk\u00e9ho bratra zd\u00e1nliv\u00ec je\u00b9t\u00ec n\u00eckolik vte\u00f8in na obrazovce setrv\u00e1vala, jako by jej\u00ed otisk na s\u00edtnic\u00edch v\u00b9ech p\u00f8\u00edtomn\u00fdch byl p\u00f8\u00edli\u00b9 \u00beiv\u00fd, ne\u00be aby okam\u00beit\u00ec zmizel.     <Oen.1.1.33.1>But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately.     <Ocs.1.1.33.2>Drobn\u00e1 \u00beena s p\u00edskov\u00fdmi vlasy se vrhla dop\u00f8edu na op\u00ecradlo \u00beidle.     <Oen.1.1.33.2>The little sandyhaired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her.     <Ocs.1.1.33.3>Hore\u00e8nat\u00ec \u00b9eptala cosi jako \"M\u00f9j spasiteli!\" a rozp\u00f8\u00e1hla ruce k obrazovce.     <Oen.1.1.33.3>With a tremulous murmur that sounded like \"My Saviour!\" she extended her arms towards the screen.     <Ocs.1.1.33.4>Potom si skryla tv\u00e1\u00f8 do dlan\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.33.4>Then she buried her face in her hands.     <Ocs.1.1.33.5>Bylo z\u00f8ejm\u00e9, \u00bee od\u00f8\u00edk\u00e1v\u00e1 modlitbu.     <Oen.1.1.33.5>It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.     <Ocs.1.1.34.1>V tu chv\u00edli za\u00e8ala cel\u00e1 skupina lid\u00ed ti\u00b9e a pomalu rytmicky skandovat: \" V-B! ...

B-B! ... B-B!\" -- over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first \"B\" and the second -- a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.     <Ocs.1.1.34.3>Vydr\u00beeli s t\u00edm asi t\u00f8icet vte\u00f8in.     <Oen.1.1.34.2>For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up.     <Ocs.1.1.34.4>Byl to refr\u00e9n, kter\u00fd se \u00e8asto oz\u00fdval ve chv\u00edl\u00edch vzru\u00b9en\u00fdch emoc\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.34.3>It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion.     <Ocs.1.1.34.5>\u00c8\u00e1ste\u00e8n\u00ec to byl zp\u00f9sob sebehypn\u00f3zy, \u00famysln\u00e9 potla\u00e8ov\u00e1n\u00ed v\u00ecdom\u00ed rytmick\u00fdm hlukem.     <Oen.1.1.34.4>Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.     <Oen.1.1.34.5> Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold.     <Ocs.1.1.34.7>Ve Dvou minut\u00e1ch nen\u00e1visti se nemohl ubr\u00e1nit dojmu, \u00bee sd\u00edl\u00ed v\u00b9eobecn\u00e9 delirium, ale to podlidsk\u00e9 skandov\u00e1n\u00ed \" V-B!\" ho v\u00bedy napl\u00f2ovalo hr\u00f9zou.     <Oen.1.1.34.6>In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of \" B-B! ... B-B!\" always filled him with horror.     <Ocs.1.1.34.8>Pravda, skandoval s ostatn\u00edmi, bylo nemo\u00ben\u00e9 chovat se jinak.     <Oen.1.1.34.7>Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise.     <Ocs.1.1.34.9>\u00c8lov\u00eck instinktivn\u00ec skr\u00fdval sv\u00e9 city, ovl\u00e1dal svou tv\u00e1\u00f8 a d\u00eclal tot\u00e9\u00be, co v\u00b9ichni ostatn\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.34.8>To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction.     <Ocs.1.1.34.10>Ale poka\u00bed\u00e9 se objevila

eyes might conceivably have betrayed him.     <Ocs.1.1.34.11>A pr\u00e1v\u00ec v tomto okam\u00beiku se stala ta v\u00fdznamn\u00e1 v\u00ecc -- pokud se v\u00f9bec stala.     <Oen.1.1.34.10>And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened -- if, indeed, it did happen.     <Oen.1.1.35.1>Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye.     <Ocs.1.1.35.2> O'Brien vstal.     <Oen.1.1.35.2> O'Brien had stood up.     <Ocs.1.1.35.3>P\u00f8edt\u00edm si sundal br\u00fdle a nyn\u00ed si je znovu nasazoval charakteristick\u00fdm pohybem.     <Oen.1.1.35.3>He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture.     <Ocs.1.1.35.4>Na zlomek vte\u00f8iny se jejich zraky setkaly, a v okam\u00beiku, kdy se to stalo, Winston v\u00ecd\u00ecl -- ano, v\u00ecd\u00ecl! -- \u00bee O'Brien si mysl\u00ed tot\u00e9\u00be, co on.     <Oen.1.1.35.4>But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew -- yes, he knew! -- that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself.     <Ocs.1.1.35.5>Prob\u00echlo mezi nimi neklamn\u00e9 sd\u00eclen\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.35.5>An

<Oen.1.1.35.6>It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes.     <Ocs.1.1.35.7>Zd\u00e1lo se mu, \u00bee O'Brien \u00f8\u00edk\u00e1: \"Jsem s tebou.\"     <Oen.1.1.35.7>\"I am with you,\" O'Brien seemed to be saying to him.     <Ocs.1.1.35.8>\"V\u00edm p\u00f8esn\u00ec, co c\u00edt\u00ed\u00b9.\"     <Oen.1.1.35.8>\"I know precisely what you are feeling.\"     <Ocs.1.1.35.9>\"V\u00edm v\u00b9echno o tv\u00e9m pohrd\u00e1n\u00ed, o tv\u00e9 nen\u00e1visti, o tv\u00e9m znechucen\u00ed.\"     <Oen.1.1.35.9>\"I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust.\"     <Ocs.1.1.35.10>\"Ale neboj se, jsem na tv\u00e9 stran\u00ec!\"     <Oen.1.1.35.10>\"But don't worry, I am on your side!\"     <Oen.1.1.35.11>And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.     <Ocs.1.1.36.1>To bylo v\u00b9e, a Winston si u\u00be nebyl jist, zda k tomu skute\u00e8n\u00ec do\u00b9lo.     <Oen.1.1.36.1>That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened.     <Ocs.1.1.36.2>Takov\u00e9 p\u00f8\u00edhody nikdy nem\u00ecly

enemies of the Party.     <Oen.1.1.36.4>Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all -- perhaps the Brotherhood really existed!     <Ocs.1.1.36.5>Navzdory

nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls -- once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition.     <Ocs.1.1.36.8>Sam\u00e9 dohady: nejpravd\u00ecpodobn\u00ecj\u00b9\u00ed je, \u00bee si to v\u00b9echno vymyslel.     <Oen.1.1.36.8>It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined

<Ocs.1.1.36.10>Ani ho nenapadlo, \u00bee by jejich chvilkov\u00fd kontakt mohl pokra\u00e8ovat.     <Oen.1.1.36.10>The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind.

Our inheritance law is based on three fundamental principles: a) testamentary freedom, b) inheritance within the family, and c) universal succession. Inheritance thus enables property relations, and other rights and obligations which arise from these relations, of the deceased person, to be transferred to other natural or legal persons.     Attorneys at Kri\u017eanec Law Firm provide legal representation in the field of inheritance law, where we have been representing our clients for over 50 years. In this challenging and complex field of law, a good attorney must protect the rights and interests of his clients in court and out-of-court proceedings with energetic performance, thorough preparation for each case and with an understanding of inheritance law as a whole.

Strengthening UNCAC and its Review Mechanism     Letter from the UNCAC Coalition to the UNCAC Implementation Review Group     Dear Chair, Bureau and Members of the UNCAC Implementation Review Group,     We are writing to you on behalf of the UNCAC Coalition and its Coordination Committee about the UNCAC Review Mechanism. We would like to commend UNCAC States Parties, the Implementation Review Group (IRG) and UNODC for the progress made to date in the first cycle of review of implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption.     In a period of economic uncertainty and with growing strains on public trust in government and the private sector, it is a matter of urgency to achieve advances in national and global action to curb corruption, using UNCAC as a framework. This can only be done through building alliances between all stakeholders committed to countering corruption.     With this in mind, we are sending this letter to you pursuant to Rules 2 and 17 of the Rules of Procedure of the UNCAC Conference of States Parties (COSP), which apply to the Implementation Review Group. We are also writing pursuant to COSP Resolution 4\/6 adopted at the 4th Conference of States Parties in Marrakesh in 2011 to report on some of our activities and contributions under that resolution. We are writing to report on our experiences under Resolution 4\/6 and to express our concerns about the exclusion of NGOs from Implementation Review Group meetings and from meetings of the Working Groups on Asset Recovery and Prevention. Civil society participation in international review mechanism bodies contributes to genuine dialogue and helps to improve law, policies, programmes and institutions at national level. This letter is submitted on behalf of the UNCAC Coalition by the Transparency and Accountability Network in the Philippines and by Transparency International.     Civil society activities and contributions under Resolution 4\/6 can be summarised as follows:     Resolution 4\/6 was a compromise reached among States Parties to hold briefings for NGOs on the margins of IRG meetings in order to build confidence in the contribution that can be made by NGOs as observers to the IRG, the key Review Mechanism body.[1] It was introduced as a temporary measure without suspending or nullifying the applicable Rules of Procedure of the COSP which provide that NGOs should be admitted as observers to IRG sessions.     The IRG briefing organised by UNODC in June 2012 allowed a useful exchange between NGOs and government delegations about the contributions of NGOs to the Review Mechanism. NGOs reported on their experiences at country level in UNCAC review processes, and also made contributions in the form of findings and recommendations regarding national implementation of the Convention. This led to a constructive discussion with government delegations.     NGOs also made written submissions to the IRG ahead of the briefing, including NGO parallel country reports and an overview report that aggregated our findings about the transparency and inclusiveness of the national level review processes, as well as commenting on and making proposals about some key implementation issues.     However, NGOs continue to be excluded from participating as observers in the IRG and in UNCAC Working Groups on Asset Recovery and Prevention.     Moreover, following the first constructive NGO briefing in June 2012, additional inappropriate restrictions have been placed on written and oral statements made by NGOs to the IRG. We are advised that written and oral statements that were accepted at the first briefing will no longer be accepted at the second one, including our Executive Summaries of NGO reports on national UNCAC implementation.     We would like to make to following observations about our experiences under Resolution 4\/6:     Restrictions on written submissions and oral statements     4. The restrictions placed on NGO written and oral statements to the IRG briefing limit our ability to report on our anti-corruption activities and assessments. They restrict meaningful dialogue and exchange of information between governments and other stakeholders about the UNCAC review process and UNCAC implementation.     5. These restrictions do not represent good UN practice, taking into account practices in other UN bodies, including convention review bodies.     6. The restrictions are incompatible with UNCAC obligations, including in Articles 5 and 13, to promote the participation of civil society.     Exclusion of NGOs as observers in the IRG     7. The exclusion of NGO observers from IRG sessions means we are unable to follow and contribute first-hand to the IRG discussions. This prevents NGOs from gaining a good understanding of this part of the Review Mechanism, from adding its experience and knowledge to the discussions and from helping to build public confidence in this body. It sends the message that the IRG\u2019s anti-corruption discussions are not intended to be known by the public. 8. The exclusion of NGOs from the IRG as observers is also inconsistent with combined Rules 2 and 17 of the Rules of Procedure of the UNCAC Conference of States Parties. (See the Opinion of the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs of 5 August 2010). Ignoring these rules undermines public confidence in UNCAC-related processes. 9. The exclusion of NGOs contravenes the letter and spirit of the Convention, including Articles 5, 10 and 13. The first of those articles requires governments to promote public participation and transparency. The second calls for transparency in public administration. The third requires policies to promote active public participation, effective public access to information and the freedom to seek, receive, publish and disseminate information concerning corruption. The principles and practices that States Parties commit to under the UNCAC are equally relevant at international level. To act otherwise, is to weaken the Convention and to undermine public faith in its potential.     Exclusion of NGOs as observers in the Working Groups     10. The exclusion of NGOs from attending as observers the Working Groups on Asset Recovery and Prevention prevents NGOs from gaining a good understanding of their work and contributing their knowledge and experience to their discussions. 11. NGOs are barred without any basis in any decision of the the Conference of States Parties. The COSP never held any discussions about excluding them and their exclusion in inconsistent with Rules 2 and 17 of the Rules of Procedure. (See the Opinion of the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs). 12. Again, the exclusion of NGOs from the Working Groups also contravenes the letter and spirit of the Convention, including Articles 5, 10 and 13.     In reflecting on our experience with Resolution 4\/6 we believe that application of the relevant Rules of Procedure would better serve the IRG and the UNCAC. Transparency enhances public understanding, builds trust and deters malfeasance. Participation of civil society assists and strengthens the hand of government officials working to address corruption. Cooperation among all stakeholders is essential to advance UNCAC implementation and counter corruption.     Yours sincerely,     Vincent Lazatin Transparency and Accountability Network Chair UNCAC Coalition Coordination Committee     Gillian Dell Transparency International Secretariat UNCAC Coalition     [1] That Resolution 4\/6 provides inter alia that (abbreviated language):     NGO briefings shall be conducted on the margins of the IRG about the outcomes of the review process, including on the technical assistance needs identified. Briefings shall be conducted on the basis of the IRG reports, thematic implementation reports and regional supplementary addenda. Non-governmental organizations can provide comments in writing in advance. Non-governmental organizations are encouraged to report\u2026 on their activities and contributions to the implementation of the recommendations and conclusions of the IRG approved by the COSP, including those related to meeting technical assistance needs and advancing capacity to effectively implement the Convention. Government delegations are requested to use the briefings \u2026to continue constructive dialogue on the contribution of non-governmental organizations to the Mechanism for the Review of Implementation of the Convention.

He used a collage and assemblage to integrate images as well as social and historical contexts. Monolithic plaster figures represent the management of the local industry or those who want to save this industry. The sculptures wear the first aid handbags, filled with coins and marked with the logotypes of local factories. Confronting them stands working class, dressed in shopping bags of the present large commercial chains. Although we feel the hidden nostalgia for the blooming industrial era in Kranj, which was replaced by the large international commercial chains, the author reminds us that we are witnessing the drop in quality, value and abilities of a man, who has surrendered to today\u2019s dictatorship of the capital.

      "text":" Address by Dr Dimitrij Rupel, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia at the 12th OSCE Ministerial Meeting, Sofia, Bulgaria     Mr Chairman,     Several decades ago Slovenian writer France Bevk decided that he had to get to know the Bulgarian nation. He thus embarked on a trip and brought back his impressions of your people, culture and history to the Slovenian public in the book \"Ten Days in Bulgaria\". In the book, he noted with excitement that he and his Bulgarian friends could speak their own languages and still understand each other. The book was published in 1938. What followed afterwards was a long period during which contact between our two peoples, despite the numerous cultural and linguistic links that bind us, was limited. This was due to specific historical circumstances, of which we are all aware. In the end it was the Helsinki Process that began bringing down the walls that kept us apart.     I therefore find special symbolism in taking over from you the role of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office. I believe this handover speaks volumes not only of the changes that have taken place since 1975, but also of the special mission and purpose of this organization. I am honoured to continue where you are leaving off. I would like to thank you and your staff for all the energy you put into your Chairmanship and for your efforts to reinvigorate the organization.     As a result of your dedicated work, this 12th Ministerial Council in Sofia leaves us with a number of important tasks. I attach special importance to the continuation of your efforts in reforming the OSCE, with a view to increasing its effectiveness and relevance. Other international organizations are constantly reforming and there is no reason why the OSCE should not do the same. I am therefore pleased that the decision on the Role of the Secretary General will strengthen his position as the Chief Administrative Officer of the OSCE. If there is no decision reached until end of this year, Slovenia as new Chairman-in-Office will start the process of appointing Secretary General of the OSCE from the beginning. I also welcome the establishment of the Panel of Eminent Personalities, which should provide new impetus to the much-needed assessment of our activities and the discussion on how our performance might be improved in light of the challenges that await us in the future.     Foremost among these challenges, in my view, is the current situation in the organization, which is characterized by a looming fissure in relations East and West of Vienna. Our inability to adopt a Political Declaration here in Sofia serves as a stark reflection of this regrettable reality. Sometimes it seems that the more we talk of no new dividing lines in Europe, the more we are confronted with them. I therefore read carefully the recent Moscow Declaration and the Astana Address. Let me underline the importance, which I attach to the Declaration of the nine Presidents of the CIS states. The Declaration would warrant serious consideration if only one Head of State signed it. As it is, it represents a resounding expression of dissatisfaction at the highest level, which has to be taken into account when looking at the work of the organization. I intend to work relentlessly to address this situation. After all, I firmly believe that there is so much more that unites us than divides us, in particular the foundations upon which our organization was built.     Our cooperation is all the more important in light of the important issues that require our serious attention. I refer, of course, to the current situation concerning the adoption of the new scales of contribution and, subsequently, the adoption of the 2005 budget before the end of this year. Without this, the very functioning of the organization would be in serious jeopardy. I therefore call on all the participating States to demonstrate their commitment to the OSCE through necessary flexibility in the on-going discussions. In this connection, I would like to remind you that next year will be the year of anniversaries; namely, the 30th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, the 15th anniversary of the Paris Charter, and the 10th anniversary of the OSCE, as well as the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords. Such events always serve as an opportunity both to look back and to try and chart the way forward. It would therefore not be becoming of us to begin this upcoming anniversary year without a budget. The organization is cost-effective, after all, and holds great promise and great potential. Sometimes this is clearer to those outside the OSCE than to us ourselves. I would therefore like to extend a special welcome here to Mongolia as a new Partner for Co-operation and express our readiness to assist it in establishing close relations with the organization.     As you can see, the agenda before us is a demanding one. Needless to say, it will be faithfully reflected in the program of the Slovenian Chairmanship, which I intend to present at the Permanent Council in Vienna this coming January 13. I can already tell you that in my work I will be guided by the following principles: focus on implementation; ensuring the continuity of the work of the organization; fostering adequate attention to all three dimensions; maintaining flexibility in addressing challenges as they arise; enhancing the geographic balance of OSCE activities through promotion of issues that are relevant to the entire OSCE area and through strengthening the cooperation with other international organizations, partner states and NGOs. I therefore count on your support in eliminating the divides among us. I also count on the able assistance of the OSCE Secretariat and the OSCE Institutions in the execution of all of these demanding tasks.     Slovenia approaches the great responsibilities that await us next year with the invaluable experience and knowledge acquired this year as a member of the Troika of the OSCE. I would therefore like to thank wholeheartedly our Dutch colleagues not only for the important contributions they made to the work of the organization during their previous Chairmanship, but also for all the advice and assistance they graciously shared with us during this period of our \"apprenticeship\". You will be missed.     I would also like to express our appreciation to our Belgian colleagues for the fruitful cooperation to date, which presents an excellent basis for the challenging work that awaits us next year. Together we are stronger.     In conclusion, I would like to say that my biggest concern at this moment is averting a potential stalemate in the organization, by encouraging the reengagement of all the participating States within the OSCE. In my view, this will be crucial - not only for the adoption of the organization's budget, but also - for the organization's future as such. Our renewed partnership would also have concrete consequences for the work of the OSCE in a number of areas, including the so-called \"frozen conflicts\". I would therefore like to conclude my remarks with the hope that next year we will celebrate the Thirtieth Anniversary of working for security and cooperation in Europe not only in words but in deeds as well.

Based on the KPI the picture for the decision-making has suddenly become much clearer: Excessive cases are highlighted, and this enables us to have a very quick review of indicators. Decision-makers are now empowered to decide based on relevant factors and act quickly.     Manufacturing companies are among the most data-intense industries. In the past, production companies could not harness and use all the data that was coming from the end-to-end manufacturing process. They had to rely on very complex, expensive tools that could only collect a limited amount of data from operators or machines.     In today\u2019s highly competitive world, waiting weeks or even days for an answer is no longer sufficient. Manufacturers need complete insight into the entire process, from supplier to the end customer. And to get a 360-degree view of their operations, they must take into account also external data like commodity and energy prices, weather, exchange rates etc. More the data they gather and more the data they manage to transform into useful information, better decisions they can make and with that improve and optimize their business.     Decision-makers need to get an answer right away, so waiting on generation of different reports for days or even weeks is not an option anymore.

      "text":" Comparing Two Partitions Obtained on Different Sets of Units     Location:     IBMI     Rand Index (Rand 1971) is known as one of the most common indices for comparing two partitions obtained on the same sets of units. It can take the value on the interval between 0 and 1 where higher value indicates more similar partitions. When measuring the similarity of two partitions the splitting and merging of clusters can be considered as factors with different effects on the value of an index. The Rand Index belongs to a group of symmetric indices in this context since both merging and splitting have a negative effect on the value of the measure. When the splitting and merging of groups have to be considered differently - according to the operationalization of studied groups - one of the Wallace indices can be used (Wallace 1983). Here, only the merging or only the splitting of groups lowers the value of an index.     In the case when two partitions are obtained on two different sets of units with a non-empty intersection, the number of in-coming and out-going units (e.g., when the sets of units are obtained in different time points) can be considered as a factors which lowers the value of an index. Therefore the two symmetric modified Rand indices and two asymmetric Wallace indices will be presented along with the correction for chance, which enables to compare the values of indices obtained on different partitions.     Quick Menu     About IBMI     Institute for Biostatistics and Medical Informatics (IBMI), formerly Institute for BioMedical Informatics (so still IBMI) was founded by the Faculty of Medicine as a result of a need for a unit which would perform, or coordinate, tasks related to data analysis and providing information, relevant for research in medicine.

      "text":" Digital transformation and freedom \"for\"     29.8.2017     Digital technology already provides extraordinary ways of connecting. Cooperation at personal level, within organisations or between organisations has been freed from old, clumsy and time-consuming operations. Thinking about the future of digital, technologically advanced world, freed from the old patterns of connecting and cooperation, I see a parallel with the concept of freedom \"from\" and freedom \"for\".     In very simplified terms, freedom \"from\" denotes being free from restrictions forced on an individual by others. The history is full of fights and revolutions in the name of liberation from such restrictions. Freedom \"from\" is an extremely important achievement, but can itself be a destructive force if it is not upgraded by freedom \"for\", with creativity and positive use of this liberty in order to live up to all our potentials. This requires true connection with others, which goes beyond the surface links of a conventional social relationship and well-established interactions, and leads to an entirely new form of connection with the whole world and self-realisation.     In practice, an increasing number of organisations recognise the positive effects of digital transformation on business results and on the relations and ways of cooperation within the organisation and outside it. There is an increasing number of those who accepted this technologically enabled freedom \"from\" the old patterns. However, what is important is the next step \u2013 realisation of freedom \"for\". What will be do with this new option for connecting?     If the present ways of cooperation are merely left to the inertia of technological progress, we can still reap the crops sown by digital transformation, but we cannot exploit all the potentials offered to us. I see the true creative potential of digital progress in a responsible setting up of a new system of cooperation, which will democratically include everybody, not only the rich and developed.     Robert Trnovec General Manager of the Adriatic Region at Microsoft and member of the Managers' Association "

      "text":" Tech up & cost down motion plastics for indoor cranes     Energy supply solutions for bridge cranes     In the area of crane systems, safe and fault-free cable guidance is extremely important for functional safety. As demands on travel distances, speeds, accelerations and precision are steadily increasing, the energy supply system and the cables must be able to withstand ever increasing loads. Installation, operation and maintenance should require a minimum of time and anticipated downtime. \"Off-the-peg solutions\" for indoor cranes and bridge cranes are rarely an option. Especially in the international market with its different conditions and standards, crane manufacturers and end users require multifunctional machines and variable components that can be easily adapted to the respective situation. All these requirements are met by igus with its versatile and extremely durable energy supply systems.     Benefits of igus products:     Save installation space and weight     Maintenance-free for 24\/7 use     Free sample box for indoor cranes     Convince yourself of the quality of our products for indoor cranes, ensure better machine performance and lower your costs.     White paper: efficient energy supply systems for cranes in steel plants     Modern steel production takes place in steel plants with increasingly high levels of integration. What technical challenges result from this for the transport and conveyor plant used, especially for the cranes in steel plants? How can an energy supply be achieved that is both reliable and efficient? There are two options: festoons and energy chains. What system has more advantages?     Guide trough     EC.PP trough-integrated path measurement system     The quick and easy to install position measuring system for every type of crane. Provide your crane with millimetre-accurate positioning and also create the possibility of integrating other smart plastics products, which further increases the safety and performance of the system.     Easy and quick to install     guidefast assembly The guidefast guide trough is ideal for moving motor cables on the crane. In the trough, an energy chain with the cables travels from A to B, thus ensuring a long service life, even with continuous load and the smallest bend radii.The guidefast can be installed on the crane in four simple steps:     Attach bracket     Connect the guide trough and screw on     Insert energy chain with cable and fasten     Connect trough joints with the help of clips     The guidefast control assembly The guidefast control cable guidance for crane control pendants is installed in a flash. The cables of the control pendant are guided in an energy chain, which maximises their life and minimises cable tangling.The guidefast control can be mounted on the crane in five simple steps:     Attach bracket     Connect guidefast guide troughs and screw on     Insert energy chain with cable and fasten     Insert guide carriage and connect with energy chain     Attach end stopper     Tested for real-world applications in the industry's largest test laboratory     Take a peek into the chainflex and e-chains test laboratory Have a look at our test laboratory for chainflex cables and e-chains, where tests are run for 10 billion cycles every year.     Long travels in field test In the case of long travels, e-chains are subjected to field testing with the help of sensors.     igus products being used successfully in indoor cranes     Process crane with igus rolling energy supply     In their hot rolling mill, Thyssen Krupp uses a slab transport crane from BANG Kransysteme GmbH & Co. KG, which is equipped with rolling energy supply systems from igus. The use with constant movement, small installation space, high temperatures and high dirt is no problem for the energy supply systems from igus. Temperatures around 70\u00b0C are reached even under the roof. No problem for the chainflex cables used. They are all equipped with a TPE jacket that can withstand high temperatures.     Harnessed energy supply systems for customer-specific indoor cranes     In many indoor cranes, the energy supply is implemented by means of loosely suspended festoonings that travel with the crane. By using igus energy chains, the required installation space can be reduced many times over, for example, to an installation space of 300 x 500 mm. By safely guiding the chain in a trough, the risk of failure of the entire system is also minimised.     Extremely space-saving energy supply     The e-spool\u00ae energy guide is a modular system. In this application, it could therefore be adapted individually to the requirements. Advantages for the user in this case were that the e-spool\u00ae energy supply is very space-saving, since the energy supply systems are right on the crane.     Safe cable guidance in waste incineration plant     In this waste incineration plant, the cables on the bridge crane are guided by igus' long-lasting e-chains. Since the e-chains are very tough, they are not easily intimidated by the harsh and dirty environmental conditions.

We prepare content of the protection, legislation, exhibitions, publications, and domestic and international projects.     Bled, Bled Island     You are here     The Bled Island is a cultural and historical monument of national importance. The island itself is a glacial formation that was created tens of thousands of years ago. The island got its current appearance through centuries of human activity. Archaeological findings indicate that the island was inhabited in the 7th century at the latest. The most important find was a large cemetery from the 8th and 9th century, when the first wooden church was erected on the island. The numerous grave goods found in the graves confirm the existence of an Old Slavonic cemetery or settlement which was part of the K\u00f6ttlach culture.     Restoration of the south stairway     Despite the buildings and the island having being extensively researched and renovated in the 1960s, the real transformation of the island into a cultural and tourism centre came with the restoration of the south stairway in 2004, which was performed by the Restoration Centre of the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage of Slovenia, and the preparation of the suitable documentation of all the buildings on the island.     Following the renovation     The vicar at Bled, Janez Ferkolja, should be credited for the revival of the island of Lake Bled, as he worked together with experts from the field of conservation and reviving cultural heritage to create a modern pilgrimage and tourism centre which preserves all the protected features of the cultural monument.

      "text":" The debris of a rocket fell to Earth on Sunday     Something went wrong with the take-off of a Chinese rocket on April 29th this year.     Part of the rocket fell off too quickly on take-off and began to fall to Earth.     When a rocket takes off into space, it usually sheds some of its parts during its flight through the atmosphere. Because of the lower mass, it uses less fuel when accelerating.     Parts that fall off at the beginning usually fall to Earth in a certain controlled area where they do not pose a danger.     Those that fall high enough, however, remain in the orbit and do not fall to Earth.     Due to an error, part of the Chinese rocket remained too close to Earth and began to fall back. This part weighed as much as 21 tons and flew at a speed of about 28 thousand kilometres per hour.     At such a high speed, it was difficult for researchers to predict the exact location of the fall back to Earth.     \u00bbWe predicted that the fall would happen somewhere around the equator, at most to the north to Rome or to the southern coast of Montenegro,\u00ab says Prof. Dr. Toma\u017e Zwitter from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics.     The debris of the rocket fell into the Indian Ocean west of the Maldives on Sunday, May 9th, at 3.24 pm our local time.     Uncontrolled falls of massive bodies do not happen often.     \u00bbAccording to the rules, before entering the atmosphere the body must be broken into several smaller pieces with an explosive charge, which then all burn without difficulty and therefore nothing falls to the ground,\u00ab says Zwitter.     Even before the fall of the debris of the rocket, Toma\u017e Zwitter believed that they did not pose a major danger.     \u00bbWalking on the sidewalk along the road is much more dangerous, as many accidents happen around the world every day. So no worries and just bravely go on!\u00ab     Points to Consider     What is gravity?     Why do bodies burn when they fall to Earth?     Which country was the first to launch a rocket into space?     ***     The original version of this article was published on May 10th.

      "text":" PUPPET THEATRE GROUP     The Puppet theatre group enables children and adolescents to express themselves through various theatrical techniques and test themselves on stage. In addition to personally get familiar with the tools of theatrical expression, children and adolescents can have a crack at appearing on stage.     The puppet theatrical workshops reinforce expressiveness and creativity, stimulate play, development of speech and self-confidence, which we need for public speaking. Children can express their emotions with puppets more easily, and they are more easily absorbed in the character they play. The puppet helps them to constructively talk, listen, participate and stay focused.     During workshop we play a lot and experiment when rehearsing and improvising. This leads us to be creative and full of ideas. We look for interesting stories that can be staged in a way that is fun for the public.     At the same time, we learn to function in a group, express our feelings, lose fear of expressing them, and overcome stage fright. We are responsible, motivated, we accept ourselves and others and we listen to and are heard. We experiment a lot and act and complement each other and then we make a story, which we then practice for the performance.     This kind of work and creation strengthens us personally strengthens, connects, develops our self-esteem and humour, and gives us pleasure and joy when we make others laugh.     At rehearsals, we learn to resolve conflicts constructively, test what is new, which leads us to our further development. We stick to the basic theatrical rule: \"Less is more!\" We also attach great deal of importance to give place importance to the performances that round off our path to normalization and deinstitutionalization. We participate in events both inside and outside the institution.

A product has to be returned to the company 14 days after the notification of withdrawal at the latest. If a consumer returns a product within 14 days of the acceptance of delivery, such is deemed a withdrawal. A product has to be unused, undamaged and in unchanged quantity, in original packaging and with a valid invoice. In case of a refund claim, please inform us in advance at the email address info@bock.si. Send your claim for return of a product to: BOCK d.o.o., Dra\u017ego\u0161ka ulica 2, 4000 Kranj.

The seller is not liable for damage due to improper maintenance. A buyer can return a product via mail. We do not accept collect on delivery shipments! If a complaint is justified, a buyer has an option to exchange a product for an equal one or similar one, to exchange it for any other product from our offer, or decide for a refund in which case we transfer the money to their account. If a complaint is not justified, a product is returned to the buyer, who is then charged for the costs of shipment. Uncollected products and unjustified complaints are no obstacle to buyer\u2019s duty to pay the claim. COMPLAINTS AGAINST PRODUCTS DAMAGED DURING TRANSPORT These kind of complaints may be filed within 3 days after the receipt of shipment. Later claims will unfortunately not be considered. If at the time of delivery, you should notice that the parcel has been damaged, we ask you to kindly decline the shipment and request the postal worker to draft a complaint record regarding damaged the parcel.

      "text":" Overlooked treasures of biomass     More than half of Slovenia\u2019s land is forests, which puts us among EU countries with the widest relative forest cover. However, that is not all! Along with wood biomass, green residuals, annual plants, exotic invasive plant species and biomass waste from agriculture and industry represent a rich source of raw materials, which can replace the ones we, until now, had to import. World average stats show we use wood biomass mostly for energy utilisation (53 %) as the rest is used in wood processing (28 %) and paper production (11 %). It seems very clear we are failing to use biomass effectively, considering its potential to give us wide range of biomaterials as end products or input materials for various industries, such as paper and textile production, polymer industry and other manufacturing industries. Effective cascade use of biomass is opening a window of opportunity to develop numerous new bio-based materials with matching or superior characteristics than fossil-based materials in many existing products. We intend to replace them. By doing so, we help reducing burden on the environment. We also create a continuous flow for materials and products to be re-used or recycled in a nature-friendly manner at the end of their life cycle. The so far discarded potentials of biomass represent a tremendous business opportunity for us and, by enforcing change in social and economic relations, we are getting another chance to regain a long lost nature's trust.     Developing new technologies and value chains     Partners in this programme aim to discover full potential of integrated and cascade use of biomass through comprehensive research and by systematically collecting and recording our findings. We are determined to develop and optimise new, sustainable technologies and procedures to lead us to useful biomass components, which can be later used as environmentally acceptable and renewable materials and products. Whatever biomass residue should remain at the end of it all, we will convert it into energy. Various research-production circles interconnect within this programme. They create new value chains with a common goal \u2013 optimal material utilisation of biomass throughout the circuit. Mastery knowledge base of research institutions intertwines with production\/manufacturing competences of industry through entire process, from developing fundamental knowledge to industrial application. Partners from industry actively participate as early as initial phase of basic research by supplying relevant information about what results they expect and what is essential for the knowledge to be applicable in the industry. By doing so we can ensure that the search for new findings is focused on needs and demands, clearly stated by the industry as end user, thus allowing for successful market uptake and following principles of closed materials loops. All mentioned above demands a tight partner cooperation, high level of trust and creativity as well as open communication at all stages of process and between all value chains.     But the reward for these endeavours is priceless.     Our contribution to development of knowledge and technologies on bio source utilization: * Database on availability, characteristics and usability of various types of biomass. * Advanced processes for fractionation of biomass. * Effective continuous processes for production of nanocellulose from various types of biomass. * Fibres and materials treatment technologies for improvement of functional properties. * Technologies in production of fibre webs and biocomposites. * Technologies and processes for biological treatment of waste and enzyme production. * Efficient processes for mechanical treatment of solid waste and materials recovery. * Innovative technologies for energy recovery of waste materials flows.     Dimensions of business opportunities     Nowadays market requests for green products are growing stronger and stronger. Competitive advantage on current and emerging markets is determined \u2500 more than rightly so \u2500 by increasingly stringent requirements regarding environmental and health protection. Demands are reflected in the search for locally available and renewable materials, in introducing technologies for material processing and product manufacturing with lower environmental burden and, in introducing efficient processes for re-use of discarded products. EU encourages ecological innovation, interdisciplinary and intersectoral clustering to boost economic competitiveness, green growth and green jobs. We want to ensure our place on this market. Just by trying to replace existing fossil-based products or their components of fossil origin with bio-based ones, we are significantly enhancing our option set for development of marketable solutions with high added value. If we act the same way within existing production processes \u2013 by using sustainable technologies and environmentally acceptable additives \u2013 our option set gets even wider. Lastly, as we take advantage of combined superior knowledge and industrial competences to create something completely new, not sky, only our imagination is the limit.     Partners in this programme have envisioned so much of this already.     Our contribution to development of bio-based products and components: * Green chemicals to be used in coating, resin and adhesive industries. * Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) and nanofibrilated cellulose (NFC) produced from residual biomass. * Paper\/board with improved existing and new functional properties. * Smart packaging with printed sensors. * Active yarns with functionalized cellulose fibres. * Bio-based filtering materials. * Lightweight and thermostable bio-composites for different applications. * Cellulose-based battery separators. * High-performance cellulose-based insulating materials. * Enzymes, produced from biological decomposition of waste. * Innovative system for energy recovery from waste with high water containment.     Social dimensions     Efficient use of primary and waste biomass is not just a beneficial economic decision. It is also critical and urgent societal decision, which in its processes necessarily involves a wider social environment. It encourages every single one of us to begin to understand our multiple societal roles in context of their interconnectedness. How? As empowered consumers, we have an obligation to demand quality products \u2013 with high longevity and biodegradable. As subjects in economy sphere, we are obliged to search for the best choices in means of production \u2013 locally available, multifunctional and renewable. And as people, inhabiting this joint living space, we are bound to co-habit it responsibly, to act towards restoring and maintaining it. This programme represents a unique example of enforcement of circular economy principles. By connecting various value chains following a common goal \u2013 effective cascade use of biomass, we aim to:     * reduce dependence on foreign sources of raw materials, * replace fossil based raw materials, * establish efficient systems of closing materials loops, * exploit opportunities on the growing market of green solutions, * connect local competencies into innovative circular partnerships, * strengthen local socio-economic relations, * encourage society as a whole to act towards green co-existence and thus * contribute significantly to reducing the burden on the environment.     By exploiting nature, we help preserve it. And empower ourselves.     Desire to introduce sustainable practices, where economic benefits give way to reflections about our common future, have created a need to form quality partnership relations. By turning to local ritches when providing raw materials for processing, production of goods and, later on, their decomposition, recycling and re-use, we can create efficient, self-sufficient production circles. And introduce circular economy. But in order to introduce it properly, real partnerships had to be formed. Here we are, 21 partners, top research teams mastering materials, chemical engineering, processing technologies, biotechnologies, nanotechnologies and energy engineering, joined by key experiential partners and industry end-users from fields of chemical, textile, paper, timber and automotive industry, civil and energy engineering. AND YOU!     ABOUT     Strategic direction of the programme is to exploit the potential of biomass for development of advanced materials and bio-based products, by creating new value chains for cascading use of biomass. The programme is placed within priority area S4 - The natural and traditional resources for the future, Networks for the transition to the circular economy - and is co-financed by EU Structural Funds in Slovenia. It comprises all of the identified focus areas and technologies: technologies for development of new bio based materials, technologies for utilisation of secondary and raw materials and reuse of waste and technologies for production of energy from alternative sources.

      "text":" RESPECT Policy Workshop, 2-3 July 2013, Ljubljana, Slovenia     In addition to a valid travel document, third-country nationals must hold a visa in order to enter the Republic of Slovenia. A visa is a permit issued by a relevant diplomatic mission or consular post of the Republic of Slovenia to a third-country national. If the circumstances under which a visa was issued have changed, border authorities may refuse entry and cancel the visa.     A list of third countries whose nationals must hold a short-stay visa is available on the web site of the Slovenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Further explanation of variations in the visa regime is available in the section 'Who does not need a visa?'.     The Free Travel Guide is recommended for general information on how to reach Ljubljana.     Slovenian airlines Adria airways supply flights for the Ljubljana airport, thus connecting the capital with many European cities. Ljubljana is easily accessible by car due to a well developed network of roads:     - from Trieste (Italy) E 61\/E 70 (110 km) - from Zagreb (Croatia) E 70 (120 km)     - from Villach (Austria) E 651 (100 km)     - from Klagenfurt (Austria) E 652\/E 61 (85 km)     Slovenia has a developed network of railways, connecting Ljubljana with Graz and Klagenfurt (Austria) to the north and Trieste (Italy) to the west. Ljubljana's main train station, simply called \"Ljubljana\", is within an easy walk to the city centre.     The web site of the Ljubljana Bus station (Avtobusna postaja Ljubljana) offers timetables for all local bus connections, including the plan of the bus routes. The ticket office is open daily from about 5.00 or 5.30 till 22.30. For most of the routes you can buy the tickets directly from the driver. Please have small denomination Euro notes and coins ready.     To ride the city buses in Ljubljana, you must first purchase an Urbana card (similar to an Oyster Card in London). These can be bought at self-service stations (\"Urbanomat\") found at the larger bus stops across the city, LPP sales sites, Tourist Information Centers and newspaper agents for \u20ac2 and need to be loaded with an amount ranging from \u20ac1 to \u20ac50. Upon entering the bus by the front door, you need to position the card next to the reader to pay for the route. The confirmation is a quiet beep and an illuminated green light, while a negative response is a louder beep and a red light. After that, you proceed to take your seat \/ stand. "

      "text":" Break dance     It's not easy to master the basic elements of breakdance. First you have to build upper body strength and improve your balance. But once you overcome these first obstacles, it gets easier. Baby freeze, helicopter, kick up and turtle are only a few of the basic elements which we learn right at the beginning. And, of course, the famous six step, which our breakdance teachers quickly upgrade to a three step.     In order to provide you with the best online experience this website uses cookies.

Today the National Gallery of Slovenia.     The National Gallery of Slovenia (Narodna galerija) is the main art museum in Slovenia that holds the country's largest fine art collection from the late medieval period up to the early twentieth century. It was founded as early as 1918 as the National Gallery Society with the aim of establishing a museum for Slovenian fine arts. First housed in the Kresija Palace, the Gallery relocated to the Narodni dom palace in 1926.     A completely reorganised and expanded permanent exhibition of the collections returned to public view in January 2016, following an extensive renovation of the Narodni dom palace.     History     Narodni dom (National House) building by Franti\u0161ek \u0160kabrout, built in Ljubljana 1894\u20131896. In 1927 the National Gallery of Slovenia rented some rooms in the building that housed also sport and leisure activities. Postcard, 1910.     The National Gallery of Slovenia was founded in 1918 as the National Gallery Society with the aim of establishing a museum for Slovenian fine arts. The National Gallery was originally housed in the Kresija Palace, where the first Permanent Exhibition was opened to the public in 1920. The Gallery relocated to the Narodni dom Palace in 1926, where it remains to this day. During the German occupation, the Gallery collections were relocated to the basements of the National Museum and the National and University Library. After the war, on 1 July 1946, the National Gallery of Slovenia became a state institution.     In the 1980s, the Gallery embarked on an expansion and renovation project that lasted for four decades. In 1988, the Gallery acquired the premises of the neighbouring Club of Delegates and in 1993 completed the New Wing in its lot. In 2001, the glass Entrance Hall, which connects the Narodni dom Palace and the New Wing, was completed. The Robba Fountain was placed inside the Entrance Hall in 2008. In 2009 the Gallery began the renovation of the Narodni dom Palace, which reopens in January 2016.     Next to permanent exhibition premises, there is an exhibition area for temporary exhibitions, educational activities and the National Gallery of Slovenia Library.     Collections     After its foundation in 1918, the Gallery succeeded in a relatively short time in bringing together works from both public and private collections, including works by Slovenian artists purchased by the City of Ljubljana and works belonging to the Society for Christian Art; it also began to systematically purchase other works of art. An important acquisition was 90 paintings from the Strahl Collection. In 1927 the Gallery ordered casts of classical sculptures from the Louvre and in 1934 augmented its collection with fine art works belonging to the National Museum of Slovenia. After the Museum of Modern Art opened in 1947, many of the National Gallery's 20th-century works were transferred to the new museum. Throughout the Gallery\u2019s history, numerous works of art were donated and bequeathed to the institution by artists themselves or their relatives, collectors, companies and individuals.     Today the Gallery's collection comprises 3,500 paintings, 1,000 pieces of sculpture, over 8,000 works on paper, and around 20,000 documents, thus taking care for the works of art by more than 1,000 artists. A selection of artworks is also accessible online.     The Permanent Collection of the National Gallery of Slovenia could be subdivided into Art in Slovenia, European Painters, Government Art Collection, Collection of Zoran A. Mu\u0161i\u010d (1909\u20132005), and a Special Collection.     A Collection of Zoran A. Mu\u0161i\u010d (1909\u20132005), a Slovene Modernist painter who established himself in the international art world (Venice and Paris), comprises 57 artworks that were donated to the gallery in 2014 by the artist\u2019s niece, with further 40 works on loan. The Government Art Collection comprises over 1300 works of art that were acquired directly by the government, mostly after the Second World War, and kept in ministry and government buildings. The Gallery became the custodian of the collection in 1986. A Special Collection consists of a collection of posters, calendars and documents from the personal archives of Slovene artists who worked in the late 19th and in the first half of the 20th century.     The 2016 set up of the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Slovenia in the grand hall.     Permanent exhibition set anew     As the premises were expanded, in January 2016 a permanent exhibition was reinstalled: it features a new selection of works from all the collections arranged chronologically, covering the period between the 13th and the early 20th century.     Temporary exhibitions programme     The museum's programme counts approximately 4 major and 15 small-scale exhibitions per year. The majority of them are prepared by the house curators, some are acquired by exchange with international institutions or prepared by other Slovene organisations (e.g. Biennial of Slovene Visual Communications).     International Cooperation     On 17 April 2013 the exhibition Slovenian Impressionists and their time (1890\u20131920), curated by Sylvain Lecombre and Barbara Jaki, opened at the Petit Palais Museum in Paris. To date, it was the largest exhibition of Slovenian art in Western Europe.     The Gallery works together with many European art museums and institutions, including Uffizi Gallery, Italy; National Sculpture Museum of Spain, Spain; National Museum in Warsaw, Poland; University of Galway, Ireland; Regional Council of Lower Normandy, France; Finnish National Gallery, Finland; and Gallery of Matica srpska, Serbia.     Slovene Impressionism and their Time 1890\u20131920 exhibition at Petit Palais, Paris , 2013     The Robba Fountain     Francesco Robba (1698\u20131757), whose oeuvre connected Ljubljana with contemporary Venetian art, created the fountain between 1743 and 1751, and modelled it on the famous Roman fountains. The sculptures of the three river gods decorating it most probably represent three rivers in the then province of Carniola, namely the Sava, the Ljubljanica and the Krka. The original fountain was removed from Ljubljana's Mestni trg Square and replaced by a copy. The original, refurbished and restored, now resides in the Entrance Hall of the National Gallery of Slovenia.     The restored Robba Fountain by Baroque sculptor Francesco Robba was installed in the National Gallery of Slovenia entrance hall in 2006.     Music programme     Since 2001 the National Gallery hosts each year a cycle of concerts by the Slovene Philharmonic String Chamber Orchestra, entitled Harmony of the Spheres [Sozvo\u010dja svetov]. The events combine lectures on fine arts with concerts of chamber music, which include pieces from the classical repertoire and original compositions.     Education Department     The Education Department of the Gallery was founded in 1961 and is among the oldest in the country. Children\u2019s programming encourages art exploration through the adventures of Gal the Dwarf, the mascot of the Gallery since 1981, setting up the Motivational Gallery exploration space, called Gal\u2019s Room, in the gallery. Education Department each year organizes around 200 public events and welcomes more than 20,000 young visitors.     Artworks loan, venue hire     The National Gallery also loans its artworks and photo material for exhibitions and publications, according to international standards. It is also possible to hire the gallery spaces for events.

Customer reviews     Napi\u0161ite Va\u0161u Recenziju     The Ultralight 10x42 binoculars (New! with dielectrical)     The universal hiking and stalk hunting binoculars by DDoptics are available as the high luminosity 42mm version since August 2015. Small, light, handy and high-performance are the characteristics of universal hiking and stalk hunting binoculars. Of course the Ultralight also has to be watertight and sturdy. And these small binoculars are also just beautiful. The open bridge literally invites the hand to firmly grasp the tube and offers handiness and comfort. The coating of the prisms and lenses of the Ultralight binoculars with 42mm objective diameter have even been coated with a dielectrical. This ensures a bright and pleasant image and once the bincoulars are not needed anymore they disappear without further ado inside a jacket pocket. The small weight of barely 650g of the Ultralight binoculars never hampers. The best thing about these binoculars is that one likes to have them around.     Best suited for outdoor vacation and bird watching even during progressing twilight     In the mountains or at the North Sea, at minus 15 degrees Celsius or in the desert. The watertight and nitrogen filled Ultralight can do it all and still offers a good image. Up until twilight it helps to find the right path and shows small surprises here and there which you would never have discovered without your reliable companion. Now, the 10x42 Ultralights are better suited for use during twilight and night. Besides a bigger objective opening there is also a noticeably better transmission.     Price-performance ratio is a priority!     With the Ultralight 10x42 we offer optics which can do everything one expects from such a midget. In this price category there are almost no open bridges to be found.     Sturdy workmanship for heavy outdoor use     The tubes are made of ultra hard and break-proof polycarbonate. All critical places like the eyecups and the \"kink\" are made of metal alloys.     Fine mechanics     The focussing wheels runs freely and without any play. Not too hard, not too soft, and it's easy to get to the \"acuity point\" during fine-adjustment. The diopter set underneath the right ocular is clearly and precisely adjustable. The eyecups have 4 changeable steps so that spectacle wearers as well as non spectacle wearers can adjust to the perfect and most comfortable eye distance. "

      "text":" Goran Bogdanovski     dancer and performer, choreographer, teacher, curator, artistic director     Goran Bogdanovski (photo: Ur\u0161ka Boljkovac)     Over the course of his career as dancer and performer, Goran Bogdanovski (1971, Ljubljana) collaborated with over 70 choreographers and theatre directors in a range of dance genres (ballet, physical theatre, contemporary dance, video etc.). Between 1989 and 2000 he was a member of the Slovenian National Theatre Opera and Ballet Ljubljana, while also working freelance with different artists in Slovenia and abroad.     In 2000 Goran founded Fi\u010do Balet (Ficho Ballet) which he uses as a vehicle for developing his artistic expression through innovative dance productions and creative workshops. He is involved in dance-based programming for international projects and festivals as well as active as a dance pedagogue. Since 2000 he has choreographed and produced 15 artistic projects, which were presented to international audiences from Moscow to New York. Goran is the recipient of several prestigious awards, among them also the 2004 UNESCO Aschberg Award (Montreal). He is the artistic and managing director of Fi\u010do Balet since its establishment in 2000.     In 2003 Goran launched, together with several partners, Gibanica (Moving Cake), Biennial of Slovenian Contemporary Dance Art, the first Slovenian dance platform to showcase and promote Slovenian contemporary dance. In response to the inefficient systems for creating and producing contemporary dance in Ljubljana, Goran proposed and realised the initiative for a new and much needed rehearsal space at Kino \u0160i\u0161ka and also acted as its manager until 2009, when the spaces were renovated in cooperation with Asociacija, Association of Arts and Culture NGOs and Freelancers, and the Municipality of Ljubljana and renamed Kino \u0160i\u0161ka Centre for Urban Culture. In 2005 he instigated an international education-research project NOMAD Dance Academy with partners from six countries in the region to fill the lack of opportunities for research and education in contemporary dance. He was also involved in the constitution of the Centre of Contemporary Dance Art and the Slovenian Contemporary Dance Network. As curator he worked on numerous projects, among them the project of European dance houses Modul-dance, the international laboratory TryAngel and international festivals CoFestival and at\u0160i\u0161ka!.     Goran has passed on his knowledge and understanding of dance to over 1.000 individuals and groups (dancers, actors, choreographers, students, professors, artists, producers, pedagogues, directors, managers, software designers \u2026) in 23 countries across the world through dance classes, workshops, research projects, artistic creations, coaching and mentoring.     Goran\u2019s teaching method is a synthesis of dance techniques and tools that he has been experimenting with and developing over the past 20 years. They range from classical ballet to martial arts, from modern and contemporary dance to Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Kundalini and dynamic meditations, from contact to theatre improvisation, underpinned by his vast experience as a maker and co-maker in the area of performing arts. Goran\u2019s teaching is based on improvisation, presence, group awareness and dynamics and, especially, on artistic creativity.     Besides teaching regularly in Ljubljana, Goran has held workshops and training in the following countries: Austria, Germany, Belgium, Georgia, Azerbaijan, USA, Ukraine, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Poland, Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Slovenia\u2026 "

      "text":" History and tradition     The Velenje Coal Mine operates the largest Slovenian coal deposits and one of the thickest known coal layers in the world. 165 metres thick, its lignite layers have enabled production of over 220 million tonnes of lignite so far. Piled on wagons, it would make up a train that could encircle the Earth twice.     First mention of the coal deposits goes back to the 18th century, first drilling to 1975, and first mines to 1887.     Daniel pl. Lapp was the first one to succeed in producing relevant amounts of lignite after the main lignite layer had been discovered in 1875, the year regarded as the \u201cbirth\u201d of the Velenje coal mine. After the first shaft had been opened, miners managed to keep increasing the scope of production despite exclusively manual work. One of the contributing factors was a new railway line, which enabled sales to distant consumers.     The first thermal power plant, lignite-based, was built near the coal mine back in 1905. Coal mining in the \u0160ale\u0161ka valley experienced its biggest boom after World War II, when the demand for coal skyrocketed.     Coal production continued to increase until 1990\u2019s. The Velenje Coal Mine accounted for as much as three quarters of all Slovenian coal. Modern equipment and the company\u2019s own coal mining method could barely cover the demand for coal in 1980\u2019s. It was the former country\u2019s appetite for energy that made the Velenje Coal Mine reach its peak annual coal production, 5 million tonnes of coal, in mid 1980\u2019s.     Nowadays, the lignite produced in Velenje is used to power the \u0160o\u0161tanj Thermal Power Plant, which uses the annual coal output to generate one third of all electric power consumed in Slovenia.     The importance of Premogovnik Velenje is measured not only by its ability to meet this fundamental need of the society, but also by the direct impact the coal mining activity has on the environment, as well as by its attitude towards the environment.     The latter relates above all to ties with the local community and its people. Working countless volunteer hours, miners built Velenje with their own hands, thus providing for a strong relation between the development of the town and coal mining.     The influence of the Coal Mine continues to this day. The company supports and encourages sports, cultural, and educational activities. Developed on a site formerly damaged due to coal mining, Tourist and sports resort Jezero now brings together numerous people with its sports grounds, nature, and sports and social events. In 1999, the Coal Mining Museum of Slovenia was established in an abandoned part of the \u0160kale mine, where visitors can experience the development of coal mining in Slovenia. "

The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Launch of the Eurosystem\u2019s pan-European solution for instant payments     11\/30\/2018 \/ Press release     On 30 November 2018 the Eurosystem launched its new pan-European solution for instant payments, the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement or TIPS.     This allows firms and individuals across the EU (provided that the payer\u2019s and payee\u2019s banks are participants in TIPS) to exchange euro payments:     in a few seconds; the payee receives the funds in his\/her\/its account at the same speed as an email or SMS;     at any time; payments can be made via TIPS 24 hours a day, every day of the year;     at the pan-European level; TIPS provides for the execution of domestic and cross-border payments in the same way.     The development of TIPS began in 2016, and with the aim of ensuring that its attributes are tailored to market requirements has proceeded at all times in close cooperation with the commercial banks and other stakeholders in the field of payments. TIPS has accession conditions that are open and harmonised at EU level, and thus banks from the entire EU can participate in it.     With the aim of ensuring that the largest number of banks join TIPS as quickly as possible, thus allowing instant payments to be made in euros between as many firms and individuals as possible (ideally all) from the entire EU, the Eurosystem is offering TIPS services at low fees. Initially banks participating in TIPS will not be charged fees, then later, for at least the first two years of the functioning of the system, a maximum fee of EUR 0.002 will be charged for the execution of an individual payment, with no additional fees.     Slovenian banks can participate in TIPS via the Bank of Slovenia, by opening a special account at the Bank of Slovenia and putting in place the technical support for connecting to TIPS. The Bank of Slovenia will allow accounts of this type to be opened once TIPS goes live, i.e. as of 30 November 2018. "

      "text":" How can religion and comedy be related if the former tries to keep things untouchable while the latter revels in feeling stuff up? But what if our laughter also idolizes the mocked, admiring their reckless disregard for social norm? And what if, by raising God up as special we also make him a great target for collective mockery? In Sveto in sme\u0161no ('The Holy and the Funny') cartoonist and philosopher Izar Luna\u010dek walks us through the history of both comedy and religion to show that their ancient quarrel might well stem from having grown up in a common household. And assembling an erray of local myths he seeks to demonstrate that the brothers' split is mostly a thing of modern, single-God religions while older and more local faiths liked to let funny gods play in their pantheons and even put them on par with the main deity.     After attaining degrees in painting and philosophy plus a PhD in the latter, Izar Luna\u010dek (1979) left academia to draw comics and organise the local ninth art scene, establishing Ljubljana's central comic book shop and the city's comic festival. This book takes him back to his theorising roots as he takes on the task of presenting a complex, multi-layered topic through a combo of funny pictures and short, sweet sentences. Who knew hard-core philosophy could be this fun to read? If you want to be funny, you need to keep a straight face, while gods usually laugh last ... Still sure you know which is which? "

      "text":" Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease which is also referred to as infectious jaundice, as infection with the hepatitis A virus can lead to liver inflammation with symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, fever and the appearance of yellow pigmentation of the skin and conjunctivas. The symptoms occur within 15-50 days of infection. Interestingly, the symptoms and severity of the disease depend upon the age of the infected person. In most adults infected with the virus, the disease causes jaundice, and it is fatal for approximately 2% of persons over the age of 50. In some cases, the disease only lasts for a few weeks, but for a minority, issues related to liver inflammation can persist for up to a year. In contrast to adults, however, the disease mostly manifests itself in a milder form in children, even without jaundice. But while they may not experience problems, they shed the virus in their excrement, thus causing the spread of infection among people in their vicinity; infected persons shed the hepatitis A virus in their excrement up to 10 days before the onset of symptoms, when they themselves are not yet experiencing any medical problems, and for some days after the onset of jaundice. If infected persons do not practice good hygiene, the virus is given a constant source of food, and if sanitary conditions are inadequate, it can even find its way into drinking water. The hepatitis A virus is contracted through direct contact with an infected person and by ingesting contaminated food or water. Raw or inadequately thermally processed mussels, in which viruses are accumulated from the contaminated sewage which flows into the sea, also present a risk of infection.     Hepatitis A occurs throughout the world. The risk of infection in developed countries such as Slovenia is actually very low. There is, however, a medium-high or even very high risk of infection in the countries of Africa, Central and South America, the whole of Asia with the exception of Japan and Singapore, and some countries of Eastern and Southeast Europe. 10 to 20 cases of hepatitis A are recorded in Slovenia per year. But in our immediate surroundings and in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, where Slovenians travel most often, there are as many as several hundred or even several thousand cases of hepatitis A per year, sometimes even in the form of epidemics. One of the largest hepatitis A epidemics occurred at the turn of 2007 in Serbia, predominantly in Ni\u0161 and its surroundings. Serbia recorded a total of almost 5000 cases of the disease in 2007 and 2008.     In less developed parts of the world, most of the population is infected during their childhood or early adulthood. In Slovenia, persons younger than 50 have mostly not come into contact with the virus in their entire lives, making them all the more at risk of infection when travelling to the abovementioned regions of the world, where there is a high risk of infection. In the countries of Western and Central Europe, more than half of all patients are infected while travelling abroad. The risk of infection depends upon the destination and duration of the trip, as well as the living conditions, food and drink safety standards and, of course, the sanitary conditions at the destination. Although the risk of infection can be reduced by practicing good hand hygiene, it is not possible to ensure that the persons who prepare and serve your food during your trip practice proper hygiene and handle the food correctly.     Even tourists who only visit holiday resorts in endemic countries for short periods of time and stay and eat at high-class hotels can develop a serious case of the disease. A good example of this is the hepatitis A epidemic which occurred among the guests of one of the all-inclusive high-class hotels in Hurghada, Egypt, in 2004, when at least 350 persons from 9 European countries became ill; most of them, 271, were from Germany. The cause of the infection was most likely the freshly squeezed orange juice served at breakfast. Regardless of the fact that Egypt is a country with a high risk of hepatitis A infection, most of the German tourists had not been vaccinated against the disease. After returning from Hurghada, an Austrian tourist also caused a local hepatitis A epidemic among the guests of the restaurant at which she worked. Because symptoms of hepatitis only begin to show in infected persons a few weeks after infection, while the virus begins to be shed before the disease develops, the hepatitis A virus was transmitted from the tourist onto 13 guests of the restaurant at which she worked.     Research shows, however, that the risk of infection has been decreasing in the past years for passengers travelling from developed countries to less developed parts of the world. Nonetheless, hepatitis A remains the most common travel-related disease, and it can be protected against by vaccination. Vaccination is actually the only effective way of preventing infection. Hepatitis A vaccine is a so-called dead vaccine and is thus entirely safe. It is also very effective, as it makes virtually all vaccinated persons immune as soon as a month after the first dose of the vaccine. The second dose, which is administered 6 months to a year after the first dose, ensures long-term protection. Current research shows that after the two doses are administered, vaccinated persons develop lifelong immunity, and booster doses are therefore no longer required under current doctrine.     The greatest risk of infection for Slovenian travellers is, of course, travelling to the countries of Africa, Asia and Central and South America, regardless of the duration of the trip and the living conditions. Despite the fact that most people think that taking a short holiday in holiday resorts in Turkey, Egypt, Tunis, Morocco and other popular destinations does not constitute a risk for infection with hepatitis A or other infectious diseases, actual data and research show that this is far from the truth. Considering the fact that Slovenians mostly travel to nearby destinations, it must be noted that there is a risk of hepatitis A infection even when travelling to or visiting friends or relatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia or Kosovo. International travel medicine experts are of the opinion that it is advisable to get vaccinated against hepatitis A before travelling to any of the aforementioned countries of the former Yugoslavia, as well as Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldavia, Ukraine, Belarus or Russia (more at http:\/\/www.drustvo-bpnb.si\/index.php\/english-articles\/202-vaccination-agains-hepatitis-a and http:\/\/www.drustvo-bpnb.si\/index.php\/english-articles\/204-vaccination-against-hepatitis-a-and-hepatitis-b).

His mother was an art historian,[7] his brother Andra\u017e is an artist, while his two sisters are Jelka a biologist and Katarina a literary historian. \u0160alamun died on 27 December 2014 in Ljubljana.[8][9]     Work[edit] In 1964, as editor of a literary magazine Perspektive he published his iconoclastic poem \u201cDuma \u201964\u201d (Thought \u201964), which was one of the reasons why Perspektive was banned and \u0160alamun was arrested by Titoist regime because one of its hard-liners, Ivan Ma\u010dek Matija, recognized himself in the (dead) cat from the poem (the Slovene word ma\u010dek means \u2018cat\u2019).[7] He spent five days in jail and came out something of a culture hero, but he refrained from including the poem in his first poetry book, which appeared in 1966 in a samizdat edition, full of absurdist irreverence, playfulness, and wild abandon.[6][10]     Poetry collections translated in English[edit] \u0160alamun has had several collections of poetry published in English, including The Selected Poems of Toma\u017e \u0160alamun (Ecco Press, 1998); The Shepherd, the Hunter (Pedernal, 1992); The Four Questions of Melancholy (White Pine, 1997); Feast (Harcourt, 2000), Poker (Ugly Duckling Presse), Row! (Arc Publications, 2006), The Book for My Brother (Harcourt), Woods and Chalices (Harcourt, 2008, translated by Brian Henry), There\u2019s the Hand and There\u2019s the Arid Chair (Counterpath, 2009), and On the Tracks of Wild Game (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2012). American poets that influenced him include Frank O\u2019Hara, John Ashbery and Walt Whitman.[1]     International reception[edit] America[edit] In July 1970, he was personally invited to exhibit his work at the MOMA.[11] \u0160alamun spent two years at the University of Iowa, including one year in the International Writing Program from 1971 to 1972, and lived for periods of time in the United States after that.[3] From 2005 to 2007 he taught at the University of Pittsburgh.     Slovenia[edit] For a time, he served as Cultural Attach\u00e9 to the Consulate General of Slovenia in New York. Literary critic Miklav\u017e Komelj wrote:[12] \u201c\u0160alamun\u2019s inventiveness with language has, indeed, never been more dynamic than in his most recent books. But in this dynamism there is also a monotone quality, which the poet makes no attempt to hide. It is as if this ecstasy resulted from spinning endlessly in a circle, like the whirling dervishes\u2014a religious order, incidentally, that was founded by the mystic Rumi, one of \u0160alamun\u2019s favorite poets\u2026.It seems that the intensity of \u0160alamun\u2019s language lies precisely in the endless insistence of its pulsation.\u201d     Prizes[edit] \u0160alamun won a Pushcart Prize, as well as Slovenia\u2019s Pre\u0161eren Fund Award and Jenko Prize. \u0160alamun and his German translator, Fabjan Hafner, were awarded the European Prize for Poetry by the German city of Muenster. In 2004, he was the recipient of Romania\u2019s Ovid Festival Prize.[13] "

In the performance, the authors expose and tackle the issue of dance stereotypes that faces all creators in the sphere of contemporary dance. By its humorous undertone and stage insanity, the performance \u201cDance me out, please\u201d, also effectively reflects the actual state of dance and dancers while attempting to dismantle the obsolete patterns that shape (superficial) public opinion on the function and position of contemporary dance.     The actress, dancers and the two choreographers unfold before us the sparkling layers of personal insights, stereotypes of popular culture, refined choreographies and improvisations whose visual image originates above all in the inspirations provided by everyday complicated situations. The Slovenian-Serbian connection was created in co-production of Plesni Teater Ljubljana. The dance tandem Rosana Hribar and Gregor Lu\u0161tek were awarded the first price for this performance at the 10th Festival of ballet miniatures in Belgrade in 2008, which is created in international cooperation with the BELEF center.

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Governor\u2019s statement following the ECB\u2019s monetary policy meeting     06\/11\/2021 \/ Press release     With what is now a more favourable epidemiological outlook, members of the Governing Council of the ECB deliberated yesterday over the improved economic forecast for the euro area. For this year, we expect a strong acceleration in economic activity, and the high growth rate will continue into the coming year. At the same time, despite this year\u2019s acceleration, inflation will remain below the desired level. Conditions on the financial markets remain stable.     These conditions are tied largely to our far-reaching policy measures. For this reason, the Governing Council has decided to retain all the measures put in place to date. The fact is that extensive support through monetary and fiscal policies is needed in order to maintain favourable conditions of financing and consequently to ensure a solid recovery and sustainable attainment of inflation close to our target.     With successful vaccination programmes, the epidemiological outlook in Europe is improving, and preventive measures to contain the spread of the virus are being eased. This is reflected in the macroeconomic picture: there is continued robust recovery in manufacturing, while in the services sector we have observed an acceleration in activity for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic. High-frequency data thus indicate that in the second quarter, after two successive quarters of slight contraction in economic activity, we can expect a sharp acceleration in economic activity.     The latest forecasts, which were discussed yesterday by the Governing Council, have economic growth reaching 4.6% this year. We also expect a similarly high growth of 4.7% in the coming year. In 2023 certain fiscal measures will expire, and the recovery period will be over, while growth will slow down somewhat to a level of 2.1%. GDP is expected to return to its pre-crisis level in the first quarter of 2022. Economic activity will be supported principally through factors of domestic demand, specifically through more generous fiscal measures and the recovery of private spending following the withdrawal of containment measures.     The increased domestic spending will also boost inflation slightly compared to 2020. Due to temporary factors such as the adjustment of oil prices relative to the previous year, the change in the weighting and the effect of raising VAT in Germany, inflation will jump to 1.9% in 2021. When these temporary and mainly supply-side factors fade, in the main scenario we expect inflation once again to fall slightly. In 2022 and 2023, we therefore anticipate growth of 1.5% and 1.4% respectively.     Such expectations are still accompanied by high risks, which for economic growth are now spread more evenly, while for inflation slightly higher growth in prices is expected.     Banka Slovenije expects to present new forecasts of economic trends relating to Slovenia in the coming days.     Conditions on the financial markets remained favourable in the last month. In May, there was some growth in the required yields for government borrowing, which was mainly the result of the improved macroprudential outlook in the euro area. The costs of borrowing in the private sector remain low. The cost of Slovenian borrowing on capital markets, together with other government bonds, increased, but nevertheless remains low: for ten-year maturity it increased from 0% to 0.16%, which is a yield comparable to that for Belgium and France.     The recovery of the euro-area economy from the pandemic is still in the early stage, and at the same time is still accompanied by high risks associated with the development of the epidemic and consequently macroeconomic trends. For this reason, the members of the Governing Council decided that for the third quarter we would maintain unchanged the scope of pandemic purchases of securities, i.e. at the raised levels of the second quarter. This scope of purchases will serve to additionally support the recovery, and will place it on more solid foundations, while at the same time ensuring a continuance of the favourable financing conditions, where we will also maintain all the necessary flexibility.

      "text":" Zgodovinski arhiv Celje \u2013 Hi\u0161a pisanih spominov     Glavni meni     Vsebina strani     Vsebina prispevka     Kralj Sigismund in kraljica Barbara ustanovita Red zmaja     8. 9. 2014     Kot dodaten vir in dopolnilo, ki nastaja ob razstavi \u201cABC Arhivska Barbara Celjska\u201d, objavljamo prevod listine o ustanovitvi Reda zmaja. Listino, ki jo hrani Mad\u017earski dr\u017eavni arhiv v Budimpe\u0161ti je s pri\u010dujo\u010do spletno objavo privi\u010d mogo\u010de prebrati v celoti v slovenskem jeziku, dodan pa je tudi prevod v angle\u0161ki jezik.     Razstava, ki nastaja v produkciji Zgodovinskega arhiva Celje in Pokrajinskega muzeja Celje ter katere avtor je dr. Aleksander \u017di\u017eek, bo predstavila 16 izbranih reprodukcij listin, ki jih hranijo: Mad\u017earski dr\u017eavni arhiv v Budimpe\u0161ti, Hrva\u0161ki dr\u017eavni arhiv v Zagrebu, Dr\u017eavni arhiv v Vara\u017edinu, Arhiv hrva\u0161ke akademije znanosti in umetnosti v Zagrebu ter Arhiv Republike Slovenije. Eden od glavnih ciljev razstave je vrniti v interpretacije zgodovine \u201cabecedo\u201d zgodovinopisja, predvsem povratek k obravnavi virov, ki so sodobni predmetu raziskave. Z vklju\u010devanjem novih in doslej zelo slabo poznanih arhivskih virov bi se radi ognili obravnave zgodovine na podlagi \u017ee ukoreninjenih mitolo\u0161kih izro\u010dil. Celjski, ob tem pa Barbara, so nazoren primer tega, kako so bili namesto primarnih virov v ospredju oblikovanja podob preteklosti vedno bolj mitolo\u0161ko pre\u017eeti literarni viri.     Kralj Sigismund in kraljica Barbara ustanovita Red zmaja*     Sigismund, po bo\u017eji milosti kralj Ogrske, Dalmacije, Hrva\u0161ke, \/\u2026\/ Galicije,Poljske, Kumanije in Bolgarije, mejni grof Brandenbur\u0161ki, glavni komornik Svetega rimskega cesarstva, dedi\u010d \u010ce\u0161ke in Luksemburga, in Barbara, kraljica omenjenih kraljestev, soproga gospoda kralja Sigismunda, izrekata vsem zvestim v Kristusu \u2013 sedanjim in prihodnjim, ki bodo to brali, pozdrav v Odre\u0161enikovem imenu. \/\u2026\/     Svoje srce in srca na\u0161ih zvestih spodbujamo k hvali, slavi in povzdigovanju imena na\u0161ega odre\u0161enika in zveli\u010darja Jezusa Kristusa, sina \u017eivega boga, ki je po sprejetju krhke \u010dlove\u0161ke telesnosti s svojim pre\u010dastitim trpljenjem posvetil zastavo \u017eivega kri\u017ea za re\u0161itev na\u0161e bede \u2013 tega najsvetej\u0161ega kri\u017ea, ki ga je \/\u2026\/ Jezus Kristus v uni\u010denje peklenskih okov ponesel po svojem vstajenju od mrtvih. Verujo\u010d v Boga in odre\u0161ilno bo\u017ejo pomo\u010d ter v s skrivnostjo obdan kri\u017e, je najslavnej\u0161i bo\u017eji bojevnik, blagoslovljeni mu\u010denik Jurij, premagal starega sovra\u017enika, ujetega zmaja, o\u010deta peklenskih zlob, ki je pri\u0161el k njemu \u2013 ranil ga je s kopjem in poteptal na zemljo. Presveta gospa in mu\u010denica Marjeta, ki so jo izro\u010dili Kristusovim sovra\u017enikom in jo je zmaj po\u017erl, je stopila iz njega nepo\u0161kodovana, ko so zmaja presekali podolgem, ker je verovala in slavila kri\u017e.     Skupaj s prelati, baroni in velika\u0161i na\u0161ega kraljestva, ki jih vodimo pri sodelovanju na tem zboru, v znamenje na\u0161ega \u010distega prizadevanja za pregon pogubnih naslednikov tega zahrbtnega sovra\u017enika in starega zmaja \u2013 namre\u010d poganskih vojska in razkolnikov drugih narodov, sovra\u017enikov prave vere, Kristusovega kri\u017ea in na\u0161ih kraljestev, mi in zvesti baroni na\u0161ega kraljestva izberemo, sprejmemo in se zavezujemo, da bomo javno nosili kot skupno enotno insignijo znak oziroma podobo zmaja, zvitega v krog, ki si ovija svoj rep okoli goltanca; njegov hrbet je podolgem razparan od glave do konca repa, v beli izkrvaveli rani pa nosi rde\u010di kri\u017e na belem polju, kakr\u0161nega obi\u010dajno nosijo in imajo tisti, ki se borijo pod zastavo sv. Jurija.     Podpisani na\u0161i baroni in velika\u0161i na\u0161ega kraljestva (so tisti), zvesti iz mladosti, \u010dasa na\u0161ega sre\u010dnega kronanja, s katerimi vladamo zaradi njihovih zrelih nasvetov, hrabrih dejanj in pomo\u010di, (tisti,) ki nam \u017eelijo ugajati in si iskreno prizadevajo ne samo v \u010dasu na\u0161ih tegob in porazov, ampak tudi pri pove\u010devanju na\u0161ih koristi \/\u2026\/, (tisti,) ki so se sr\u010dno borili proti na\u0161im sovra\u017enikom, tako v na\u0161ih kraljestvih kakor izven njih, (opravljali) zveste juna\u0161ke slu\u017ebe (in imajo) vidne zasluge v vseh delih na\u0161ega kraljestva, v vseh stiskah in uspe\u0161nih odpravah in dejanjih, kot tudi (tisti) ki so nam z nasvetom stali ob strani. Spodaj podpisane zveste barone na\u0161ega kraljestva, ter vse druge, ki nosijo omenjeni na\u0161 Red zmaja, sprejemamo in jim obljubljamo v na\u0161i dobri veri izkazovati \u010dast, veljavo ter jih povzdigovati, \u010disto in pravi\u010dno, kot se spodobi. Obljubljamo, da bomo odkrito ravnali z vdovami in sirotami teh, kiso po bo\u017eji volji od\u0161li s tega sveta, v premo\u017eenjskih in drugih pravicah in kakr\u0161nihkoli sporih, kakor da bi bile to na\u0161e lastne sirote in vdove. Obljubljamo, da jih bomo podpirali in varovali pred vsemi napadalci in temi, ki jih ho\u010dejo nadlegovati; kolikor je mogo\u010de bomo laj\u0161ali njihovo breme in jih varovali pred \u0161kodo, te\u017eavami in drugimi groze\u010dimi nevarnostmi.     \u010ce kdo izmed \u010dlanov tega reda iz kakr\u0161negakoli vzroka pade v nemilost na\u0161ega veli\u010danstva, takrat proti njemu ne bomo ravnali odlo\u010dno ali strastno, temve\u010d smo dol\u017eni to oznaniti zvestim baronom omenjenega reda. Na\u0161i baroni tega reda so dol\u017eni na\u0161emu veli\u010danstvu (zagotoviti) popolno podporo v sporu s \u010dlanom reda, mi pa s tem, kar baroni sklenejo, sogla\u0161amo in sprejmemo.     Mi, omenjena gospa kraljica Barbara, prav tako sprejemamo to listino v na\u0161i dobri veri, se ji zaobljubljamo in sprejemamo vse in vsako posebej, k \u010demur se je zavezal na\u0161 gospod kralj Sigismund, na\u0161 najdra\u017eji soprog, za vse ve\u010dne \u010dase s \u010disto mislijo, nedotaknjeno, ravnaje na podlagi nasvetov in usmeritve zvestih baronov.     Mi, despot \u0160tefan, gospod Srbije; Herman, grof Celjski in Zagorski, njegov sin grof Friderik, Nikola Gorjanski, ogrski palatin; Stibor s Stiboric, sicer sedmogra\u0161ki vojvoda; Jan, sin Henrika s Tamasija in Jakob Lack s Szanta \u2013 oba sedmogra\u0161ki vojvodi; Jan Maroti, ma\u010dvanski ban; Pipo z Ozora, severinski ban; Nikolaj s Se\u010de, dvorni to\u010daj; grof Karel Krbavski, najvi\u0161ji kraljevi zakladnik; Simon, sin bana Kona s Se\u010dijan, upravitelj jezov; grof Jan Krbavski, upravitelj kuhinje; Jan, sin Gregorja z Alsan, dvorni to\u010daj; Peter \u010cech z Levic, dvorni hlevar; Nikolaj \u010cak, sedmogra\u0161ki vojvoda; Pavel Besenyji,[1] Pavel Pecsi \u2013 oba pred tem bana Dalmacije, Hrva\u0161ke in Slavonije; Mihal, sin \u0160alamona z Nadasdyja (Sarvarja), \u017eupan kraljevskih Sikulov;[2] Peter s Perina, pred tem \u017eupan Sikulov, sedaj \u017eupan Marmaro\u0161ki; Emrih s Perina, tajni kraljevski kancler in Jan, sin gospoda Nikole Gorjanskega. Mi, baroni teh kraljestev, izvoljeni v to dru\u017ebo, zdravo razmi\u0161ljajo\u010d, kako dobronamerno in s \u010dastmi, resnostjo in prijaznostjo nas podpirata omenjeni gospod kralj Sigismund in gospa kraljica Barbara, zavedajo\u010d se tudi, da nosi na\u0161 gospod kralj na\u0161o zvesto slu\u017ebo ter slu\u017ebo na\u0161ih sorodnikov in prijateljev, povezano s prelivanjem krvi, shranjeno v svojem srcu. Nagradil nas je z mnogimi dobrinami, kraljevsko milostjo in doslej na podlagi ukazanih na\u0161ih slu\u017eb, kot se spodobi, povi\u0161al in ustregel na\u0161im potrebam. \/\u2026\/ Z iskreno zvestobo in enako voljo na isti na\u010din obljubljamo, da se brez hinav\u0161\u010dine in prevare obvezujemo ohranjati omenjenemu na\u0161emu gospodu in njegovi \u017eeni ter njunemu potomstvu obeh spolov, pravo poslu\u0161nost in stalno zvestobo, jim izkazovati zvesto slu\u017ebo in jih podpirati v vseh dobrih dejanjih. Gospo kraljico pa bomo \u2013 \u010de se zgodi, da ostane vdova po omenjenem na\u0161em gospodu kralju Sigismundu \u2013 bodisi s potomstvom ali brez, v vseh na\u0161ih gospostvih in posestvih varovali in branili iskreno po na\u0161ih mo\u017enostih. V dobri veri obljubljamo, da bomo v polni meri podpirali vse, kar bo prispevalo k pove\u010danju \u010dasti na\u0161e dru\u017ebe (reda), utrjevanju in ohranjanju njenega polo\u017eaja ter tega, kar bomo po\u010deli. Nadalje bomo gospoda kralja, gospo kraljico in njune potomce zvesto podpirali in branili, ohranjali tajnost tajnih posvetov, prav tako obljubljamo, da bomo baroni in cela na\u0161a dru\u017eba po svojih mo\u010deh v bo\u017ejo \u010dast ohranjali pravo in \u010disto bratstvo.     \u010ce bi se kdorkoli izmed nas \/\u2026\/ sprl z drugim (iz tega reda),[3] tedaj \/\u2026\/ moramo to oznaniti gospodu kralju in drugim baronom. Kar skupno odlo\u010dijo kralj in baroni, se mora spo\u0161tovati. \u010ce kdo mimo te dru\u017ebe (reda) z drugim za\u010dne z vojno, tedaj se naj kralj in baroni skupaj odlo\u010dijo, \u010de se mu[4] naj nudi podpora, nasvet ali voja\u0161ka pomo\u010d. Katerikoli na\u0161 \u010dlan, ki je v sporu, mora spo\u0161tovati na\u0161 dogovor, ki ga je sklenil s kraljem in nami.     \u010ce bomo lahko sprejemali kakr\u0161nekoli zakone, dobre in pravi\u010dne novosti v javno dobro, korist, razcvet in povzdigo omenjenih kraljestev, moramo to posku\u0161ati delati skupaj in z najve\u010djo skrbjo ter trudom. Mi, omenjeni kralj, vsem baronom na\u0161e dru\u017ebe obljubljamo, da nikoli ne bomo kak\u0161nega posveta, odlo\u010danja ali zborovanja, ki se ti\u010de na\u0161e dru\u017ebe, izvedli z manj kot 5 osebami.     Da bi lahko ta na\u0161a kraljestva pred pogani bolj\u0161e branili in varovali, se v dobri veri zavezujemo, da bomo sprejeli vse, kar bi lahko prispevalo k obrambi. Proti poganom \u017eelimo delovati z vsemi silami. Omenjeni baroni in cela dru\u017eba obljubljamo v dobri veri, da ho\u010demo z nasvetom in pomo\u010djo na\u0161ega gospoda kralja in njegovih naslednikov ter namestitvijo na\u0161ih ljudi, brez obotavljanja \u2013 vedno z veseljem in ustre\u017eljivo, skrbeti za obrambo, tako proti tem poganom kakor tudi proti drugim, ki bi hoteli \u0161kodovati na\u0161im kraljestvom. (To bomo storili) tako, da bomo na mesto, na katero bo kralj v obrambo teh kraljestev poslal kogarkoli iz te dru\u017ebe, poslali pomo\u010d in podporo, kar naj se zgodi po posvetu (dogovoru) kralja in baronov tega reda.     \u010ce bomo hoteli v ta red sprejeti visokorodne, pogumne gospode, bomo vedno imeli polno, svobodno pravico, da jih sprejmemo. \u010ce bomo koga sprejeli, ho\u010demo, da prihaja na posvete in ga bomo podpirali, varovali in branili v smislu teh pravil. Ko novosprejeti \u010dlan prise\u017ee, da bo popolnoma in nepreklicno spo\u0161toval vse in vsako posamezno dolo\u010dbo ter ohranjal in spo\u0161toval vse, kar sklenemo mi in baroni tega reda, mora tudi delovati na osnovi tega.     \u010ce po preteku leta \/\u2026\/ katerikoli izmed baronov umre, tedaj \/\u2026\/ smo dol\u017eni izvoliti za barona drugega iz reda in poskrbeti za baronstvo.[5] Ko kak baron iz tega reda umre, se ostali baroni po mo\u017enosti snidejo na pogrebu pokojnika. Kdorkoli ne pride ali zaradi ovir ne more priti, d\u00e1 za du\u0161ni mir umrlega za 30 ma\u0161. \u010cimhitreje mora za vsako ma\u0161o pla\u010dati po 4 velike denarje \/\u2026\/ kot izraz \u017ealosti pa mora en dan nositi \u017ealno obleko. Ko dan mine, naj da obleko revnemu bera\u010du. Ho\u010demo tudi, da vsak petek vsak \u010dlan reda nosi \u010drno obleko. Kdor tega ne stori, mora dati za 5 ma\u0161 v slavo petih Kristusovih ran za pla\u010dilo 4 denarjev za vsako ma\u0161o.     \u010ce kdo iz reda opisani znak zmaja kak dan pozabi nositi, mora dati za 5 ma\u0161, za vsako ma\u0161o pa mora pla\u010dati 4 denarje. \u010ce katerikoli \u010dlan iz slabosti, strahu ali v ujetni\u0161tvu tega znaka ne more nositi, za to ne bo kaznovan. \u010ce kdo znak izgubi, ne bo kaznovan zaradi neno\u0161enja, dokler si ga spet ne priskrbi.     Dolo\u010damo, naj tudi bodo\u010di ogrski kralji ob kronanju s kraljevsko krono prevzamejo in sprejmejo znak tega reda, in da ti kralji med kronanjem in prisego o spo\u0161tovanju zakonov ter de\u017eelnih obi\u010dajev, prise\u017eejo in v dobri veri obljubijo, da bodo ta red v vseh \u010dlenih ohranjali in utrjevali.     In mi, omenjeni kralj Sigismund, kraljica Barbara, baroni kraljestva in ves zbor omenjenega reda se zavezujemo, \/\u2026\/ obljubljamo in se pridru\u017eujemo temu v dobri veri, dotikajo\u010d se lesa zveli\u010davnega kri\u017ea, da bomo vse zgoraj omenjeno (dogovorjeno), \u010disto in brez prevar in zvija\u010d, nedotaknjeno ohranjali s to listino. V spomin tej zadevi in v ve\u010dno trdnost dajemo mi, kralj Sigismund in kraljica Barbara, z na\u0161im trdnim namenom \/\u2026\/ pe\u010datiti ta privilegij z avtenti\u010dnima obe\u0161enima pe\u010datoma in pe\u010dati na\u0161ih baronov tega reda. Dano z roko na\u0161ega \u010dastivrednega o\u010deta v Kristusu, na\u0161ega ljubega in zvestega gospoda Eberharda, varadinskega \u0161kofa, na\u0161ega najvi\u0161jega kanclerja, leta Gospodovega 1408, dan pred decembrskimi idami, v 20. letu na\u0161ega ogrskega kraljevanja.

Sigismund, by the mercy of God the King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia, \/\u2026\/, Galicia, Poland, Kumanija, and Bulgarian, Margrave of Brandenburg, Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Empire, heir to Bohemia and Luxembourg, and Barbara, the Queen of the said kingdoms, the spouse of his Lordship King Sigismund, extend to all loyal in Christ \u2013 present and future who are to read this, a salutation in the name of the Saviour. \/\u2026\/     We encourage our hear and the hearts of those loyal to us to praise, worship and exalt the name of our Saviour and the Redeemer Jesus Christ, the son of the living God, who after accepting the brittle human corporeality sanctified with his venerated suffering the banner of the living Cross for the salvation of our misery \u2013 the holiest of crosses that \/\u2026\/ Jesus Christ, to the destruction of the chains and fetters of hell, lifted and carried after his resurrection. With faith in God, in the redemptive grace of God, and in the Cross veiled in mystery, God\u2019s most famed warrior, the blessed martyr George, slew the old adversary, the captured dragon, the father of infernal malice, who came to him \u2013 he wounded him with his spear and trampled it into the ground. Our Lady and martyr Margaret, turned over to the enemies of the Christ and devoured by the dragon, emerged from him unharmed when the dragon\u2019s gut was slit open lengthwise, because she had believed in and worshipped the Cross.     Along with prelates, barons, and magnates of our Kingdom whom we lead in their participation at this assembly, as a sign of our pure quest to persecute the condemned successors of this treacherous enemy and old dragon \u2013 the pagan armies and schismatics of other nations, enemies of the true faith, the Cross of the Christ and our Kingdoms, we and faithful barons and magnates of our Kingdom shall bear and have, and do choose and agree to wear and bear, in the manner of society, the sign or effigy of the Dragon incurved into the form of a circle, its tail winding around its neck, divided through the middle of its back along its length from the top of its head right to the tip of its tail, with blood [forming] a red cross flowing out into the interior of the cleft by a white crack, untouched by blood, just as and in the same way that those who fight under the banner of the glorious martyr St George.[1]     The undersigned barons and magnates of our Kingdom (are they who are) faithful from our youth, the time of our fortunate and blessed coronation, with whom we rule for their sage advice, acts of valour and charity, (they) who wish to please us and who honestly endeavour not only during our misfortunes and defeats, but also in enhancing our benefits \/\u2026\/ (they) who fought courageously against our foes both within our kingdoms and beyond, (performed) loyal heroic service (and have) evident merit in all parts of our Kingdom, in all misfortunes and successful expeditions and acts, as well as (those) who have stood by our side with their advice. The undersigned faithful barons of our Kingdom and all others bearing our Order of the Dragon are embraced and to them we promise in our good faith to do the honour and exalt them, purely and justly, in due manner. We hereby vow to treat fairly the widows and orphans of those who leave this world by the mercy of God, with regard to any rights, property or otherwise, and any disputes, as if they were our own orphans and widows. We vow to support them and protect them from any invaders and those who look to molest them; we shall relieve them of their burdens to the best of our efforts and we shall protect them from harm, woes, and other imminent threats.     Should any member of this order fall into disgrace with our majesty, then we shall not act against him decisively or passionately, but we shall rather be obliged to announce such occurrence to the loyal barons of the said Order. Our barons of this Order shall (provide) to our Majesty full support in the dispute with the member of the Order and we shall agree with and accept what the barons decide.     I, the said Lady Queen Barbara, also accept this edict in good faith, vow to it and accept it, each and every one, to which our Lord King Sigismund, my beloved husband, has also vowed, always and evermore with pure thought, innocent, acting as advised and directed by our faithful barons.     I, despot Stefan, the Lord of Serbia; Herman, the Count of Celje and Zagorje; his son Count Friderik; Nicholas II Garay (Garai Mikl\u00f3s II), the Palatine of Hungary; Stibor of Stiboricz, the Voivode of Transylvania; John (Tam\u00e1si J\u00e1nos), son of Henry Tam\u00e1si, and James (Iacob) Lackovi\u0107 (Lack) of Sz\u00e1nt\u00f3 \u2013 both the Voivodes of Transylvania; John (J\u00e1nos) Morovi\u0107 (Mar\u00f3ti), Banus (Ban) of Ma\u010dva (Macs\u00f3); Pipo of Ozora, Ban of Syrmia (Sz\u00f6rv\u00e9ny); Nicholas (Mikl\u00f3s) Sz\u00e9chy, buttler\/steward; Count Charles (Karl) of Krbava (de Corbavia, Korb\u00e1viai), supreme treasurer; Simon Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9ny, guardian of the gates; Count john (Jan) of Krbava (Corbavia), master of the court; John Als\u00e1ni, son of George, cupbearer; Peter L\u00e9vai Cseh, equerry; Nicholas Cs\u00e1ki, Voivode of Transylvania; Paul of Bissen (Beseny\u0151)[2] and Paul de Pegh (P\u00e9csi), both former bans (viceroys) of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia; Nicholas N\u00e1dasdi, son of Solomon, prefect of the royal Sikuli (Szekleri, Szekelyi);[3] Peter of Per\u00e9nyi, previously the prefect of Sikuli, now the prefect of Marmaroc; Emeric of Per\u00e9nyi, secret counsellor; and John, son of Lord Nicholas Garay. We, the barons of these Kingdoms, elected into this company, sanely considering the benevolence and honour, solemnity and kindness that we are supported with by the Lord King Sigismund and the Lady Queen Barbara, also aware that our Lord King bears our loyal service and the service of our kin an friends, related to bloodshed, in his heart. He has rewarded us with many goods, royal grace, and to date based on the mandated services of ours, as it is becoming, promoted us and accommodated our needs. \/\u2026\/ With sincere loyalty and equal will in the same way we vow and commit without hypocrisy or treachery to maintain true obedience and permanent faithfulness to our Lord and his wife and their offspring of both genders, to provide our loyal service and to support them in all good acts. Should our Queen be widowed, with offspring or without, we shall protect and defend her honestly and as we best can, in all our dominions and estates. We vow in good faith to fully support all that will contribute to elevation of the honour of society (order), strengthening and maintaining its position and our endeavours. Furthermore, we shall faithfully support and defend our Lord King, our Lady Queen, and their offspring; we shall keep secret our secret deliberations; and we vow that we the barons and our entire society will, best we can, to the honour of God, maintain true and pure brotherhood.     Should any one of us \/\u2026\/ find himself in a dispute with another (of this order),[4] then \/\u2026\/ we shall announce such dispute to the Lord King and other barons. The decision of the King and the barons shall be honoured and complied with. Should anyone start a war with another without consulting this society (order), then the King and the barons shall jointly decide whether to support him,[5] by advice or military assistance. Any member of ours who is in dispute shall honour our agreement made with the King and with us.     If we are to adopt any laws, sound and just, novel, serving the public good, benefit, flourishing, and elevation of the said kingdoms, we shall seek to do so together and with utmost care and effort. I, the said King, vow to all barons of our society never to conduct any deliberation, decision-making or assembly regarding our society, without at least five persons present.     In order to be able to protect our kingdoms from the pagans and infidels, I commit in good faith to adopt anything that could contribute to defence. I wish to act against the pagans and infidels with all our force. The said barons and the entire society vow in good faith that we will, with advice and with support of our Lord King and his successors, and by deploying our men, without hesitation \u2013 always willingly and obligingly, provide defence against these pagans or infidels as well as against others who would set out to harm our kingdoms. (We shall do this) by sending support to the place to which the King may send any one from this society to defend these kingdoms, which shall take place following a consultation (agreement) between the king and the barons of this order.     If we wish to welcome noble high-born gentlemen into this order, we shall always have the full and free right to do so. If anyone is admitted, we shall request that he come to assemblies and we shall support him, protect and defend as laid down in these rules. When the newly accepted member vows to fully and irrevocably honour each and every provision hereof and to maintain and honour everything decided by the King and the barons of this order, he shall act accordingly.     If after a year \/\u2026\/ any of the barons should die, than \/\u2026\/ we shall appoint as baron another one from the order, and bestow upon him the title and estate of a baron.[6] When any of the barons of this order dies, the other barons, if possible, shall meet at the funeral of the deceased. Whoever does not attend or is unable to do so, shall donate 30 holy masses for the salvation of the soul of the deceased. As soon as possible, he shall pay four large guldens for each mass \/\u2026\/ as an expression of mourning, he shall wear a mourning garment for one day. After that day, he shall present the garment to a poor beggar. We also wish that every Friday each member of our order wear a black garment. Whoever fails to do so, shall donate five masses to worship the five wounds of Jesus Christ, paying four large guldens for each mass.     Should anyone of this order forget on any day to wear the sign of the dragon, he shall donate five holy masses, paying four large guldens for each mass. Should any member not be able to wear the sign due to illness, fear, or captivity, he shall not be punished. Should anyone lose the sign, he shall not be punished for not wearing it until he is provided a new one.     We also order that the future Kings of Hungary upon coronation with the Hungarian crown adopt and accept the sign of this order, and that these Kings during the coronation and oath of obedience of the laws and the customs of the lands also vow in good faith and promise to uphold and strengthen this order in all articles.     And we, the said King Sigismund and Queen Barbara, barons of the Kingdom, and the entire assembly of the said order, vow, \/\u2026\/ promise and join this in good faith, as we touch the wood of the Saving Cross, to maintain all of the above (agreed), purely and without deceit or treachery, intact with this charter. In memory and eternal solidity hereof, we, King Sigismund and Queen Barbara, with our solid intent \/\u2026\/ hereby seal this privilege with authentic pendant seals and the seals of our barons of this order. Conveyed by the hand of our honourable father in Christ, our beloved and faithful Lord Eberhardt, the Bishop of Varadin, our supreme chancellor, in the year of the Lord 1408, on this day before the Ides of December, in the 20th year of our Hungarian reign.

Sipronika participates in the project \"Safety Ambassador\", where our novel multi-colour speed displays have been installed in 13 Slovenian municipalities.     Initiated by the sponsorship of Goodyear Dunlop Sava Tires d.o.o. we designed and installed our multi-color speed displays MHP50 (RGB), which show different content based on measured or displayed speeds, respectively.     In the municipality of Sevnica one of such displays slows down the traffic in the close vicinity of a primary school. When the speed limit 30 km\/h is exceeded bold red colored words \"TOO FAST!\" are displayed and at speeds less than 30 blue and yellow \"THANK YOU!\" shows up.     Currently, the displays of the project \"Safety Ambassador\" are located in the municipalities \u0160en\u010dur and \u0160kofja Loka, but in the short term they will be placed also in the remaining ten Slovenian municipalities.

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     The Decisions adopted by the Governing Board on the occasion of its 312th regular meeting on 15 June 2005     06\/15\/2005 \/ Press release     Decisions adopted by the Governing Board on the occasion of its 312th regular meeting:     In its today\u00b4s 312th session, the Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia inter alia discussed monetary developments. The tolar exchange rate has gradually appreciated against the euro since the beginning of April. The average exchange rate amounted to 239.69 EUR\/SIT in the foreign exchange market in April and to 239.61 EUR\/SIT in May. It has been floating below the central parity since end-April, with the average deviation from this parity amounting to 0.01 per cent in May.     The Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia also adopted the Decision on Harmonising the Operation of the Slovene Export Company with the Regulation Which Regulates the Operation of Banks. In compliance with the Act on Hedging and Funding International Transactions of Economics, the Slovene Export Company must finally harmonise itself with the regulation which regulates the operation of banks no later than 31 December, 2006.

Ve\u0161 tista kapa, ki ti je tako zelo v\u0161e\u010d, pa je ne nosi\u0161, ker pika? Izvoli trik, kako lahko nadlogo re\u0161i\u0161 v enem popoldnevu!     O, ja. Volneni kosi so letos zelo zelo zelo modni, in \u010de \u017ee nima\u0161 polne omare puloverjev, potem ima\u0161 zagotovo v predalu vsaj eno kapo, ki je sicer topla, ampak, \u2026 ne hvala.     Razlog? Pani\u010dno praskanje po 5 minutah no\u0161enja, ker pa\u010d pika.     Da se ti to ne bo zgodilo, potrebuje\u0161 le en preprost trik, ki se ga bo\u0161 \u017eelela lotiti \u017ee to popoldne. Te zanima, kako si lahko pomaga\u0161? Izvoli!     V mrzlo vodo dodaj nekaj \u010dajnih \u017eli\u010dk kisa, vanjo pa poto\u010di narobe obrnjeno kapo (ali obla\u010dilo). Ko je kapa res prepojena z me\u0161anico, jo vzemi iz vode in delno osu\u0161i.     Ko je kapa le \u0161e vla\u017ena (in ne mokra), jo polo\u017ei na ravno povr\u0161ino, in vanjo vtri balzam za lase. Tako pripravljeno pusti stati pribli\u017eno pol ure, nato pa kapo reeeees dobro izperi s hladno vodo.     Ko je kapa dobro sprana, jo odlo\u017ei na brisa\u010do in pusti, da se posu\u0161i. Ko je dokon\u010dno posu\u0161ena, jo spravi v plasti\u010dno vre\u010dko za \u017eivila, in preko no\u010di postavi v hladilnik.

I am, The Other. Video ambient and performance     Wednesday, June 27, 2012 at 9 p. m. SCCA Project Room, Metelkova 6, Ljubljana     Video Turn analyses main formal and conceptual characteristics of video language through various working methods (analysis, curating, critical writing, interviews, collecting audiovisual works and documents, workshops, lectures, panel discussions, presentations).     Neven Korda will prepare for the Video Turn project a video ambient and performance questioning his artistic position within the video art.     From the promo text:     \"WHOxx, originates from a seemingly simple question What is video?, which the artist had posed to himself more than a decade ago.     With its multiplicity of transformations, video ambience WHOxx provokes, simulates and parodies contemporary identity, which seems to have an unlimited number of choices, while in fact it anticipates precisely determined modes of conduct, which is why breakdowns and errors in this uniform system appear not only as aesthetic but also political statements.     WHOxx treats space as a social political arena, which transposes to video not only to show the feedback and the endless loop of public activity, but also to give space to the specific aesthetics of the medium of video, which \u2013 like the identity of contemporary individuals \u2013 is integrated into the generative processes of constant repetition and reinterpretation of existing statements.\"     Photo: Miha Fras     Production: SCCA-Ljubljana Production of performance WHOxx \/ Confessionf of a Videast: Aksioma - Institute for Contemporary Art, Ljubljana (www.aksioma.org)     Neven Korda is a videast and a multimedia artist with a lasting artistic practice. He explores the issue of the essence of video as artistic expression and video as a medium. He speaks about the so-called pure video. He started using video in the early eighties, as a member of the theatre group FV 112\/15, when affordable video equipment became available at the market. He is co-founder of FV Video, the independent video production which has brought to fruition several artistic, music and documentary video projects. Until the end of the eighties, he was a member of the group Borghesia; he did the visuals for their performances and concerts and he directed their video clips. He was a member of the artistic tandem ZANK with Zemira Alajbegovi\u0107. In the nineties, he also worked as video editor, author of TV images, director and realiser of projects and TV shows. At the end of the millennium, he converted to research, practice and recording of pure video art     DIVA Station Physical and web archive of video art which is being developed with the intent to research, document, present and archive video\/media art.

Njegova du\u0161a gre v nebesa, kjer se pred vhodom sre\u010da s Sv. Petrom. \"Dobrodo\u0161el v nebesa!\" re\u010de Sv. Peter, \"Preden te nastanim, hm, zgleda, da imamo problem. Zelo poredko se znajdejo tukaj visoki relativno dobri funkcionarji tako, da ne vemo kaj bi s tabo.\" \"Ti .. samo spusti me noter. Ne bo problema.\" Se odre\u017ee politik. \"\u010ce bi smel, bi te spustil. Se pa moram dr\u017eat navodil od zgoraj. Predpis za take modele pa pravi, da mora\u0161 pre\u017eivet en dan v peklu, en dan v nebesih. Nato se bo\u0161 sam odlo\u010dil kje bo\u0161 pre\u017eivel ve\u010dnost.\" \"\u017de \u017ee, ampak jaz sem se odlo\u010dil, da bi \u0161el v nebesa.\" \"\u017dal, predpisi so predpisi .. najprej si oglej situacijo, potem se pa odlo\u010di.\"     In sv. Peter ga pospremi do dvigala, s katerim se \u010dlan parlamenta spusti dol .. dol in dol do pekla.     Vrata se odprejo in poslanec se znajde sredi lepo negovanega golf igri\u0161\u010da. Nedale\u010d stran so klubski prostori, pred njimi pa veliko njegovih prijateljev in drugih politikov, ki so v\u010dasih skupaj delali. Vsi so razposajeni in veseli, lepo oble\u010deni v ve\u010dernih oblekah. Pritekli so mu nasproti, ga pozdravili in obujali so spomine na lepe \u010dase, ki so jih skupaj pre\u017eiveli in bogateli na ra\u010dun davkopla\u010devalcev. Odigrali so prijateljsko tekmo golfa, nato se pa gostili z jastogom in kaviarjem ter pili \u0161ampanjec. Z njimi se je zabaval tudi sam Lucifer, zelo prijeten, prijazen in ve\u010dno mlad fant, plesal, pripovedoval sme\u0161nice .... Zabava je minila in pri\u0161el je \u010das odhoda nazaj k sv. Petru. Veselo slovo ...     Dvigalo se dviga in dviga. Ustavi se pred nebe\u0161kimi vrati, kjer ga \u017ee \u010daka sv. Peter.     \"Zdaj pa je \u010das, da obi\u0161\u010de\u0161 Nebesa.\"     Poslanec prebije naslednjih 24 ur v skupini veselih du\u0161, premikajo se iz oblaka na oblak, igrajo na harfo in prepevajo, opazujejo \u017eivlejnje na Zemlji, komentirajo, angelci se spreletavajo med njimi, jim stre\u017eejo pija\u010do, hrano .... Imajo se super, tako, da tudi teh 24ur mine prehitro.     In spet se ex-parlamentarec znajde pred sv. Petrom.     \"Dobro, prebil si en dan v peklu in en dan v nebesih. Zdaj pa izberi svojo ve\u010dnost.\" re\u010de Peter. Poslanec malo pomisli, nato odgovori: \"Saj, res prej ne bi nikdar tako rekel. Nebesa so res \u010dudovita, toda, mislim da mi bo bolje v peklu.\" \"Kakor \u017eeli\u0161 .. ve\u010dno pomni - sam si izbral.\"     Sv. Peter ga zatem pospremi do dvigala, ki ga po\u0161lje dol, dol, dol in dol, do pekla. Vrata dvigala se odprejo in on se znajde sredi temno sive, zapu\u0161\u010dene pokrajine polne raznih odpadkov in smeti. Tu pa tam gori ogenj, na katerem se cverjo najhuj\u0161i zlo\u010dinci. Kriki trpljenja se razlegajo in re\u017eejo u\u0161esa, \u010drni oblaki prekrivajo nebo od obzorja do obzorja. Med to umazanijo vidi vse svoje prijatelje, kako v \u010drne vre\u010de nabirajo odpadke, brodijo po ogabni, sluzavi umazaniji do kolen, odrivajo o\u017egane, mu\u010dene od bole\u010din vre\u0161\u010de\u010de du\u0161e ..     Lucifer se mu pridru\u017ei in ga objame \u010dez ramena. \"Ne rrrazummmem ...\" zajeclja ex-poslanec s solzami v o\u010deh \" .. v\u010deraj sem bil tu, tukaj je bilo golf igri\u0161\u010de in klubska hi\u0161a, gostili smo se z jastogom in kaviarjem ter pili \u0161ampanjec, plesali in se na polno zabavali. Zdaj pa je tu pu\u0161\u010dava polna odpadkov, umazanije, groza, po\u0161asti .. moji prijatelji so pa postali \u010drne, obupane sence samih sebe. Zakaj? Kaj se je zgodilo?\" Lucifer ga pogleda izpod \u010dela in s hudobnim nasme\u0161kom razlo\u017ei:     \"Predv\u010deraj\u0161njim smo imeli predvolilno zborovanje, danes si pa volil.\" ___________ ps.: Tako zdaj veste zakaj sem z volitvami opravil za vedno.     idiotizem naroda (!!) = prena\u0161anje vsega tega in dovoljevanje manipulacij. Lopovi so (za sebe) precej pametni in zlorabljajo umsko nedozorel narod. To je tako kot \u010de skrbnik zlorablja umsko zaostalo mladenko. Menda se zdaj razumemo?     Idiotizem je tudi zanimanje za javne zadeve, ki so velikokrat le maska za uveljavitev lastnih, zasebnih interesov. Pardon, najve\u010dkrat! Odmev na #1     Hvala za mnenje. Ampak dokler narod pristaja na to, da \u017eivi v strankokraciji in ne zna vzpostaviti demokracije ... sem mnenja, da enostavno ni sposoben dovolj aktivnega interesa za skupno dobro.     Jure s temi VOLi je tako kot z besedo LOVE v sLOVEniji. Volivci so voli samo v slovenskem jeziku in slovenija je edina dr\u017eava v kateri je ljubezen, samo v angle\u0161kem jeziku. Tako, da se moram strinjati z Brankom. Mic po Mic in bodo spremembe. Rim so gradili 2000 let in ga \u0161e vedno.     Kdor se ne zanima za javne zadeve je IDIOT. Beseda IDIOT izhaja iz stare gr\u010dije. Idiot is a word derived from the Greek \u1f30\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, idi\u014dt\u0113s (\"person lacking professional skill\", \"a private citizen\", \"individual\"), from \u1f34\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, idios (\"private\", \"one's own\").[1] In ancient Greece, people who were not capable of engaging in the public sphere were considered \"idiotes\", in contrast to the public citizen, or \"polites https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Idiot     An idiot, dolt, dullard or (archaically) mome is a person perceived to be lacking intelligence, or someone who acts in a     Oglasi     hager werken embalming powder +27640518120 (pink and white) compound\/fluids for sale in south africa hager werken embalming compounds, pink and white powder are general items from germany. embalming is the art and science of preserving human remains by treating them in its modern form with chemicals to forestall decomposition. the intention is to keep them suitable for public display at a funeral,for religious reasons, or for medical and scientific purposes such as their use as anatomical specimens. embalming compound in powder form both pink and white radio active and (hot and not hot) its all available. at preferably adorable prices starting from one kilogram upwards ,we are looking for a good buyer. typically embalming compound (fluid) contains a mixture of formaldehyde, methanol, and other solvents. the formaldehyde content generally ranges from 50 to 97 percent and the methanol content may range from 9 to 89 percent.the types of embalming powder depends on the purity and colour. purity:98% ,100% hot compound origin:germany brand. hager werken purity on colour. pink 98% white 100% distributor dentist \/ dental technician. hager & werken products are sold through the dental trade worldwide. we are leading suppliers of germany made embalming compound to clients in south africa and other african states. . contact: +27640518120 or watsup.     @europe universal ssd chemical solution+27660432483 in uk,norway,egypt, turkey, libya, thailand, belgium, spain, netherlands, brazil, switzerland we have ssd automatic chemical solution for cleaning black money and any color of defaced currency available in our laboratories worldwide. our ssd automatic solution is also used in the cleaning of bank notes with anti-breeze quality, bills like usd, euros, pounds and other local currencies. we are direct manufacturer and the main supplier of chemicals that includes ssd solution, super automatic solution. we have different types of chemicals that can perfectly clean out your notes, black notes, red notes, green notes, stained notes, stamped notes and also coded notes. we also melt frozen chemicals in our laboratory and our services are professional. we therefore provide legal document for all our products. contact us for more information:     @universal suppliers of ssd chemical solution +27660432483 in south africa, protea glen , chiawelo , protea north , mthatha nelspruit newcastle pietermaritzburg pinetown polokwane port elizabeth potchefstroom pretoria randburg roodepoort rustenburg sebokeng soshanguve e, harare, namibia, windhoek, botswana to purchase best ssd solution clean black notes dollars we also?

Museum of Contemporary Art, Lotty Rosenfeld, Martina Ruhsam & Vlado Repnik, \u0160kart, Endre T\u00f3t, Goran Trbuljak, \u017delimir \u017dilnik, a selection of videos from the EVR Archive, and the Museum in the Streets archive     Starting on Friday, 18 January 2013, our exhibition The Present and Presence is on view with a new twist: Repetition 3 - The Street. Works have been added or brought into focus in two rooms on the first floor and on the ground floor of the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova, where you will also find Dan Perjovschi's poster. The film by Nu\u0161a and Sre\u010do Dragan is screened at the Moderna galerija, Cankarjeva 15. The works comprising the Repetition 3 - The Street selection are marked with Dan Perjovschi's stamp.     The exhibition The Present and Presence: Repetition 3 - The Street again focuses on lived time, this time limiting the presentation to the works made in public space - more specifically, in the streets. Included in this new display of works largely from the Moderna galerija national collection and the Arteast 2000+ collection is the archive of the project Museum in the Streets, organized by Moderna galerija in 2008, during the renovation of our main museum building, when no funding was allotted for the exhibitions program.     The reason Repetition 3 is so focused on art in the streets is quite plain. Over the last two years, the streets have, once again, become our other physical body, not only in Slovenia, but all over the world: a physical space where we breathe the same air as the others, where we are relearning to shout, where we write our own placards and pick out favorites among those written by others. After we had, it seemed, teetered on the brink of losing the streets and the squares, when we seemed to have moved into virtual worlds, the physical world has again started to recoup its value. The good old streets are accessible to the poor and the rich alike, to the old and the young, to those on Facebook and those without profiles. Everyone can bring their body, their voice, their thought, and their anger to the streets and the squares; and it works like group therapy, where every gesture, at least momentarily, seems to be effective and to serve some common goal. We have almost forgotten how important it is to express ourselves, and express ourselves with our entire bodies. We are relearning participation, endurance, and repetition. With every demonstration it is becoming increasingly clear that what we are seeing happening in the streets in Slovenia is not merely a revolt against the politics of austerity measures and cuts in public funding, most acutely felt in education, healthcare, and culture. The people in the streets are rebelling against neoliberal autocrats and corrupt(ed) powers that be, and merging into a forum demanding the preservation of the fundamental basis of the democratic state: the rule of law and equality in access to education, healthcare, and culture for all.     During the time of socialist rule, the public manifestations carried out in the streets by the artists from Eastern Europe, whose works are kept in our Arteast 2000+ collection, were gestures for democracy. When three members of the OHO Group draped themselves in black fabric in 1968, to enact, with their bodies unified into one with their three heads sticking out, the three-headed Mt Triglav, a symbol of Slovenia, their act presented a disruption in the gray everyday socialist life in Ljubljana. Tomislav Gotovac protested against the lack of freedom by streaking through the streets of Belgrade, and Milan Kn\u00ed\u017e\u00e1k by inviting passersby to join him in his demonstration by crowing. Endre T\u00f3t staged demonstrations carrying placards with zeros written on them. At a recent demonstration in Ljubljana, the group Irwin carried placards with the circular scheme of the Coca-Cola bottle top and a slogan taken from a campaign for the same beverage: Time for a New State. While T\u00f3t's zeros stood, decades ago, for empty ideological speech, the Coca-Cola bottle-top circles speak of the invisible power of multinational capital. In another totalitarian regime, Lotty Rosenfeld used white tape to make large white crosses in the streets; her performance carried great symbolic weight and meaning under Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. The Chto Delat? platform organized a visualization of a Brecht poem in St. Petersburg in 2005; the poem was displayed by \"engaged\" sandwich people on the same spot where the Russian Revolution had begun 100 years earlier. During the time of the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime in Serbia, the \u0160kart collective carried out the notorious street action Your Shit - Your Responsibility, and Vlado Repnik and Martina Ruhsam organized the Blank_Protest in 2008, a demonstration without any demands or slogans, representing an \"anomaly in the dictionary of political jargon\".     The Present and Presence: Repetition 3 - The Street also includes the archive of the Museum in the Streets show from 2008. During the renovation of the Moderna galerija's main (and then only) building, the Ministry of Culture did not provide a venue or funding for our public program. For this reason we decided to organize the Museum in the Streets project, to draw attention to our situation: the central national institution for modern and contemporary art was closed for three years and would have remained virtually without program if not for such near-protest projects. That (unsupported) situation has again repeated itself over the past two years since our Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova opened. We now have twice the exhibition space to work in, but not a single additional employee, while our program funds have been reduced to less than the total we were allotted while working in just a single building. The history of street art helps us develop our potential of free creativity under conditions in which art and culture are losing the support and protection that would (otherwise) enable them to carry out their vital public mission.

Answerable for a cultural heritage we researched, responsible for a local history we documented what otherwise would be probably gone with the wind. You are looking at the part of project, which handles 12 villages of the Gotschee Germans. It marks them with signs and puts them on a map. The villages are furthermore presented by movies at www.KocevarskeVasi.si.From the middle of the 14th century until 1942, a German- speaking area of approximately 800 sq km in size was part of the Ko\u010devsko region. During the Nazi occupation, Germans living in various European countries were massively migrated back to the German Reich by the Nazi government. After the Italians had occupied the Ko\u010devsko region in 1941, a small German-speaking community of about 12,000 people had to migrate as well. The Gottscheer Germans were appointed the area along the Sava and the Sotla rivers in the Lower \u0160tajersko region, from which the most Slovenians had been exiled. After WW2, the destiny of the Gottscheer Germans was similar to that of other German-speaking communities in Slovenia. Those who did not leave with the German army at the end of the war and those few who remained in the Ko\u010devsko region were exiled to Austria by the new Yugoslav government. Later, they dispersed and settled in various parts of Austria and Germany; many moved to the Unites States of America.     The exile of the Gottscheer Germans, post-war devastation and decay, and well-planned destruction of mostly sacral buildings in the 1950s had a fatal long-term effect on the area. More than one half of 176 villages in the Ko\u010devsko region were destroyed: the area is now covered with woods. Only 28 out of 123 churches have been preserved, and out of approximately 400 chapels and religious signs about 40 can still be found. Many cemeteries were either levelled with the ground or the German tombstones were removed. Apart from the changes in the national structure, the economic and proprietorial situation of the area was profoundly changed. The Karstic soil and the densely wooded area of the Ko\u010devski Rog with its deep abysses witnessed mass killings of several thousands of Slovenian soldiers opposing the National Front, who were returned to Slovenia after they had tried to emigrate. The extensive region was later closed to the public and a number of penal and work camps were set up. Very few remnants are left to this day to witness the 600-year- long presence of the German national community amidst the Slovenian territory. The plaques present the images of the once vibrant villages, countryside and its people, who shaped the Ko\u010devsko region over the centuries. Author: dr. Mitja Ferenc     O projektu \"Izgubljene ko\u010devarske vasi\"     1     2     Krokar je znan pod imenom Ravenski pragozd ali Borov\u0161ka gora. To je v Sloveniji najve\u010dji pragozdni gozdni kompleks, kjer so z gospodarskim izkori\u0161\u010danjem prenehali leta 1885. Pozneje je bilo samo nekaj manj\u0161ih posegov v gozd - zadnji pred petdesetimi leti. Rezervat ima 76,96 ha povr\u0161in. Krempa je gozdni rezervat, rasti\u0161\u010de narcis (Narcisus poeticus) in razgledi\u0161\u010de. Obsega 4,6 ha.     Ime naselja verjetno izhaja iz besede Einlauf, kar pomeni zatrep doline, ukanc, zatok. Naselje je bilo v znanih zgodovinskih virih prvi\u010d omenjeno kot Hinlaff v urbarju urada Ko\u010devska Reka leta 1498. Takrat je obsegalo \u0161tiri cela zemlji\u0161\u010da. Leta 1574 je imel Innlauf le dve celi in \u0161tiri polovi\u010dna zemlji\u0161\u010da s sedmimi posestniki ali desetimi doma\u010dijami, na katerih je \u017eivelo 35\u201340 oseb. Inlauf je v srednjem veku imel celo \u017eupana. \u017dupani so skrbeli za pravo\u010dasne in redne dajatve posestnikov svojega obmo\u010dja. Kmetje iz Inlaufa in naselij, ki so sodila v urad Ko\u010devska Reka, so morali denarne dajatve pla\u010dati nekaj dni po sv. Martinu, sredi novembra.     Inlauf je bil tip kolonizacijske obcestne vasi. Ve\u010dina hi\u0161 je bila obrnjena k cesti z vzdol\u017eno stranjo, kar je na Ko\u010devskem redka oblika. V prvi polovici 19. stoletja je naselje imelo 13 hi\u0161nih \u0161tevilk. Med leti 1880 in 1921 je bilo \u0161tevilo prebivalcev v vasi pribli\u017eno enako: od 68 do 80 ljudi. Po letu 1880 se je \u0161tevilo Slovencev v vasi gibalo od 10 do 22. Prebivalci so se pre\u017eivljali s kmetijstvom, ve\u010dinoma pa z delom v gozdu. Ve\u010dji upad prebivalstva so zabele\u017eili leta 1931, med zadnjim uradnim popisom prebivalstva v Kraljevini Jugoslaviji. V 13 hi\u0161ah je \u017eivelo 63 prebivalcev, kar je petina manj kot deset let prej.     Kraj je bil od srede 19. stoletja del ob\u010dine Borovec, od leta 1933 pa ob\u010dine Ko\u010devska Reka, oddaljene 8 km. \u017dupnija in \u0161ola sta bili v Borovcu, oddaljenem slab kilometer.     Pred II. svetovno vojno so bile \u017ee poru\u0161ene \u0161tiri od 18 o\u0161tevil\u010denih hi\u0161. V kraju je med zadnjim popisom pred selitvijo Ko\u010devarjev, 31. julija 1941, v petih hi\u0161ah \u017eivelo 17 Slovencev. V okviru \u0161turma Borovec je 25. in 26. novembra 1941 vas zapustilo 49 Nemcev iz devetih hi\u0161. Skica vasi, ki jo je naredila italijanska vojska spomladi leta 1943, ka\u017ee naselje kot uni\u010deno. Naseljena naj bi bila le ena hi\u0161a. Ob koncu vojne so v vasi na\u0161teli 27 oseb. V za\u010detku 50-ih let prej\u0161njega stoletja je naselje postalo del zaprtega obmo\u010dja Ko\u010devska Reka. Stalnih prebivalcev pa ni imelo ve\u010d. Inlauf je bil leta 1953 priklju\u010den Borovcu. Preostale zidove opu\u0161\u010denih kamnitih hi\u0161 so uporabili za gradbeni material.     V za\u010detku leta 1952 je bilo na travniku na ju\u017enem robu naselja urejeno mo\u0161ko kazensko tabori\u0161\u010de. Postavili so dve ve\u010dji leseni baraki za kaznjence, barako za paznike in kuhinjo. Tabori\u0161\u010de so ogradili z bode\u010do \u017eico, ograjo in stra\u017enimi stolpi. Za en stra\u017eni stolp so uporabili steno zvon\u010dnice kapele. Leta 1955 so tabori\u0161\u010de ukinili in odstranili vse objekte. Inlauf je ostal del zaprtega obmo\u010dja Ko\u010devska Reka vse do demokrati\u010dnih sprememb leta 1990. Leta 2013 so naseljene in skrbno vzdr\u017eevane tri hi\u0161e. Ob njih so hlevi in pa\u0161niki za govedo. Urejena je pe\u0161pot na Krempo in ve\u010d informacijskih tabel.     V vasi je bil ob koncu 19. stoletja rojen veterinar dr. Hans Ganslmayer, profesor za bakteriologijo in serumsko terapijo. Njegove metode zdravljenja \u017eivine so kasneje prilagodili tudi za zdravljenje ljudi.     Ta zgradba je stala ob kolovozu proti Gornji Brigi, okoli 120 m jugovzhodno od vasi. Podobna je bila ve\u010dini starej\u0161ih podru\u017eni\u010dnih cerkva. Spadala je v \u017eupnijo Borovec. Zvon\u010dnica je bila na zahodni strani, nad vhodom. Pravokoten tloris ladje je prehajal v peterostrani prezbiterij. Streha je bila prekrita s skodlami. Cerkvica je bila zgrajena najkasneje sredi 18. stoletja. Gotovo ni bila prva kapela v vasi, saj naselje ni moglo \u017eiveti brez sakralnega objekta kar dve stoletji. Na zunanj\u0161\u010dini je bila letnica 1808, o\u010ditno datacija ene izmed prenov. Kasnej\u0161a predelava je nekoliko pove\u010dala vhod in vsaj okno na severni strani. V cerkvi je bil en sam oltar. V zvoniku sta nekdaj visela dva zvona (1799 in 1849, oba ulita v ljubljanski zvonarni Samassa). Pod odprtinama za zvonove je bila ni\u0161a s kipom. Podobne ni\u0161e je bilo mogo\u010de zaslediti na ve\u010d drugih zvon\u010dnicah Ko\u010devske. Glede na ustni vir, kapela ni bila po\u0161kodovana med vojno. Podrli so jo skupaj s tabori\u0161\u010dem leta 1955. Vidnih ostankov kapele ni ve\u010d. Kam je izginila oprema, prav tako ni znano. Lipa, ki je rasla ob kapeli, pa \u0161e zeleni.

TONiC\u2122 downloads     Data sheets     Renishaw\u2019s TONiC\u2122 series represents a new generation of super-compact encoders, designed for highly-dynamic precision motion systems, bringing higher accuracy, speed and greater reliability to a wide variety of demanding industry sectors.     Renishaw\u2019s TONiC FS (Functional Safety) is an open optical encoder system certified to the following international safety standards: ISO 13849 Category 3 PLd, IEC 61508 SIL2, IEC 61800\u20115\u20112 SIL2. TONiC FS offers all the benefits of the established TONiC linear and angle encoder systems giving exceptional metrology performance and ultimate reliability.     TONiC UHV encoder offers all the benefits of the established TONiC linear and angle encoder systems, in a readhead that has been designed and constructed using Ultra-High Vacuum compatible materials and processes.     DSi brings higher accuracy to rotary axes whilst propoZ\u2122 technology offers a selectable reference mark position.     RTLC linear encoder tape scale from Renishaw combines \u00b15 \u03bcm\/m accuracy with the ruggedness of stainless steel. Two versions are available; self-adhesive RTLC-S and RTLC for use with the revolutionary FASTRACK track system from Renishaw.     RKLC is a robust, 6 mm wide stainless steel encoder tape scale with a thickness of 0.15 mm. This allows the scale, when rigidly fixed to a machine axis, to become \u2018mastered\u2019 to the machine substrate, matching its thermal expansion coefficient and behaviour. Differential movement between the scale and the machine is thus minimised, improving the metrological performance that can be achieved with simple thermal system compensation.     Measuring a partial arc of rotation is made easy with Renishaw\u2019s flexible RKL encoder scales. The flexible nature of the small cross-sectional area of these scales allows them to be wrapped around a drum, shaft or arc with a minimum radius of 26 mm. RKL scale is compatible with Renishaw\u2019s QUANTiC\u2122, VIONiC\u2122, TONiC\u2122, ATOM DX\u2122, ATOM\u2122 and RESOLUTE\u2122 readheads providing a partial arc solution for a wide range of applications.     RELM20 ZeroMet\u2122 scale is manufactured from near zero thermal expansion material, ensuring the high level of accuracy is maintained across the full temperature range.     Renishaw\u2019s patented RGSZ20 20 \u03bcm gold scale features customer selectable optical IN-TRAC reference marks. Uniquely these are directly embedded into the incremental channel to enable electronic auto-phasing simply by pressing a button.

TONiC systems are quick and simple to install with wide set-up tolerances and calibration at the push of a button. TONiC's dynamic signal processing gives improved signal stability with ultra-low Sub-Divisional Error, high running speeds and compatibility with linear and rotary applications. This makes TONiC suitable for the highest of performance applications where speed and accuracy are crucial. TONiC UHV is available for ultra-high vacuum applications.     Case studies     Beijing U-Precision Tech Co., Ltd. (U-Precision) is a leading manufacturer of equipment for high-precision industrial processes. Its advanced semiconductor equipment and motion stages use Renishaw's high-performance TONiC optical encoder systems.     Vacuum technology is used in many high-precision manufacturing processes. Typical applications include semiconductor wafer inspection, wafer bonding, photolithography and thin film deposition. VAD selected Renishaw's TONiC UHV encoder and RLE fibre optic laser encoder for its latest range of vacuum compatible platforms, which deliver improved motion control performance.     Thorlabs designs and manufactures a wide array of photonics equipment: it selected the TONiC series to equip both the Thorlabs DDS600 600 mm long travel stage and the MLS203 microscope stage, as the Renishaw encoders outperformed the competition in every test and have enabled to deliver high-performance motion control products that customers can depend upon.     A continuous product development cycle, horizontal organisational structure and streamlined range of model sizes have made COORD-3 a global CMM brand. Renishaw supplies a wide-range of precision metrology products to COORD-3 and both companies benefit from a long-standing and successful partnership.     ASM Pacific Technology Ltd (ASMPT), the world\u2019s largest supplier of wafer assembly and packaging equipment for the semiconductor industry, aims to offer complete factory automation solutions and satisfy customers\u2019 needs through its innovative and cost-effective products.     Motion system designers usually face a compromise between speed and accuracy, yet Steinmeyer-FMD\u2019s new precision, multi-axis air bearing gantry system overcomes this dilemma with the help of Renishaw\u2019s high-performance TONiC\u2122 optical incremental encoder.     How fuel efficient is a commercial airliner? The honeycomb seal-ring has been proven to optimise the fuel efficiency of aero-engines, but the measurement of these seals present difficult engineering challenges. Now, HAESL has solved this challenge by incorporating Renishaw\u2019s TONiC incremental linear and rotary (angle) encoders within its new optical Seal Ring Measurement System (SRMS).     Known for its nano-motion stages for biomedical, semiconductor and photovoltaic applications, ALIO Industries depends on Renishaw encoders for the accuracy and repeatability needed to drive its True Nano\u2122 motion system solutions.     The digital age has led to a quantum leap in astrophotography, making even the furthest galaxies accessible to professional astronomers and observatories. Now, thanks to Astrosysteme Austria (ASA), helped by Renishaw technologies, even keen amateurs can observe and photograph these remote solar systems at an affordable price. "

      "text":" Route Description     How many of you have heard of the Grme\u010dica Waterfall? This beautiful Slovenian pearl is hidden well in the embrace of nature and it blew us away. Slovenia is indeed a country of a thousand waterfalls.     The waterfall is officially 8 meters (26 feet) high, but if we add all its levels, it is altogether 19 meters (62 feet) high. It is located on the stream of the same name, which descends steeply from the Jelovica Plateau towards the Sava Bohinjka River. The picturesque waterfall has a big water flow and is quite loud under normal hydrological conditions.     The access is by road that goes from Bled to Bohinj. The starting point of the route is just before the village of Bohinjska Bistrica, near the village of Nomenj, where the bus station, railway station and the Gostilna pri Mati\u010dku Inn are located. However, there are no marked parking spaces. The 20-minute walk takes you through the underpass under the railway line, where you look for the signs that say \u201cGrme\u010dica\u201d and \u201cEmin plav\u017e\u201d. After crossing a footbridge, turn right. A few steps back is a turnoff to the left up the hill, where you can access the upper waterfalls.     Interesting Facts     The Devil\u2019s Bridge in Stara Fu\u017eina is a significant technological achievement, built in the second half of the 18th century by Baron \u017diga Zois. The bridge crossing the Mostnica River was a challenging construction undertaking. It was built in a single arch of hewn stone and placed over the deep gorge. There is a legend of how the bridge got its name that you can read in the following paragraphs.     An old legend says that the people of Bohinj built a bridge before nightfall, but by the morning, it was completely destroyed. They concluded that the Devil himself should build the bridge. In exchange for the service, the Devil demanded the first soul that crossed it. One peasant had a dog and when the bridge was finished he threw a bone to the other side, and his dog leapt after it. Thus, the Devil received the soul of a dog. In his anger, he thrashed his tail about bringing down the fence but the bridge still stands.

      "text":" Center for Contemporary Arts     V-F-X Ljubljana Programme     Luka Prin\u010di\u010d: trans.fail     Duration: 45\u2032 Free tickets     This hybrid AV solo performance utilises pre-recorded and real-time live audio-visual elements and texts to create a frantic and chaotic mesh of data, images and noise. It sources data from various media channels and transfigures them: online videos, home-made software, sonic explorations and visual algorithms, hacks, glitchings and a number of thematic focuses, such as the Slavic-Romani mythical futurism, gender fluidity, imperialism, media theories, praxis and the artistic critique of digital capitalism. The performance premiered online; this is the first time that it will be performed before a live audience.     Luka Prin\u010di\u010d is a musician, performer and intermedia artist, who has worked in the field of computer and electronic music, sound art, intermedia installations and performance art for years, focusing on diverse approaches to creative processes and their manifestation in artistic events and works.     Production: Emanat     Wednesdy, 7 July, 21.00     sixpackfilm Presents: Body Games     Art & Revolution was the name of the action that ended up becoming one of the most famous happenings of the Austrian post-war period. G\u00fcnter Brus, Otto M\u00fchl and Peter Weibel were summoned to court. Otmar Bauer was also present that day. His famous action known as Vomit-Action remains one of the most radical works of Viennese Actionism. Birth of Venus by Moucle Blackout is more relaxed, but no less offensive. Stiffness 1-3\/7 is a long-term serial conceptual project about masturbation. Mara Mattuschka is one of the most outstanding representatives of Austrian avant-garde filmmaking. Her films are well-known for their extreme high- and low-angle shots and shifts in perspective with which she modulates the appearance of the filmed bodies and faces. In Couples, Maria Lassnig combines animation techniques and real image to depict bodies that do not always wish to fit into one another. Cmelka, in turn, rubs cream on her body, affected by neurodermatitis, in a film in which the artist\u2019s very skin fuses with the skin of the film strip. In Prince of Peace, against the backdrop of tolling church bells and a staccato editing, Hans Scheugl\u2019s camera follows several men as they enter a public toilet that, at the time, was a well-known gay cruising place. For Ashley Hans Scheirl, super 8 has been one of their favourite artistic tools since the very beginning of their filmmaking career; the films they made in collaboration with Ursula P\u00fcrrer show a strong commitment to the queercore and punk movements. This hedonistic subculture is particularly present in Summer of 1995, which captures the drag king fever that was raging in London at the time.     The programme will be introduced by Jonida La\u00e7i.     Art & Revolution (Kunst & Revolution) Ernst Schmidt jr., Austria, 1968, 16 mm, 1.33, 2\u2032, 2\u2032, silent ______________ Actions by G\u00fcnter Brus, Otto Muehl, Peter Weibel, Franz Kaltenb\u00f6ck, Otmar Bauer, Herbert Stumpfl, Anastas, Oswald Wiener, and an unidentified masochist. Experimental documentary film about one of the most famous happenings by the Viennese Actionists, which includes real footage from the event. Having scandalized the Austrian society and government, the happening led to multiple attacks by the press and ended up with Otto Muehl and G\u00fcnter Brus summoned to court. Oswald Wiener was forced to flee the country.     Otmar Bauer Shows (Otmar Bauer zeigt) Otmar Bauer, Austria, 1969, digital (shot on 16 mm), 7\u2032, silent ______________ One of the most radical works of Viennese Actionism \u2013a performance during which Bauer drinks, vomits, eats, urinates, and wallows in his own effluents, without showing the slightest consideration for himself or the audience.     Birth of Venus (Die Geburt der Venus) Moucle Blackout, Austria, 1970\u20131972, 35 mm, 1.37, 5\u2032 ______________ To three songs by The Beatles and in free association with the eponymous Botticelli figure, Blackout combines symmetric cuts of pigs (using a mirror effect) with portraits of different people and pictures of dancing women.     STIFFNESS 1-3\/7 (STEIFHEIT 1-3\/7) Albert Sackl, Austria, 2018, 35 mm, 1.37, 9\u2032, silent ______________ A serial conceptual long-term project about masturbation. Every ten years, Sackl sits in front of his 16mm camera and tries to keep an erection for around four hours. The resulting footage is then compressed into a 3-minute film through time lapse and single image recording. To this date, 3 of the 7 episodes that Sackl plans to create have been completed. The project, which may, at first glance, look banal and chauvinistic turns out to be a humorous self-deconstruction that incidentally happens to offer an overview of the history of pornography through the lens of its reception by the viewers.     Nabel Fabel Mara Mattuschka, Austria, 1985, 16 mm, 1.33, 4\u2032 ______________ Mara Mattuschka is one of the most outstanding representatives of Austrian avant-garde filmmaking who had already caused a stir with her alter ego Mimi Minus. \u201cIn Navel Fable she subjects herself to a second birth through endless pairs of tights. Her body struggles so hard and in such a deformed manner from out of the layers of nylon that the sheer struggle for survival becomes visible.\u201d \u2013 Peter Tscherkassky     Neurodermitis Kerstin Cmelka, Austria, Germany, 1998, 16 mm, 1.37, 3\u2032, silent ______________ Cmelka rubs cream on her body affected by neurodermatitis in a film in which the artist\u2019s very skin fuses with the skin of the film strip.     Couples Maria Lassnig, Austria, USA, 1972, 16 mm, 1.37, 10\u2032 ______________ Lassnig combines animation techniques and real image to depict bodies that don\u2019t always wish to fit into one another. This footage is paired with short and repetitive but hilarious episodes that portray a failing love affair.     Super-8 Girl Games Ursula P\u00fcrrer, Ashley Hans Scheirl, Austria, 1985, digital (shot on 16 mm), 1.37, 2\u2032 ______________ The film radiates an incredible freshness of intimacy and vitality. The filmmakers characterised the series of films that Super-8 Girl Games belong to as \u201chome movies\u201d.     Prince of Peace Hans Scheugl, Austria, 1993, 16 mm, 1.37, 6\u2032 ______________ With a backdrop of tolling church bells and a staccato editing, Hans Scheugl\u2019s camera follows several men as they enter a public toilet that was, at the time, a well-known cruising place for gay men. The footage is intermingled with inserts of fragmented pictures from a porn magazine in which the portrayed model wears a Jesus tattoo on his upper arm. The film is dedicated to a friend who \u2013 as the year of production suggests \u2013 died of AIDS.     S.O.S Extraterrestria Mara Mattuschka, Germany, Austria, 1993, 16 mm, 1.33, 10\u2032 ______________ The world as a playground for a giantess from outer space. A Godzilla imitation on the way to herself: the giantess from outer space in the streets of a big city, fooling around, producing destruction, copulating with the Eiffel Tower.     Summer of 95 Jason Elvis Parker, Ashley Hans Scheirl, Austria, 1995, 16 mm, 1.33, 13\u2032 ______________ For Ashley Hans Scheirl, whose works with Jakob Lena Knebl have been selected to be featured at the Austrian Pavilion for the Venice Biennale 2021, super 8 has been one of his favorite artistic tools since the very beginning of his filmmaking career. The films he made in collaboration with Ursula P\u00fcrrer in the 80s show a strong commitment with the queercore and punk movements. His work materializes positive sexual energies that denounce the bourgeois judgmental and moralist perspectives while celebrating sexual pluralism.     Thank you, I have been very pleased (Danke, es hat mich sehr gefreut) Mara Mattuschka, Austria, 1987, 16 mm, 1.33, 2\u2032 ______________ A nude Mimi Minus engages in autoerotic activity while the camera distances itself, in leaps and bounds, to the point that Mimi\u00b4s white figure is tiny and eventually disappears in a glaring, high-contrast mountain landscape.     sixpackfilm was founded in 1990 as a non-profit organisation. The task undertaken by sixpackfilm is to secure an audience for Austrian film and video art, both inside Austria and abroad. Their current catalogue encompasses over 1,900 titles, including the historical classics of the Austrian film avant-garde.     Thanks to Austrian Cultural Forum Ljubljana for help in organising the programme.     Thursday, 8 July, 16.00     Round Table: Space and Time to Experiment     Duration: 90\u2019 Free tickets In English     At the round table discussion, we will talk about the circumstances in which experimental film and video works are forged, made and shown. The participants will present their experiences, thoughts and initiatives. The discussion between An\u017ee Per\u0161in (Stenar Projects, Lisbon), Greg de Cuir Jr. (Alternative Film\/Video, Belgrade) and Sa\u0161o Sedla\u010dek (Academy of Fine Arts and Design, Ljubljana) will be moderated by Varja Mo\u010dnik (Slovenian Cinematheque).     Thursday, 8 July, 19.00     Curated Programme Stenar Projects: A Support Structure Through Its Catalogue     An Emotional Sherpa by the Norwegian artist Trygve Luktvasslimo was Stenar Projects\u2019 first production and is the first film in this curated programme, an examination of a support structure and its catalogue. Sunstone by Filipa Cesar and Louis Henderson was the first project that Stenar Projects received film funding for. Contemporary art funding often does not cover the total cost of a moving-image project, so access to the majority of film funds requires festival distribution. That is why, in addition to funding and production, Stenar Projects also took up festival distribution. The third film in the programme is I gave my love a cherry that had no stone by the British artist Emily Wardill. Emily defines her piece as a sculpture. It is usually installed on a big heavily tilted screen and runs as a loop. This is the first time she has apprehensively agreed to show it in a cinema. It is on this point of discomfort and ambition between how we exhibit, how we produce and how we finance that Stenar has been meeting its artists for the last six years.     The programme will be introduced by An\u017ee Per\u0161in.     An Emotional Sherpa Trygve Luktvasslimo, Norway, Portugal, 2015, DCP, 2.35, 22\u2019 ______________ The film tracks Fresnel lenses from their site of production to their exhibition in a museum of lighthouses and navigational devices. It also examines the diverse social contexts in which optics are implicated, contrasting the system of triangular trade that followed the first European arrivals in the \u2018New World\u2019 with the political potential seen in Op art in post-revolutionary Cuba. Incorporating 16mm celluloid images, digital desktop captures and 3D CGI, the film also maps a technological trajectory: from historical methods of optical navigation to new algorithms of locating, from singular projection to multi-perspective satellite visions.     Sunstone Filipa C\u00e9sar, Louis Henderson, Portugal, 2018, DCP (shot on 16 mm), 16:9, 34\u2019 ______________ The film tracks Fresnel lenses from their site of production to their exhibition in a museum of lighthouses and navigational devices. It also examines the diverse social contexts in which optics are implicated, contrasting the system of triangular trade that followed the first European arrivals in the \u2018New World\u2019 with the political potential seen in Op art in post-revolutionary Cuba. Incorporating 16mm celluloid images, digital desktop captures and 3D CGI, the film also maps a technological trajectory: from historical methods of optical navigation to new algorithms of locating, from singular projection to multi-perspective satellite visions.     I gave my love a cherry that had no stone Emily Wardill, Portugal, 2016, DCP, 16:9, 9\u2019 ______________ Holding in her mind Dorothea Tanning\u2019s painting Some Roses and their Phantoms (1952) and its sickening presentation of objects as between states of being, Wardill made a film that also hovers between definitions. The architecture of the Gulbenkian auditorium in Lisbon, its colours and sense of being lost in time accompany us through a loop where a man wanders the building at night, followed by something that is not human. Through the care and paranoia with which she approaches the digital image, the artist investigates the haunting of the present by the past and the remnants of textures longing to be touched.     Stenar Projects is a production platform that focuses on the artists\u2019 moving image and supports novel film practices through development, funding, production and distribution. Ranging between various genres and formats, its projects include an experimental feature documentary, a speculative short film, a digital animation and a micro-film, among others. Working closely with its collaborating artists, Stenar Projects has been producing new works for major art institutions and exhibiting films at international film festivals.     An\u017ee Per\u0161in has 18 years of experience in film. He had worked on commercial film production throughout Southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and owned a commercial production company in Lisbon. Since 2015, he has been developing Stenar Projects, a production platform for the artists\u2019 moving image, based in Portugal. An\u017ee is a member of Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Produtores de Cinema e Audiovisual in Portugal and a 2019 Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program Grantee.     Thursday, 8 July, 21.00     Selection from the DIVA Station Archive: An Escape into Experiment     From a TV signal to video, from film stock to computer generated images. Te selection of works from the DIVA Station archive is a collage of different aesthetic and substantive approaches that reflect the time of their making and the technical limitations of a particular medium. All works share the creation of their own interspace of interpretation within the classically defined bearers of messages (words, images, sound, music\u2026).     The programme will be presented by Peter Cerov\u0161ek and Vesna Bukovec.     Space 2 Miha Vipotnik, Slovenia (Yu), 1986, digital (shot on U-matic), 4:3, 1\u2019 52\u201d \u00bb video ______________ In this video, Vipotnik makes an ironic statement about the state of Slovenian video production at the time and its (non-)inclusion in the TV programme. At first, the artist is sitting in a studio like a TV presenter, but then his statement continues as a voice-over accompanying a montage of segments from his older black-and-white video entitled Space, which were subjected to chroma keying. The video was broadcast as part of Avtovizija (1986), the first programme on auteur video on RTV Ljubljana.     Tereza Zemira Alajbegovi\u0107, Slovenia (Yu), 1983, 4:3, digital (shot on VHS), 4\u2019 24\u201d \u00bb video ______________ A collage of the manifestations of socialist victories and funerals, melodramatic films and family TV shows accompanied by the singing of Tereza Kesovija, the star of Yugoslav pop culture. A society ruled by old men and socialist populism; public and intimate life intertwine, connected in a dull and stuffy rhythm of passing time.     Three Doors Gorazd Krnc, Slovenia, 2007, digital, 4:3, 3\u2019 11\u201d \u00bb video ______________ The video collage is accompanied by the narration and dialogues borrowed from Barbarella (Roger Vadim, 1968). Using a green screen, the scenes cut out from the film are applied to the background composed of collaged shots covered by various filters during the editing. With this process, the film\u2019s galactic content is transferred into the real world and the metaphor of three doors on which Barbarella is based obtains a realer context.     Here and Now Neven Korda, Slovenia, 2007, digital, 4:3, 8\u2019 50\u201d \u00bb video ______________ The visualised and dubbed biography of Neven Korda is composed of a number of films from the New New Films (NNF) series. The film begins with the entire Gagarin and the narrator of 1 Sec of My Life. The sound and picture of Reincarnation on Taxidermist Monitor, Angelic Wreath on Speed and Angelic Wreath on Ocean are mixed. The artist characterised the work as a post (re-)use of finished works in the mode of editing on a timeline.     Computering_preview Sara Bezov\u0161ek, Slovenia, 2019, HD, 2\u2019 \u00bb video ______________ The video is a collage of clips from all 13 videos that were presented on their own media at Computering, an exhibition at Kino \u0160i\u0161ka\u2019s gallery. In the mash-up video technique, which has spread extensively with the phenomenon of mass image sharing on the internet, it focuses on the shots that include a computer. In addition to the experience of contemporary visual culture, the work also offers the starting points for the questioning of the role of the author and cultural appropriation in the contemporary world.     Memory Machine Kristina Kokalj, Slovenia, 2018, digital, 4:3, 4\u2019 25\u201d \u00bb video ______________ The video is a collage of black-and-white images shot on 35mm analogue film. The images follow one another at a rapid pace and, according to the principle of stop-motion animation, create the illusion of flickering and hectic movement. The images of nature (treetops, branches) and urban landscape (street lights, graffiti, fences, roads) are intertwined. Open aperture shots produce a branch-like linear light drawing that transitions and flashes alternately with close-ups of bare branches. The stroboscopic flashes of images are accompanied by Klemen Tehovnik\u2019s original music and emphasise temporariness, fragmentation and anxiety.     Videographics 19 Borut Savski, Slovenia, 2007, 4:3, 4\u2019 23\u201d \u00bb video ______________ Videographics are modern experimental narratives in which the image acts as a sound marker. Images are abstract and the connection between video and audio is direct, even though it does not follow any logic. A video graphics is a materialisation of an audio signal and an integral part of the experimental context.     Liquid Solidity Ur\u0161ula Berlot, Sun\u010dana Kulji\u0161 Gaillot, Slovenia, 2017, HD, 5\u2019 6\u201d \u00bb video ______________ This digital animation is based on the idea of simulating life at the molecular level. It shows a round shape in the process of constant transformation. A structure that alternately resembles the composition of viruses, complex proteins and carbon fullerenes is being decomposed, transformed and re-shaped in a string of ordering processes. The soundtrack was made by Scanner (Robin Rimbaud).     NO.4 (SONAR) Agnes Momirski, Slovenia, 2017, HD, 3\u2019 33\u201d \u00bb video ______________ A music video for Sontag Shogun no.4 (Sonar) from the Patterns For Resonant Space LP. In collaboration with Brencha (Brina Vidic \u2013 costume design).     Nightmares of the New World Nata\u0161a Prosenc Stearns, USA, 2017, HD, 7\u2019 31\u201d \u00bb video ______________ A series of three single-channel videos: Humans Crossing, Deafening Whispers\/Alternative Facts, Nucleus Brass. The world is being ruined by overpopulation, the deafening processes of destruction and people\u2019s outrageous audacity.     Sky In Ruins (di sotto in s\u00f9) Sa\u0161o Sedla\u010dek, Slovenia, 2016, HD, 3\u2019 40\u201d ______________ This dystopian visual illusion that alludes to the tradition of Renaissance ceiling painting opens a window into the nearby cosmos, where, in the blackness of the orbits along which satellites circle the Earth, there is far more space trash than satellites. Despite its vastness, the universe is not so unlimited that humans could simply continue spreading their bad earthly habits out into space without any ecological consequences. The 3D animation was made with the open source software Blender. The video installation was presented at the 8th Triennial of Contemporary Art \u2013 U3, at the Museum of Modern Art Ljubljana.     Galapagos Damjan Kracina, Vladimir Leben, Slovenia, 2005, 4:3, 5\u2019 39\u201d \u00bb video ______________ The video was created for a joint eponymous exhibition project by both artists. The close-ups of an installation of the Galapagos Islands with a volcano are followed by motifs of individual animal species from the paintings of Vladimir Leben. The video includes a clip from the video Ape Boys, which is followed by shots of the sculptures and drawings of fictitious animal species created by Damijan Kracina. The artists share an examination of issues related to animals, their rights and characteristics, and a good sense of humour and the absurd.     Postaja DIVA is a online and physical archive that the Centre for Contemporary Arts SCCA-Ljubljana has been developing since 2005 in order to research, document, archive and present art films, videos and new media art.     Friday, 9 July, 19.00     deskt0p_cinema     Compiled by: Greg de Cuir Jr. Duration: 70\u2032 Free tickets     This programme takes the form of a projector performance or, better yet, an interface performance, in which the platform is both an artistic tool and a canvas: the desktop display. The desktop as material, as editing suite, as camera, as projection mechanism \u2013 as perhaps the most consequential surface that touches countless people every day across the globe. Practiced by visual artists to challenge conventional forms of expression, used by academics to present and perform new modes of research, by film critics to engage with their objects of contemplation, and by legions of nonprofessionals who distribute all types of user-generated content online. Desktop cinema deletes divisions of high and low, commercial and non, film and video. It is the lingua franca of the 21st century. This projection performance will take a short journey through the various aesthetic and technological contours of the art of the desktop.     Programme will be performed by Greg de Cuir Jr.     Greg de Cuir Jr. is the selector of the Alternative Film\/Video festival in Belgrade. As an independent curator, he has prepared several video and film programmes at various international institutions. He is the editor-in-chief of NECSUS: European Journal of Media Studies and the book series Eastern European Screen Cultures. He writes specialist texts for magazines and publications. He obtained his PhD from the Faculty of Dramatic Arts, University of Arts in Belgrade.     Friday, 9 July, 21.00     Retrospective: Ema Kugler     People made of flesh and blood are captured in the mythic matrices of civilisation or the stifling laws of society that they themselves write. The tight (but also astonishing and practically palpable) frameworks can be transcended only by experiment that equals progress and destruction that creates a space for something new.     This programme is the beginning of the retrospective of Ema Kugler\u2019s films, which will take place in autumn at the Slovenian Cinematheque.     The programme will be presented by Ema Kugler.     The Visitior Ema Kugler, Slovenia, 1995, DCP (shot on Beta SP \u2013 digital mastering), 4:3, 27\u2019 \u00bb video ______________ The artist insists on the duality of human nature: the same dreadfulness is part of both the mythical and the real world. The duality is explicitly presented by means of electronic effects that can petrify a human face, or wall-up a human body in a few seconds. Human figures dressed in extravagant costumes are returned back to nature by means of electronic effects: a man in a costume reminiscent of a bird transforms into a real bird. The costumed and real birds are accentuated by the bird\u2019s eye view, which always emphasises man\u2019s smallness and forlornness in his own world and within nature.     Taiga Ema Kugler, Slovenia, 1996, DCP (shot on Beta SP \u2013 digital mastering), 4:3, 8\u2019 \u00bb video ______________ Video Taiga is made after eponymous performance carried out at the international festival of contemporary arts City of women in October 1995 in Ljubljana. Taiga is a dark video landscape with human figures in menacing costumes, but it also includes two almost naked fighters and a drowning woman. Wax dogs add to the coldness of the video taiga; they actually melt away, while the electronic effect only serves to accelerate the process. The essence of taiga is the act of destruction, or transition. The destruction of art form creates a new, entirely different pattern. The transition becomes an event with a message. Sculptures are the landmarks of the beginning and of the end.     Menhir Ema Kugler, Slovenia, 1999, DCP (shot on Beta SP \u2013 digital mastering), 4:3, 35\u2019 \u00bb video ______________ Urbanity is finally erased with mythological rituals, which is defined by the title of the video film: menhir, a large upright standing stone from the Neolithic Period which was used in sacred rituals. A man and a woman are Adam and Eve who are formed before us with electronic transformation (morphing) and are marked by blood, which also marks all the other elements of the video image: murder of an individual committed by a menhir or the trinity (politics, church, army), bodies of dancers. Blood, murder and death are only beaten by the second basic element: stone which is in the next moment drenched in blood. Electronic tricks, which turn rulers from flesh and blood into stone and vice versa, also act in the battle between natural elements.     Ema Kugler is a film director, producer and multidisciplinary artist with a distinctly unique authorial poetics. Since the 1990s, she has created a series of performances, films, installations and auteur videos that are a product of complex narratives, perfected scripts and original costume and set designs. She has received numerous Slovenian and international awards and prizes.

      "text":" Pehota velja za najpomembnej\u0161i rod vojske. Tako je bilo tudi v preteklosti. \u010ceprav je pehota izgubila na vrednosti v razli\u010dnih obdobjih, noben rod vojske ni mogel izpeljati naloge brez prisostvovanja pehote. Ta naloga se posve\u010da razvoju pehotne taktike skozi zgodovino. Pregledala bo rimsko vojsko, Prvo in Drugo svetovno vojno, nastanek teritorialne obrambe, in dana\u0161nji vojni v Iraku in Afganistanu. V teh zgodovinskih primerih bo poiskala zakaj se je pehotna taktika spreminjala in kako. Predpostavka je, da se je taktika spreminjala zaradi notranjih razmer v dr\u017eavi, zunanjih dejavnikov in zaradi tehnologije. Te tri dejavnike bo posku\u0161ala povezati s spremembo taktike v prej omenjenih obdobjih. Nato bo posku\u0161ala ugotoviti podobnosti v smernicah razvoja pehotne taktike. V zadnjem delu pa bo z analizo sedanjih in prihodnjih razmer posku\u0161ala ugotoviti trende razvoja v prihodnosti in s tem tudi povezati kak\u0161no usposabljanje bi morala imeti pehota v slovenski vojski, da bi bila v teku s \u010dasom.

The same wastrue in the past although it varied during different eras. The fact is that no branch of the military was able to complete their task without the infantry. This paper will devote itself to learning how infantry changed it stactics through history. The study will encompas the Roman military, World Wars I and II, the establishment of the teritorial defense as well as the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will try and understand why did infantry tactics change and how. Sthe assumption is that infantry tactics changed due to the domestic state of a country, foreign influences and technology. It wil try and conenct the three with the change in tactics in the before mentioned eras. Then it will try to find out the similarities in the developement in tactics during the different eras. In the last part it will analyze current and future situations and will try to discover the most likely course of evolution of tactics. It will then suggest what kind of training should the infantry in Slovenia have. "

The most important part of IBS Newsletter is publishing of reviewed scientific, research, professional and popular articles that discuss themes like international business, sustainable development, organization, law, environmental economics and politics, marketing, research methods, management, corporate social responsibility and other topics.     IBS International Business School Ljubljana     All authors who would like to contribute to IBS Newsletter are invited to send their contributions to info@ibs.si.     Letnik 9, \u0161t. 4     Namen \u010dlanka je spodbuditi profesorje vi\u0161jih in visokih \u0161ol, da prevetrijo svoje delo z vidika formativnega spremljanja pouka, druga\u010de re\u010deno, z vidika procesa za izbolj\u0161anje u\u010denja in pou\u010devanja, kar je najpreprostej\u0161a definicija formativnega spremljanja pouka. Zanj je zna\u010dilno, da v sredi\u0161\u010du u\u010dnega procesa ni profesor, ampak \u0161tudent, ki dobi nadzor nad celotnim u\u010denjem, in to od na\u010drtovanja ciljev, postavljanja meril in zbiranja dokazov o znanju do orodij za samoevalvacijo. Posebej pomembno je takoj\u0161nje prejemanje povratnih informacij v obliki nasvetov, ki spodbujajo vi\u0161je kognitivne procese, kreativnost in kriti\u010dno mi\u0161ljenje; cilj tega pa je izbolj\u0161ati znanje.     Klju\u010dne besede: formativno spremljanje, u\u010dni proces, visoka \u0161ola, povratna informacija.     Abstract     The purpose of the article is to encourage high school and university professors to bring a breath of fresh air to their work from the perspective of formative teaching, in other words, the process of improving learning and teaching, which is the simplest definition of formative teaching. It is characterized by the fact that, at the heart of the learning process, it is not the professor but the student who gains control over all learning: from planning goals, setting criteria and gathering evidence of knowledge to self-evaluation tools. It is particularly important for the student to receive immediate feedback in the form of advice that encourages higher cognitive processes, creativity and critical thinking; the aim is to improve knowledge.     Keywords: formative monitoring, learning process, high school, feedback.     Povzetek Prispevek razpravlja o problemih, ki zavirajo razvoj na \u0161tudente osredoto\u010denega u\u010denja in poziva \u0161tudente, naj uporabijo razpolo\u017eljive mehanizme, s pomo\u010djo katerih bodo pospe\u0161ili uvajanje u\u010dnih metod, ocenjevanja in organizacijskih elementov, ki jim bodo olaj\u0161ali \u0161tudij in ga naredili bolj zanimivega. Na \u0161tudente osredoto\u010deno u\u010denje zavira prepri\u010danje, da so stare u\u010dne metode in ocenjevanje \u0161e vedno najbolj\u0161e, da se dolo\u010denih splo\u0161nih na\u010del ne sme spreminjati, da so \u0161tudenti s slabimi ocenami leni, da se ne uvaja novih u\u010dnih metod, \u010de\u0161 da so preve\u010d rizi\u010dne (npr. u\u010denje na daljavo) itd. \u0160tudenti imajo danes vsaj formalno gledano pomembno vlogo pri odlo\u010danju na \u0161olah. Seveda jim manjka poznavanje u\u010dnih metod, ocenjevanja in organizacijskih vidikov u\u010denja, osredoto\u010denega na \u0161tudente. Vendar pa imajo mo\u017enosti, da preberejo, kaj pomeni na \u0161tudente osredoto\u010deno u\u010denje in da kot mo\u010dna, mlada skupnost na \u0161olah predlagajo, da se ga za\u010dne uvajati.     Klju\u010dne besede: na \u0161tudente osredoto\u010deno u\u010denje, ovire pri uvajanju, \u0161tudenti     Abstract The paper discusses problems that hinder development of student-centred learning and invites students to use available mechanisms with which they will accelerate introduction of teaching methods, methods of assessment and organizational elements that will facilitate their study and make it more interesting. Student-centred learning is hindered by opinions that old teaching methods and assessment are still the best, that certain general principles should not be changed, that students with poor marks are lazy, that some new teaching methods should not be introduced because they are too risky (e.g. distance studies) etc. Students have nowadays at least formally an important role in decision-making. Of course they lack knowledge about teaching methods, assessment and organisational aspects of student-centred education. However, students have the possibility to read about the meaning of the student-centred learning and that they \u2013 as a young strong part of an educational institution - demand that student-centred learning should be introduced.     Key words: student-centred learning, obstacles that hinder its development, students\u2019 voice     Tema \u010dustvena inteligenca se nana\u0161a na sposobnost prepoznavanja in obvladovanja lastnih \u010dustev ter tudi \u010dustev drugih. Glede na dejstvo, da \u010dustvena inteligenca ni nov izraz, je bil namen \u010dlanka raziskati poznavanje in razumevanje \u010dustvene inteligence. Raziskava vsebuje teoreti\u010dni del, kjer so zajete osnove teorije in predpostavke psihologov in raziskovalcev \u010dustvene inteligence, povezava s \u010dustvi ter prepoznavanje, upo\u0161tevanje \u010dustvene inteligence vrste inteligenc in \u010dustvena inteligenca v vodstvu.     The topic is emotional intelligence, which refers to the ability to recognise and manage our own emotions, as well as the emotions of other people. Given the fact that the emotional intelligence is not a new topic, the purpose of this research is to explore knowledge and understanding of emotional intelligence. The research consists of a theoretical part that covers the basics of emotional intelligence, its relation to emotions, together with recognition and consideration of the emotional intelligence in the name of psychologists and other scientists.     Key words: Emotional intelligence, emotions, intelligence, Q, IQ, SQ, EQ, employees, work place, management "

      "text":" The Pasice gorge and its waterfalls     The Pasice gorge in the village of Dolenji Novaki was created by the \u010cerin\u0161\u010dica torrent, which cut its river bed into the Njiv\u010d hill and eventually split it into two parts: Veliki Njiv\u010d (915 m) and Mali Njiv\u010d (758 m). On its path it chiseled many pools, waterfalls, and potholes. These characteristic karstic phenomena appear within the limestone as bedrock. The terrain is practically impassable without aids. Deep in the gorge is the location of Franja Partisan Hospital, to which a maintained steep path with small wooden bridges leads. Despite fragile rock walls, which are also very crumbly, the path to Franja Partisan Hospital is protected with appropriate safety measures.     There is a group of waterfalls in the gorge consisting of three consecutive waterfalls: the lower, the middle, and the upper waterfall.     In September 2007 the Cerkno region was hit by heavy rain, during which the water in the Pasice gorge demonstrated all of its destructive power. Large amounts of timber, rocks, and debris accumulated in the gorge, while the Franja Partisan Hospital and its original exhibits were swept away by water. After the flood a complete reconstruction of the hospital and regulation of the stream were undertaken, and the access paths for the visitors were also renovated.     The consequences of the devastating flood have been repaired, but the displaced rock by the path, on which there is still a broken remnant of the cemented memorial plaque, testifies to its severity.

      "text":" \u010crna gora     Orjen     Orjen is a limestone mountain massif north-west from the Bay of Kotor (Morinjski zaliv, Tivatski zaliv, Hercegnovski zaliv). The western most area of Orjen is in Bosnia and Herzegovina, other area of this mountain range is in Montenegro. Features of Orjen are glacial and karst relief with the magnificent vegetation as munikas - local pine trees. The highest peak of Orjen is Zuba\u010dki kabao (1894 m). This area with Crkvice is with the most precipitation in Europe (over 5000 mm per year). Orien Mountain was a borderline between Austrian and Otoman Empire. Fortresses and excellent constructed military roads built by Austrian army are forgotten historic heritage of this area.     The blog from September 2007:     Climate changes and talking about the present dramatic and the unusual weather behavior are \"in\" and popular debate, but only 8.000 - 10.000 years ago the climate changes were much more dramatic. Huge glaciers were covering Northern and the Central Europe, Alps were under the ice. The landscape has changed dramatically. Nowadays glaciers are only a pale picture of the past. Only a decade ago Slovenia had three small glaciers in the Alps (which were only modest miniatures of the huge Ice Age glaciers): Triglavski ledenik, Ledenik pod Skuto and Ledenik pod Prisankom. Today there are only gravel and moraines which indicates that there were glaciers.     Thousand kilometers southern in the Southern Balkan, glaciers of the Dinaric Mountains most probably disappeared in the time period of the end of the last Ice Age. Exceedingly interesting area was Orjen massif, which is situated on the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina, precisely Republika Srbska and Montenegro above the Bay of Kotor. The mountain range of Orjen is geologically from the s limestone of the Cretaceous period. The whole area is with the evident glaciokarst. The process of the karst is very distinctive but the former glaciers left evident landscape with U-shaped valleys and cirques. This area is with the precipitation of over 4000 mm up to 6000 mm and even more, which is among the highest in Europe so the expectation was that the process of the karst was very fast and intensive.     But where were the edges of the glaciers? Where was the lowest point? Was there a connection with the Bay of Kotor? How glaciers behaved on the karst and what was the influence of the ice to the karst processes? Those were some questions which lead Slovenian geomorphologists and climate researchers and their students to study this area in the summer 2007.     The base of the study was the detailed research of the ground navigating over the old Austrian military roads which are surprising still appliable for the transport even not renewed after the 150 years, and hiking over the wilderness. The part of the terrain research and the study has taken the place over the late spring with the final conclusions in the beginning of the September 2007.     The summer 2007 was extraordinary - the extreme lack of water so we had decided to carry the needed base potable water supplies from Slovenia. The group was divided into three teams of 6-7 persons, each team with the specific task and the area of the interest. The area was remote with no electricity so the only technical tools were GPS-s and classic maps, no notebooks with digital maps and GIS-s software tools. However... my tool, beside GPS was digital camera with the fisheye lens which I used to map the geomorphological landmarks of the area of Orjen and present them with the VR-panoramas.     Base camps of the expedition were in the territories of Republika Srbska (BiH) and Montenegro on the altitude of 1200 m up to 1800 m which was quite high as the sea was only few kilometers away. The highest peak of Orien is Zuba\u010dki kabao (1894). As the summer was dry there were constant burning forests and the bush. The result of the fire was a dim landscape which is evident on the displayed panos. Once we were even fire-fighters...     The evidences of the former glaciers were different moranines which remained after the glaciers melted away. We followed the lateral moraines and map the extremes. The landscape with U-valleys and cirques indicated \"classical\" mountain glaciers but we found also traces of the glacier which maid be the plateau type. The findings were surprising and somehow \"weird\" but the picture was every day clearer as we had composed our separate findings. The ground work was from the early morning to the late afternoon or even the night, but as it was interesting the day ran out even too fast. "

      "text":" Synopsis     The exhibition was based on the documentation of a year-and-a-half-long action of looking for work, evolving around an ad stating: Visual artist urgently looking for any kind of work, which was published continuously in local advertising publications.     While responses to the ad came mainly from men offering suspicious work such as massage, accompaniment on travels, nude photography, \u201cperformances\u201d in night bars..., the project also developed through researching job columns with an aim of undergoing the experience of work.     During the project, the artist worked as a cleaner, a waitress, a vendor, a distributor... In all cases, apart from the work found \u201cthrough a connection\u201d, she was underpaid and treated as a person of lower rank. Apart from dealing with the research into the labour market in a time of the highest unemployment rate in Croatia, the project Looking For Work questions the status of contemporary artists in Croatian society and problematizes the insufficiency of the artistic profession, with an emphasis on the position of women artists and the field of visual art.     The conditions in which (not only) Croatian visual artists work are cheap production, unpaid work, a non-existent contemporary art market and a lack of systematic promotion on an international level. Survival within the profession is possible only with external sources of income. "

The gallery was managed by Obalne galerije - Coastal Galleries. In 2014 the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia decided to rent a biennial exhibition space in Arsenale. See below the archival article.     Archival article     The A plus A, Slovenian Exhibition Centre in Venice is a non-profit exhibition space established in 1997, as a centre for the promotion of contemporary Slovene and international art. Up to 2014 it served as a site of the Slovene Pavillion for both the Venice Art Biennial and the Venice Architecture Biennial. Since 2014 the Slovene artists have been presented at Arsenale.     The gallery operates year-round to host temporary solo and group exhibitions of mostly Slovene artists. It has established a network of contacts between civic and foreign institutions and organises round tables, performances and video projections, thus offering a panoramic view of today's artistic expression and a point of meeting, exchange and critical dialogue.     Background     The A+A Gallery first opened its doors in 1992 in Madrid, inside a space divided by a corridor (hence the name A plus A) restored by architect Boris Podrecca. After five years of activities co-ordinated by Lidija \u0160ircelj, the gallery moved to Venice, near Palazzo Grassi.     Venice Art Biennial participation     In 2015 JA\u0160A presents UTTER \/ The violent necessity for the embodied presence of hope, curated by Michele Drascek and Aurora Fonda.     Jasmina Cibic's project entitled For our Economy and Culture, curated by Tev\u017e Logar and produced by the City Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana in cooperation with the \u0160kuc Gallery, was selected to represent Slovenia at the 55th Venice Biennial in 2013. The exhibition is accompanied by the conference.     Sculptor Mirko Bratu\u0161a represented Slovenia at the 54th Venice Biennial in 2011 with the project dubbed Hot Emotion Heaters. At the A+A Gallery the two-metre-high clay figures called Hypocrites (previouosly shown at the Bo\u017eidar Jakac Gallery, Kostanjevica na Krki) were exhibited in the lower gallery grounds, while new, smaller statues were displayed in the upper room, and linked to the Venice environment and the biennial's concept ILLUMInazioni.     At the 53rd Venice Art Biennial in 2009, Miha \u0160trukelj's project x=0 \/ y=0: Interferences in Process. He examined the issue of perception in five equal segments: notes on a board, drawings, works on tracing paper, Lego-pictures and paintings as the final segment. This work was further based on researching the mechanism of perception, which \u0160trukelj analyses with the aid of traditional representational media \u2013 painting and drawing \u2013 but so as to include critical examination of the act of perception and the act of painting as committed existential acts of the contemporary subject.     At the 52nd Venice Art Biennial in 2007 Tobias Putrih featured in two-parts the project Venetian, Atmospheric. The first part of the installation, exhibited inside the gallery, included several maquettes, drawings, photographs, and sculptures which explored and questioned the relationship between architectural space and the scale models which precede it. The second, main part of the project was set up in a garden on the Island of San Servolo and consisted of a full-scale pavillion, a movie theatre.     Ten years after Russian-born artist Vadim Fi\u0161kin represented Russia in 1995 at the Venice Biennial, Fi\u0161kin's project Another Speedy Day was presented in the Slovene Pavillion at the 51st edition of the biennial. After forging professional and personal bonds in Slovenia he has become considered as a Slovene artist whose presence in Ljubljana contributes significantly to expanding the field of contemporary art in Slovenia.     Venice Architecture Biennial presentations     In 2014 the project The Problem of Space Travel - Supre: Architecture by the Cultural Centre of European Space Technologies (KSEVT), in 2012 the 100 YC (Maribor - 100 Year City) and in 2010 the All Shades of Green project by Studio AKKA and Studiobotas were presented at the Venice Bienniale of Architecture, supported by the Ministry of Culture at A plus A Gallery in Venice.     In 2008 the project Ljubljana \u2013 Venice: Urgent Need for New Urban Policy presented an architectural and urban comparison of the two cities, Ljubljana and Venice. On the 2006 Architecture Biennial Slovene participation was designed as a cabinet of ambient environments and icons entitled Formula New Ljubljana created by the SADAR + VUGA Architects in A+A Gallery and other locations in Venice.     Some other exhibitions     In 2008 A plus A gallery presented the exhibition The Partisans in Print: Slovenian Partisan Press & Graphic Art since 1941, curated by Donovan Pavlinec, featuring previously unpublished material in Italy: Slovene Partisan press, incisions, xylography, wartime banknotes and bills of exchange with reproductions of the patriotic activists designed by Slovenian artists and architects. Organised in co-operation with the International Centre of Graphic Arts in Ljubljana, in collaboration with the Slovenia's National Museum of Contemporary History, the exhibition and the accompanying catalogue offered a rare opportunity for scholars and members of the public to peruse visual testimony of social and political engagement at a critical moment in history.     Culture.si offers information on Slovene cultural producers, venues, festivals and support services, all in one place. It encourages international cultural exchange in the fields of arts, culture and heritage.

As one of the 17 institutes of the Scientific Research Centre at the Slovene Academy of Science and Arts (ZRC-SAZU), the Institute of Art History also maintains a library and documentation on Slovene art monuments and artists.     Contents     History     Originally founded in 1972 as the Section of Art History at the Institute of History, this institution was renamed in 1975 as the France Stele Institute of Art History after its first head, the leading Slovene art historian of the time and academician Dr. France Stele (1886\u20131972). He was a pioneer of Slovene art heritage protection and a leading conservator of monuments formed his doctrine of protection under the influence of the Vienna School of Art History, Alois Riegl and his mentor Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.     Programme     Special studies are dedicated to the art of the Romanesque and Baroque periods and of the 19th century, and to the work of architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik. The results of the researches also contribute to the preservation of artistic monuments, which represent essential components of Slovene national identity. Special attention is paid to exceptional individuals such as Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, Toma\u017e Hren, and Francesco Robba.     Library and publications     The institute's library includes some 15,000 works relating to art history and is part of the ZRC-SAZU central library. Information on recent acquisitions is accessible through the COBISS computer system, and older publications are catalogued in alphabetical files. The institute has topographic and personal card files of Slovene art monuments and artists, and a collection of photographs and slides. These are constantly being expanded with new information and research findings. Research results are published as scientific papers in the institute's own journal and other periodicals and in monographs, with emphasis laid on Baroque sculpture and painting.     The central scientific publication of the institute is the annual Acta Historiae Artis Slovenica. Current reviews of publications, exhibitions, interviews with art historians and artists is published in the quarterly Art Chronicle Bulletin that was launched in 2003.     In 2013 the publication Le sang et le lait dans l\u2019imaginaire m\u00e9di\u00e9val [Blood and Milk in the Medieval Imagery] by Jure Miku\u017e was published online in French language (cf. link below).     Collaboration     The institute collaborates with Slovene and foreign experts as well as with galleries, museums, heritage conservation organisations and art history institutes, both in Slovenia and abroad (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, and Hungary).     In collaboration with SAUR Allgemeines K\u00fcnstlerlexikon (AKL) the Institute of Art History collected a database of 3,688 artists that were active in Slovenia throughout history until the early-20th century. It is also a backbone for bibliographic and biographic encyclopaedia of artists working in Slovenia in the past.     Since 2014 the Institute has taken part in the EU project Women's Creativity since the Modern Movement (MoMoWo) that highlights the diverse contributions of women in design professions. The Institute closely collaborated with the Center for Architecture Slovenia.     Research programme and projects     The research group led by Dr. Barbara Murovec focuses on research about the Slovene artistic identity in Europe. Current topics of research deal with the Art Topography of Slovenia, the Valvasor Collection of Prints, Noble Maecenas and their Role in Sacral Art from the 16th to the 19th Century, etc.     The France Stele Institute of Art History also organises a 6-day Summer School focused on insights into field work methods of art topography.

      "text":" HIDSENZ \u2013 Pressure sensor for controlling the injection moulding process     The main objective of the project is to develop a new product \u2013 a pressure sensor for controlling the injection moulding process.     We are developing a pressure sensor for controlling the injection moulding process, with the following characteristics:     diagnostics, prognostics and self-maintenance of smart machines and processes;     design of new components that will contribute to stronger integration of the physical and digital world in factories of the future;     development of modern tools and components for systems and processes monitoring and control.     Project description:     In response to the globalisation of business and manufacturing processes and the increasing demands for quality and security, the worldwide need for intelligent management systems in automated processes is growing. The need to monitor production processes in real time is growing, especially in the automotive industry, where the built-in safety components are crucial. Injection of plastic materials is often a blind process, since the user relies on the process parameters of the injection moulding machine itself, but at the same time does not have a direct insight into what is happening in the mould. For the needs of the automotive industry, Hidria AET has developed a pressure sensor called the Hidria Optymus Pressure Sensing System, which is integrated into the Pressure Sensor Glow Plug (PSG) for the requirements of EURO 6 and EURO 7. Hidria has been awarded the CLEPA Association of European Automobile Suppliers for this innovation. Knowledge and technological processes of the development of PSG plugs with pressure sensor will be used to develop a pressure sensor that can be used in industrial processes, for example, injection moulding of polymer materials, aluminium and magnesium die casting, LSR processing, powder spraying, etc.     The key objective of the pressure sensor development is to increase the efficiency of the use of resources in order to reduce electricity and water consumption during processing, reduce the consumption of raw materials and increase the use of recycled materials with the goal of sustainable development.     Hidria and TECOS, in accordance with the objectives of the fifth priority of Slovenia's development strategy, will have to influence the reduction of energy and material intensity. For both partners, the HIDSENZ project means the adoption of new specific expertise in key areas, for example, in the field of monitor, control and optimisation of the injection process with the help of a developed pressure sensor and the development of modern complex injection moulds that will have integrated and affordable pressure sensors.     The role of TECOS:     The role of TECOS is predominantly to extensively test, validate and improve the functionality of the developed prototype pressure sensor as well as performing comparative tests with existing pressure sensors on a specially developed prototype injection mould.     The investment is co - financed by the Republic of Slovenia and the European Union from the European Regional Development Fund.

      "text":" Fermi Masterclass 2019 - NASA in highschools     What is it?     Masterclasses (typically given by big experiments such as LHC) are International events which provide an opportunity for high-school students to experience first-hand data analysis. CAC\/UNG will organize such event, using the data a NASA satellite Fermi LAT on April 5th, 2019 in coordination with four Italian Institutions University of Bari, University of Perugia, University of Torino and University of Trieste.     The topic and objectives     The topic of the masterclass will be Active Galactic Nuclei and Multi-Messenger astrophysics. One of the great examples of modern multi-messenger astrophysics was a discovery of high-energy neutrino, which was detected simultaneously with gamma-rays from a flairing AGN (a faraway black hole), detected first by the Fermi LAT and shown schematically on the image to the right. Such discovery resulted in Science article.     During the Masterclass, students will learn the basic concepts in gamma-ray astronomy and will get a chance to analyze the light curve of AGNs first hand.     The goal of the exercise will be to localize the flaring of a powerful AGN, much like the one that resulted in detected neutrino emission in 2018. The results will then be compared with those from other astrophysics centers in Italy, who will perform a similar analysis in different time intervals and the light curve of this source will be drawn together.     Tentative Programme     10:00 -10:15 Welcome     10:15-10:45 Intro to Gamma-Ray astronomy     10:45-11:15 Intro to Black Hole (astro-) physics and multi-messenger astrophysics     16:15 \u2013 16:30 Comparison of student work with other institutions     16:30 \u2013 17:15 Video Call with NASA scientist \u2013 Prof. David Thompson from NASA Godard     17:15 End of activities     Who can apply and how to register?     The event is intended for interested high-school students. It is held during a school day, so the agreement from physics teachers will be needed.     To register, please send an email specifying your full name, school, class and the name of the physics professor to: fermi.masterclass.ung@gmail.com     Please note that the number of places is limited, attendance will be on a first come first served base.

In 1999, the EBR transformed into a modern scientific journal with an international editorial board serving countries outside of Slovenia.     One of the strengths of the journal is its multi-disciplinary approach, as it offers a selection of articles from three disciplines: economics, organisational, and business studies. Articles address problems in the Slovenian and European business environments.

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Interbank overnight interest rates: October sees the \u20acSTR replace the EONIA     07\/17\/2019 \/ Press release     A change will be made to interbank overnight interest rates on 2 October 2019: the current EONIA will be replaced by the Euro Short-Term Rate or \u20acSTR. The ECB will publish the \u20acSTR every trading day by 9 am CET. The EONIA will remain in use until the end of 2021, but in the interim (i.e. from 2 October 2019) it will be calculated as the \u20acSTR plus a fixed spread of 8.5 basis points. The Bank of Slovenia finds that the proportion of contracts in Slovenia tied to the EONIA is very low in value terms. The majority of financial instruments are tied to the EURIBOR, where the reforms are not yet finalised.     The benchmark interest rates most commonly used for euro-denominated financial contracts are the EONIA and the EURIBOR, which are provided by the European Money Markets Institute (EMMI). The majority of financial instruments are tied to the EURIBOR, which is used in bank loan agreements, and is also widely used in derivatives contracts.     Figure 1: Proportion of contracts tied to EURIBOR and EONIA (stock, end of May 2018), value terms, %     Sources: European Securities and Markets Authority, Bank of Slovenia     Reforms to benchmark interest rates     Recent years have seen reforms to the benchmark interest rates, as the existing benchmarks were no longer reflecting their true values, and there were deficiencies in their provision. Two years ago the Governing Council of the ECB therefore resolved to develop a euro risk-free overnight interest rate, which is known as Euro Short-Term Rate (\u20acSTR) and enters into force on 2 October 2019.     The \u20acSTR will reflect the cost of borrowing cash from banks on the wholesale money market. It will replace the EONIA (Euro OverNight Index Average), which will remain in use until the end of 2021. In the interim (i.e. from 2 October 2019 until the end of 2021) the EONIA will be calculated as the \u20acSTR plus a fixed spread of 8.5 basis points.     The ECB is already publishing a test interest rate, the pre-\u20acSTR, which is calculated using the same methods as the \u20acSTR, and is also a key element in the calculation of the fixed spread (8.5 basis points was the spread between the EONIA and the pre-\u20acSTR between 17 April 2018 and 16 April 2019).     EURIBOR remains in force     In contrast to the EONIA, the Eurosystem does not have a direct role in the reforms to euro benchmark interest rates of longer maturities. The activities to reform the EURIBOR, which is remaining in force, are being led by the EMMI. It is planning to use a hybrid methodology to calculate the new EURIBOR, which will allow the interest rate to be calculated on the basis of transactions, at least in part. The selection of transactions has been expanded to include wholesale funding from other financial institutions that credit institutions obtain on the unsecured money market. The hybrid methodology for calculating EURIBOR interest rates will enter into full force by the end of 2019.     More information about the reforms to the benchmark interest rates can be found online at the ECB and the EMMI. "

      "text":" Chemistry     Chemistry was one of the foundation disciplines in an Institute devoted initially to research in nuclear energy. Laboratories for analytical chemistry and for fluorination and preparation of uranium hexafluoride were established, and these two general areas are still actively pursued today. In the fifties the first flame atomic spectrometer and the first mass spectrometer in Yugoslavia were built on site, and the use of atomic absorption and emission spectroscopy for determining metals was introduced. Work in the fluorination laboratory concentrated first on the production of elemental fluorine and on management of the demanding experimental techniques for work with this aggressive element. Investigations connected with ceramic nuclear fuel based on uranium dioxide followed soon after. From the beginning, much of the Institute's chemical research has had direct applications in view, and this is reflected in the number of contracts with Slovenian industry. It has resulted in the development of technologically demanding products such as varistors, microwave resonators, capacitors, PTC resistors, sensors, ferrites, rare earth permanent magnets, hybrid circuits, and mechanically resistant ceramics. Co-operation with industrial partners in Slovenia includes the production of mineral fibres for thermal isolation, and the manufacture of glass. Among other European industrial partners there is a cooperation with the MAN Roland Druckmaschinen company on the development of ferroelectric cylinders for a new form of printing.     Today chemistry based research in the Institute follows four main directions. In the field of synthetic chemistry of inorganic fluorine compounds, synthesis of the then unknown xenon hexafluoride and photosynthesis of krypton difluoride in liquefied fluorine are important landmarks. The latter is still valid today as the most successful method for the synthesis of krypton difluoride. One hundred fold greater quantities can be prepared than with other methods, resulting in extensive investigations of high energy oxidizers. This has led, in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley, to the synthesis and characterization of a series of higher binary fluorides of silver, copper and nickel - a highly significant achievement. Fluorination reactions of organic molecules are also studied, including an important long-term collaboration with BASF investigating the fluorination of polymeric materials. The Institute is known internationally for its contribution to the processing of ceramics and specialized alloys. The most important scientific achievements include the synthesis of microwave dielectric ceramics and establishing a correlation between their structure and properties, the explanation of the positive temperature coefficient of resistance for ferroelectric ceramics and a contribution to understanding ceramic toughness. Recently much effort has been put into the synthesis of nanocrystalline particles, into ferroelectric thin films for micro-sensors and micro-actuators, and into bio-compatible materials. Protection of the environment and the development of clean, environment-friendly technologies rank high in the chemists' concerns. Desulphurization of chimney gases, selective thermal decomposition of nitrogen oxides, environment friendly incineration of solid and liquid wastes and the use of chemical monitoring in the management of technological processes are typical examples of helping to minimize industrial pollution. More basic research includes studies of catalytic reactions associated with environmental pollution. An important thrust is the development and use of analytical methods for determining elements and their chemical species, radionuclides and organic pollutants in the biosphere. By measuring stable isotopes, sources of pollution can be detected and the paleoclimatic background can be studied. The results are used primarily for modelling natural processes and for evaluating influences of industrial intervention on the environment. Industrial and health associated projects include studies of the processes of corrosion and of passivation of technologically important metals and alloys, such as in solid protection layers, metal and polymer orthopaedic implants, and primary zinc batteries.

Kako je z izvedbo ob\u010dnega zbora, se lahko opravijo pristrelitve in organizirajo tekme?     Vlada je 14. maja preklicala epidemijo COVID-19, ki je bila razgla\u0161ena 12. marca 2020. To pomeni, da se spreminja tudi veljavnost interventnih ukrepov, vendar se ukrepi, ki so bili sprejeti na podlagi Zakona o nalezljivih boleznih \u0161e vedno uporabljajo. Tako je med drugim z Odlokom o za\u010dasni splo\u0161ni omejitvi zbiranja ljudi na javnih krajih in mestih v RS, ki je pri\u010del veljati 18. maja, \u0161e vedno omejeno zbiranje ve\u010d kot 50 ljudi na javnih krajih in mestih.     Foto: Marjan To\u0161     Ob\u010dni zbori     Izvedba ob\u010dnih zborov lovskih dru\u017ein se po na\u0161em mnenju ne \u0161teje za zbiranje ljudi na javnem kraju in mestu, ker gre za zaprti (vabljeni) krog ljudi, in ni podvr\u017eena omejitvi navedenega odloka. Skratka, je izvedena v lovskem domu, ki ni javni kraj.     Kljub temu predlagamo upo\u0161tevanje splo\u0161nih navodil in priporo\u010dil Nacionalnega in\u0161tituta za varovanje zdravja (NIJZ) za zamejitev \u0161irjenja virusa bolezni COVID-19, to je zagotoviti zadostno varnostno razdaljo med udele\u017eenci in uporabo za\u0161\u010ditnih sredstev. \u010ce ob\u010dni zbor traja ve\u010d kot eno uro, je potrebno prostore v tem \u010dasu tudi prezra\u010diti.     Pristrelitve     Pod enakimi pogoji se lahko izvajajo tudi pristrelitve in druga dela v lovi\u0161\u010du. Z nekaj organizacijskimi prijemi (razporejanje lovcev na \u010dasovne termine, klicanje posameznika na strelsko mesto) je veliko LD \u017ee izvedlo pristrelitve, zato predsednik LZS ne bo podalj\u0161al veljavnosti nastrelitve, ki sicer velja do 31. maja 2020!     Tekmovanja     S 23. majem se spro\u0161\u010dajo omejitve na podro\u010dju \u0161portnih programov, tako se lahko ponovno izvajajo \u0161portne dejavnosti v \u0161portnih objektih in na povr\u0161inah za \u0161port v naravi (tudi v \u0161portnih objektih, ki so sestavni del vzgojno-izobra\u017eevalnih zavodov). Vadba je dovoljena registriranim \u0161portnikom, prav tako je dovoljena prosto\u010dasna \u0161portna vzgoja otrok in mladine, ob\u0161tudijska \u0161portna dejavnost, \u0161port invalidov, \u0161portna rekreacija in \u0161port starej\u0161ih. Dovoljeno je tudi izvajanje vseh \u0161portnih tekmovanj do vklju\u010dno dr\u017eavne ravni, in sicer v panogah, ki imajo evidentiran uradni tekmovalni sistem, za zdaj brez prisotnosti gledalcev.

      "text":" 8th European Congress of Mathematics closes with great success     1766 registered participants, more than 1000 contributions, numerous distinguished speakers     Inspite of the insecure circumstances, Slovenian coastal town Portoro\u017e hosted the 8th ECM from June 20 to June 26, 2021. The largest scientific meeting of mathematicians in Europe takes place every four years under the auspices of European Mathematical Society (EMS).     8ECM flag in front of the entrance to the congress centre     During the congress, only about 200 of altogether 1766 registered participants were able to attend the congress venue in person. The others were unable to travel to Slovenia due to COVID crisis, so the official congress programme was completely available online. However, a number of speakers present in Portoro\u017e did broadcast their lectures live from the congress halls, where they spoke in front of the small audience.     The reception hall was decorated by posters of historical Slovene mathematicians     I have arrived to the Congress Centre on Sunday, June 20, in the afternoon. I was really impressed by a nicely decorated reception hall, where several congress booklets and other materials were given out by kind volunteers along with several promotion materials on Slovenia. Also, two interesting exihibitions were greeting the newly arrived: mathematical stamps (by Robin Wilson) and historical Slovenian mathematicians Vega, Plemelj, Mo\u010dnik, Vidav and Lah (by Marko and Nada Razpet and Izidor Hafner).     Book of abstracts and other congress materials     After the welcome reception with speeches and music at a lovely plateou with a seaside view, attendants walked along the coast to a nearby gallery Monfort, where several interesting graphic artworks with mathematical background were exhibited: collection Mathematics in Colors by Bogdan Soban, Random Art by Andrej Bauer and selected mathematical posters by staff and students of the Mathematics department at the University of Ljubljana..     In the following days, the guests were also offered a piano evening by Teja Jeli\u010di\u0107, a visit of artwork exhibition \"X\" of Teja Kra\u0161ek in the nearby town Izola, poster exhibition \"European Women of Mathematics\" at the University of Primorska in Koper, as well as a visit to a marine biology station or several math sculpture workshops for the children.     A piano evening by a talented student Tea Jeli\u010di\u0107, also an ex- IMO and EGMO participant     The 8ECM really started on Monday, June 21st, in the morning, with an online Opening Ceremony. The opening speeches were held by Slovenian president Borut Pahor, the president of EMS Volker Mehrmann, the chair of the Organizing Committee Toma\u017e Pisanski, and rector of the host institution Klavdija Kutnar.     Opening adress of prof. Volker Mehrmann, EMS president     The opening adresses were followed by EMS prize committe chair Martin Bridson, Otto Neugebauer prize committee chair Eberhardt Knobloch and Felixa Kleina prize committee Ralf Korn, who presented the awards. Each of the 12 award recepients was represented by a 3 minute video portrait. On behalf of the prize recepients, Karine Chemla, the Otto Neugebauer prize recepient, thanked the committee and the organizers for their commitment to make the congress as memorable as possible.     Karine Chemla, the Otto Neugebauer prize recepient, spoke live on behalf of the prize recipients     The scientific programme of the congress opened by an incredibly interesting plenary lecture by Alfio Quateroni on mathematical models of heart and blood circulation. The lecture on minimal surfaces from the complex analisys point of view by Franc Forstneri\u010d was the first ever plenary lecture by a Slovene mathematician in the history of ECM. Other plenary lectures were also excellent, with two lectures on deep\/statistical learning by Gitta Kutinyok and Peter Buhlmann standing a bit out of the more traditional topics from algebraic geometry, combinatorics, analysis and probability.     Plenary lecture by prof. Franc Forstneri\u010d     Unfortunately, the 10 EMS prize talks were presented in 5 parallel sections, so I could only attend two. The first one was by Kaisa Matomaki on primes and almost primes in short intervals, and the second one by Alexander Logunov on zero sets of Laplacian eigenfunctions.     The announcement of the EMS prize lecture by Kaisa Matomaki     The 30 invited lectures were also very interesting, and I was really impressed by Daniela Kuhn's latest results on the famous Erdos-Faber-Lovasz conjecture on the edge-chromatic number of hypergraphs. 3 of the invited lectures were also contributed by Slovenian mathematicians. \u0160pela \u0160penko presented the concept of HMS categorical symmetries and hypergeometric systems as an extension of Plemelj's solution of the 21st Hibert problem on existence of DE system with a prescribed monodromy group. Aleksey Kostenko presented the two complementing types of Laplacian operators in the context of infinite graphs, while Andrej Bauer convinced me that the recent formalization of mathematics by using type theory instead of set theory is changing foundaments of mathematics.     The Abel lecture by Laszlo Lovasz was the scientific peak of 8ECM     Among the lectures mentioned so far, some others also stood out. This year's Abel prize winner (together with Avi Widgerson) Laszlo Lovasz dedicated his Abel lecture to hot topic of connecting continuous and discrete mathematics by using graph limits - graphons. Among the 6 public lectures, we were able to hear a lectures by Robin Wilson on the history of math in Europe (through stamps), Bojan Mohar on the crossing numbers, Kathrynn Hess on topological applications in neuroscience, Martin Hairer on mathematical journey through scales, Fields medalist Stanislav Smirnov on mathematics and art and Fields medalist Alexeia Okounkova on Lie Theory without groups.     A public lecture by Fields medalist Stanislav Smirnov     A majority of the remaining more tha 1000 contributed talks were shorter and distributed within 62 minisymposiums that were proposed by their organizers and confirmed by the local scientific committee, chaired by Dragan Maru\u0161i\u010d. We shall only list the ones organized or coorganized by our Slovenian colleagues:: Energy methods and their application in material science (org. Martin Jesenko), Mathematics in biology and medicine (org. Barbara Boldin), Mathematical challenges in insurance (org. Mihael Perman), Mathematics in the Digital age of Science (org. Katja Ber\u010di\u010d), Algorithmic Graph Theory (coorg. Martin Milani\u010d and Sandi Klav\u017ear), Spectral Theory and Integrable Systems (coorg. Aleksey Kostenko), Harmonic analysis and partial differential equations (org. Oliver Dragi\u010devi\u0107), Mathematics in education (org. Amalija \u017dakelj), Noncommutative structures within order structures, semigroups and universal algebra (org. Karin Cvetko-Vah, coorg. Joao Pita Costa), Symmetry of Graphs, Maps and Polytopes (org. Primo\u017e Poto\u010dnik, coorg. Primo\u017e \u0160parl), Low dimensional topology (org. Sa\u0161o Strle), Computational aspects of commutative and noncommutative positive polynomials (coorg. Igor Klep), Topics in complex and quaternionic geometry (org. Jasna Prezelj), Analysis on graphs (org. Aleksey Kostenko), Complex analysis and geometry (org. Franc Forstneri\u010d), Recent developments on preservers (org. Bojan Kuzma).     A coffee break during a congress session     Apart from the main congress programme, several other special events also took place during the 8ECM: a panel discussion on ERC, a panel discussion on gender ballance in mathematics, a panel discussion on open access in mathematics, the annual meeting of LMS and the annual meeting of EWM. For the younger generation, a carrier day with presentations of study and employment at several European institutions, a reception of the IMO and EGMO medalists, and the prize ceremony of the student competition for projects in financial math. Aside of the congress, the editorial board of (Slovenian) international scientific journals Ars Mathematica Contemporanea and Art of Discrete and Applied Mathematics presented the Petra \u0160parl annual award for their best recent paper by a female mathematician, which was shared by Simona Bonvicini and Klavdija Kutnar.     The Organizing Committee cochair Klavdija Kutnar, also rector of University of Primorska     The programme of the last day of the congress has finished by a longer live interview with current ERC president and EMS ex-president Jean Pierre Bourguignon, who shared with the audience his vivid thoughts on the role of mathematics, universities, science and research in the current society. He also stressed the importance of math teacher education, which is necessary to develop new mathematical talents on our own, European ground.     Fields medalist Aleksei Okounkov invited the community to attend the ICM2022 in Sankt Petersburg     After that, the congress was closed with a nice ceremony. EMS president Volker Mehrmann thanked the main organizers Toma\u017e Pisanski and Klavdija Kutnar for their incredible efforts and reliance, while representatives of Spanich and Russian organizers invited the audience to attend ICM2022 in Skt. Petersburg and ECM2024 in Sevilla.     Predsednik Organizacijskega odbora Toma\u017e Pisanski s sodelavci ob zaklju\u010dku kongresa     In my opinion, the 8ECM successfully presented the current image of European mathematics with its most propulsing young names as well as the distinguished senior researchers. We should be proud of our colleagues at the University of Primorska and their main supporters University of Ljubljana, University of Maribor, IMFM, DMFA, SDAMS, Abelium, and IJS, to have managed to succesfully organize such a huge event in this incredibly difficult times. I believe this opinion is shared by most other participants and I congratulate the organizers sincerely for their amazing effort.

      "text":" Slovenski etnografski muzej     Africa of the three museums     Many museums around Slovenia hold materials from non-European countries in their collection, including objects from Africa. Three museums particularly emphasise African collections, which are part of their permanent exhibitions already for decades. The Slovene Ethnographic Museum, Velenje Museum and Carinthian Regional Museum present, through exhibitions and different museum programs, the rich heritage of African cultures to the wider public. This includes objects from pharaonic Egypt to modern creations of African artists.     The Slovene Ethnographic Museum carefully documents all forms of connections between Slovenians and Africa that have been continuously in existence since the 19th century. Besides the rich material heritage, the museum keeps also an important collection of photographs and archival documents.     The permanent exhibition at the Velenje Museum has been already for many years presenting the exceptional life story of the Czech sculptor, writer, and traveller, Franti\u0161ek Foit. Complicated circumstances brought him and his wife Irena from Kenya to Velenje. Consequently, today the visitors can admire the picturesque collection of masks, statues, and traditional sculptural products of Foit\u2019s students, exhibited within the castle.     The Carinthian Regional Museum keeps a diverse collection of Dr Franc Tretjak, an economist and one of the leading Slovenian experts for the analysis and development of the African economy in the period of the Non-Aligned Movement. While his collection, photographic and film archives are important, the crucial is his literary view on Africa \u2013 realistic, critical, and visionary.     The group exhibition project Africa of the Three Museums was created to commemorate the first African exhibition in 1850, and its author Dr Ignacij Knoblehar (1819\u20131858), a missionary and explorer of the White Nile. At the celebration of the 200th anniversary of his birth, we wish that spiritual and material heritage of African peoples in the three Slovenian museums would enrich our knowledge on that part of the world that is considered a cradle of humankind.

      "text":" In case of symptoms suspected of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, cold, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting), make an appointment over the phone and do not enter community health centre unannounced.     IMPORTANT NOTICE     Dear patients,     With the phasing-out of measures at the national level and the order of the Ministry of Health on temporary measures in the field of health care in view of containment and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, Community Health Centre Ljubljana has gradually begun increasing the scope of available health care services. Given the current epidemiological situation, from the point of view of safety of patients and medical staff alike, caution is still required, as well as the use of personal protective equipment and taking all the measures necessary to prevent corona virus infection.     Check-up with a GP and all other activities at the Community Health Centre Ljubljana are only possible after a prior appointment and consultation with the medical staff (over the phone or via e-mail). Your GP will assess your medical condition and reach a professional decision about any necessary treatment. The assessment can be made via e-mail, over the phone, or directly through a medical check-up.     If you have symptoms and show signs of COVID-19, your GP will refer you over the phone for swab testing and\/or a check-up at a COVID clinic, therefore never visit the health centre unannounced.     In the event of a life-threatening condition, call 112 immediately.     For your scheduled appointment, please arrive at the health centre no more than 5 minutes before the appointment.     At the entrance to the health centre, disinfect your hands and put on a surgical mask; wear the mask at all times for the duration of your visit.     Please observe a personal safety distance of at least 1.5 metres in all areas of the health centre.     On the day before your check-up, you should receive a call from the medical staff, who will check your medical and epidemiological condition by means of a questionnaire. It is advisable to print out and fill in the Questionnaire for the assessment of medical condition before treatment in the outpatient clinic at home, and bring it with you for your scheduled appointment.     Only healthy persons should come for a check-up. If a person falls ill, we kindly ask them to inform us of the fact and so waive their appointment time to somebody else.     ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES (PRESCRIPTIONS, SICK LEAVE ...)     All administrative services, such as issuing prescriptions for chronic therapy, referrals for check-ups, orders for medical devices, at the discretion of the GP possibly also sick leave, are performed remotely over the phone or, most preferably, by e-mail. When contacting us via e-mail, please state your name and surname, date of birth, Health Insurance Card number and the telephone number where you can be reached.     ENTERING THE HEALTH CENTRE     With the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the population, entering the Community Health Centre Ljubljana is limited and runs exclusively through the triage point. We ask all patients entering the health centre to provide the nurse with ACCURATE and TRUE information about their health condition, possible visits to high-risk areas and any close contact with infected persons. Providing untrue information means endangering one\u2019s own health and everyone else\u2019s.     WEEKENDS, PUBLIC HOLIDAYS AND NIGHT-TIME     On weekends, public holidays and at night, the paediatric emergency first-aid service (PNMP) and adult emergency first-aid service (SNMP) run in an unchanged manner. In case of symptoms suspected of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, cold, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting), make an appointment over the phone and do not visit the emergency service unannounced.     Before seeking emergency medical help, consider whether a check-up is necessary or whether you can wait for the workday to call your personal or a substitute practitioner.     Quality     Community Health Centre Ljubljana is an important part of Slovenian primary healthcare, employing over 1500 people and covering approximately half a million residents. In the last years we began the project of implementing quality standards into our everyday activities as one of the key public healthcare organizations in central Slovenian region. The managed implementation of quality into our activities, health care providers at our Health Centre was provided a chance to unify good practice across all units and to start new activities in a structured, controlled and documented manner. All this was done to ensure that users of our services receive an even higher quality of treatment.     On February 1st, 2012, Community Health Centre Ljubljana received ISO 9001:2008 certificate for successful implementation of quality system. This only provided the foundations for quality system management, and lots of work was still to be done. As the next step we decided to acquire DIAS international accreditation, which we received on October 30, 2013, as the first community health centre in Slovenia. However, the real work has only just begun, since quality requires a constant process of improvement, adjustment and identification of new requirements within our environment. In 2018, we successfully passed ISO 9001: 2015 and at the same time gained the EN 15224: 2016 certificate, an international European standard for health.     In our commitment to increase the level of satisfaction for our employees, we were awarded the Family-friendly organization title. This title supports our attempts for improving work process management and quality of our work environment to ease the organization of professional and private life for our employees.     Quality systems are \u2013 similar to an organization \u2013 a living system, which needs to be adjusted, corrected, and developed in the sense of finding new, more rational ways in relations between patients and healthcare workers. Our wish is to be competitive in this context and to be known for our excellent work and high-quality approach towards work and development in Slovenia's healthcare.     Every employee of Community Health Centre Ljubljana is an important building block of the quality system, contributing to our common goal \u2013 higher quality of healthcare services for our patients.

      "text":" INJECTABLE FILLERS     Rejuvenates the skin, smoothens wrinkles and enhances lips or facial contours with no downtime.     SHORT SUMMARY     fillers are injected into the skin or using very fine needles, along wrinkles and lines or into soft tissues that have lost volume with age     can temporary eliminate signs of aging and postpone more invasive surgical procedures but cannot replace them     injectable substances vary considerably in physical properties and clinical performance     hyaluronic acid fillers last from 6-12 months     What is an injectable filler?     Injectable fillers also known as wrinkle fillers, dermal fillers or facial soft tissue fillers are soft gel substances that are injected under the skin to fill in deep facial lines and creases. They are also used for correction of defects or depressions in the face resulting from age or trauma, to restore volume loss from aging in areas such as the under the eye and cheeks, or to enhance the lips or cheeks. When performed by an experienced plastic surgeon and with appropriate filler for the specific application, soft tissue augmentation and dermal filling provide predictable and consistent aesthetic outcomes. Immediate results with minimal risks an almost no downtime together with the current trend toward less invasive nonsurgical rejuvenating procedures makes them increasingly popular. However, it should be kept clear that when used for correct indications they can temporary eliminate signs of aging and postpone more invasive surgical procedures but cannot replace them. To learn more about current approach to facial rejuvenation, please follow the link.     What areas can be treated with injectable filler?     Depending on the type of filler and the depth at which it is injected fillers can be used :     for correction of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and skin folds. Most commonly treated are the nasolabial folds (which run from the nose to the corner of the mouth), marionete lines (that run down from the corners of the mouth to the jaw), vertical lines on the upper lip.     to increase the size of the lips as well as to improve the definition of the cupid\u2019s bow or vermilion border. Anybody considering permanent lip augmentation should preliminary try augmentation with absorbable filler to get an idea about the outcome.     to fill in the lines and hollowness underneath the lower eyelids called the tear troughs     to rejuvenate and add volume to cheeks or chin     to improve contour deformities and recessed scars     to rejuvenate the hands     to correct inverted nipples     What are different types of injectable fillers?     In recent years, the number of available fillers increased dramatically, expanding the range of options available to patients. The injectable substances vary considerably in physical properties and clinical performance. Based on the source they may be classified as autologous, biological, or synthetic and based on duration of cosmetic benefit they may temporary (short, medium or long lasting) or permanent.     Who should perform treatments with injectable fillers?     To reliably achieve successful outcomes, the physician must have a thorough understanding of facial anatomy and the injection technique to be employed. In addition different characteristics, capabilities, risks, and limitations of the injected material must be well known in order to provide optimal care and avoid complications. At the initial consultation, the relative merits of injectable fillers and other competing or complementary surgical treatments must be discussed with the patient. Duration of effect, advantages and drawbacks for each option should be clearly presented. The physician must also have the ability to prevent unnecessary discomfort during treatment, and must be able to identify and manage complications, should they arise during or after treatment. Our goal is to provide individualized treatment, taking into account factors such as the patient\u2019s social schedule, aesthetic preferences, desires and complications tolerance. Attention to differences in skin thickness and texture, area to be treated and age, warrant a customized approach for a natural result and high patient satisfaction rate.     What is most frequently used injectable filler?     The most popular fillers are those made from cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA), which is naturally occurring substance in our bodies. It attracts water and hydrates the skin. A major advantage of HA fillers is that they can be quickly and easily reversed by the injection of hyaluronidase (an enzyme which breaks down hyaluronic acid) into areas in which elimination of the filler is desired. The biocompatibility, long-lasting (but not permanent) effects, broad range of facial aesthetic applications, low incidence of complications, reversibility, and versatility are characteristics of HA fillers that guarantee good results and a high level of patient satisfaction. Therefore, only limited subsets of physicians and patients are willing to accept the higher complexity and risks associated with the use of permanent fillers.     How long does the hyaluronic acid filler last?     Different injectable fillers last different periods of time in different patient, since each patient, metabolizes filler differently. The results of objective scientific studies have shown that hyaluronic acid fillers last from 6-12 months. In areas of increased activity such as around the mouth fillers are absorbed faster compared to the other sites.     What are potential risks and disadvantages?     All of the injectable fillers are placed by an injection and carry the usual risks of bruising, swelling, minimal pain and local infection. With appropriate use, the most popular, hyaluronic acid fillers have less than 1% incidence of adverse reactions. In addition, complications are rarely serious and usually resolve without treatment. Resolution can also be significantly accelerated by injection of hyaluronidase. In contrast to these fillers, longer lasting and permanent fillers may produce undesirable effects and complications that are more difficult or impossible to manage. More serious adverse reactions include areas of excess fullness or nodules, allergic reactions, granulomatous or inflammatory reactions, migration of filler, severe infection. Complications associated with fillers may require injection of corticosteroids, treatment with systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics, surgical intervention or incision of the affected area with a large bore needle and expression of the filler.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

      "text":" smart plastics in train washing plant | igus     Specification     The train washing plant of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL) cleans local and long-distance trains daily in its 200 m washing hall. In order to ideally clean different train lengths, 4 washing trolleys (a total of 8 washing trolleys) each are installed on either longitudinal side of the hall. Each washing trolley is supplied with power, data, compressed air as well as water and cleaning agent over a travel distance of 66 m by a gliding igus\u00ae energy chain.     The challenge     The previous energy chain systems of a competitor caused disruptions in the operation of the plant, as they were partially rising or otherwise falling off. This was particularly problematic because the washing plant is operated autonomously and a failure of an energy chain system could bring the entire washing process to a halt. The necessary repair measures were therefore time-consuming and partly necessary at night and on weekends. If the energy chain failed, the possibility of a rail vehicle being locked up in the wash bay could not be ruled out, which could mean the failure of several train runs.     Solution     The aim was to find a product that not only safely supplies the washing trolleys with data, voltage, compressed air, water and cleaning agents, but also fulfils CFL's requirement to operate Europe's most modern train washing plant. For this purpose, a system was required that allows the operator to monitor each individual energy chain and to avoid a breakdown of the plant. Besides an igus\u00ae energy chain designed for long travels, igus\u00ae smart plastics components were installed. Sensors monitor the status of every igus\u00ae energy chain during operation with regard to the application of force but also with regard to wear and tear and inform in good time as soon as a repair or replacement is required. In the course of the modernisation of the energy chain systems, the entire cleaning system was also renewed, so that in addition to particularly environmentally friendly cleaning agents, the used washing water can also be reused again and again through reprocessing.

      "text":" Catfishing in Spain: Ultimate River Ebro Fishing Guide     When it comes to catfishing, river Ebro is the best location in Spain, and one of the best in Europe. Keep on reading to find out all you need to know.     Located on the Iberian Peninsula, Ebro river is the longest river flowing entirely within the Spanish borders.     From the source until it reaches the sea, this river flows through multiple towns, and attracts tourists from all over the world.     More importantly, Ebro river is a famous fishing location. It is home to carp, various predatory fish, even some endemic fish species, but most of all to enormous wels catfish and channel catfish.     When it comes to catfishing, river Ebro is the best location for catfishing in Spain, and one of the best in Europe.     It is ideal for both experienced anglers and beginners.     There are numerous tourist agencies located nearby, offering unforgettable fishing experiences.     If you are in a search for excellent catfishing location, keep on reading to find out everything you need to know about catfishing in Ebro river.     Where and when to catfishing on Ebro river     If you are not sure where to go and you don\u2019t want to be bothered with searching for a perfect spot, you can always contact a local agency to book a fishing trip.     Location     For the ones more adventurous, there is no limit.     Catfish can be found in usual places such as deep holes, covered and protected area, shelves and ponds. Crowded locations should be avoided if possible.     Some anglers even use online maps and satellite images of the area to choose a location.     Wels catfish can be found along the whole river length but the lower river is home to some really huge specimens.     Catfish that weigh more than 100 pounds are quite frequent. Some specimens were more than 250 centimetres long, weighing more than 200 pounds.     It is hard to single out the best locations, but according to some experienced anglers, you should try fishing near Mequineza village, where fish live in smaller number, but they are greater in size.     Another good location is near Caspe village.     Large fish move around, and some anglers choose location where river is not so wide so that they can intercept them, as they are able to cover the whole area.     Season     When talking about seasons, some are better than other for catfishing in Spain.     Autumn, from September to November, is good because of the river level, which is stable. Also, fish are trying to feed as much as they can to gain weight for winter.     With lowering temperatures, just before winter, fish activity is getting low.     In winter, from December to February, catfishing is possible but the fish are less active. Still, some large catfish specimens were caught in winter. River level slightly rises, and outside temperatures are pleasant.     During spring, from March to May, weather can be unpredictable but it gets warmer. Spring floods can occur. Fish are becoming more active and during this time you can catch a lot of catfish, including trophy size. Catfish spawning season is in May. There is no closed fishing season during spawn, but it can be challenging to catch them at that time.     Summer, from June to August is the best time to fish for catfish. After spawn season they start to feed aggressively and their activity is at the highest point.     River Ebro fishing is spectacular no matter the location and anywhere you go, you will have a very exciting fishing holiday.     This river is wild, water levels vary and stormy weather can occur because of its geographical position.     Best Gear and Technique for Catfishing in Spain     Before heading to the water, make sure you are well-equipped.     Some anglers have heavy-duty fishing gear, necessary for trophy size catfish, but others should consider booking a guide and renting the equipment.     Bait and lures     One of the most effective ways of catching a huge catfish is with halibut pellets.     This frequently used method is similar to fishing with boilies. Anglers hair-rig the bait, or multiple baits, on a ledger rig. The only difference is the gear. Bigger rods and catfishing reels are required.     Catfish have excellent sense of smell so try using very smelly pellets or boilies.     Excessive baiting is not allowed but keep in mind that this river is very big and wild. You will need a serious amount of bait if you want to be successful. Few kilograms per rod during one day is a quantity you will need for large catfish.     If you want an extra challenge, try fishing with spinning rod and reel and lures, especially ones that are very loud and make a lot of vibrations. Catfish are very sensitive to vibration and correctly presented lure will seem like a prey. They should be casted in strong currents.     Rod and reel     When it comes to rods and reels, rule is the bigger the better.     Strong and powerful rods should be combined with big pit reels with free spools. Main lines should be 500 meters long and 0,4 millimetres in diameter.     As the river currents are strong, leads should weigh at least 250 grams.     Shock leaders are mandatory because the river bottom is full of mussels that cut the lines. It should be about 5 metres long and 0,6 millimetres in diameter.     Catch and Release fishing on river Ebro     There are two main reasons why catfish are growing huge in Ebro river.     One of them is geographical; average water temperatures are higher than in rivers where we usually find catfish. That means they can feed trough the year, without long winter break. Catfish are not native to Ebro river. They were introduced more than 30 years ago.     Other reason is Catch and Release fishing. Anglers catch huge specimens, take a picture and release them back into the water. Those specimens can spawn and produce new fish who are likely to inherent the size.     Also, releasing huge fish is good for tourist business.     Tips and Tricks for Ebro river fishing     No one knows every tiny detail about river Ebro fishing, but here are some tips for first-timers visiting this extraordinary location.     Catfish behaviour     Catfish are keeping close to each other, and they can travel long distance searching for food.     Some anglers wrongly think they are lazy and spend time in the same hole all the time. Mullet fish is their favourite food and mullets live in the lower 30 miles of Ebro river. Some places can be completely vast, and in another abundance of catfish appear. They are attracted to stream inlets, slacks and sewer outfalls. Catfish will feed aggressively in those locations, especially in the afternoon.     Catfish location regarding to river flow     Avoid middle part of the river. Water is cooler due to strong currents and greater depths. Try to find a line where fast river flow meets margin slack.     Night Fishing     Try to find a location where night fishing is legal.     Most of the river Ebro fishing takes place during the day. One reason is that in some parts night fishing is forbidden. Other reason is that tourists who are paying day trips fish during the day.     Catfish are very active during night and because less anglers present their baits at that time, your chances become higher.     Fishing companion     This may seem a bit silly, but if it is your first time trying to catch a trophy size catfish, you should think about handling that enormous catch. That is not the same as a few kilograms fish on a local pond.     If there is a chance you will catch something too large to handle by yourself, make sure you have a helper. It would be a shame to lose a catch of a lifetime!     Best time to fish for catfish     Don't forget about that - some times and seasons are better than other for catfishing.     In order to find out what is the best time to fish for catfish, keep watching the video and improve your chances to catch a big one!     Rules and regulations for catfishing on river Ebro     Rules and regulations for river Ebro fishing, depending on location, are under two regulatory bodies.     One is Catalonia, and other one is Aragon.     Both are able to issue a fishing permit, which is mandatory for every angler.     Having a valid licence is mandatory, same as having a fishing ticket. Licences can be obtained online and day tickets are sold in various places near the river.     If fishing from a boat near to Catalonia-Aragon border, it can be hard to determine which licence and day ticket anglers need.     In Aragon, fishing is permitted from sunrise until 10 PM, while in Catalonia anglers can fish 24 hours a day.     Catalonian and Aragon licences have some differences, and you should familiarise yourself with both.     Some of the most important rules are the following:     \u2022 Using live bat is not allowed. \u2022 Sardines are the only allowed dead fish baits. \u2022 Fishing nets are not allowed, same as keeping live fish in them. \u2022 Excessive prebaiting is forbidden. \u2022 Every angler can have up to two fishing rods.     While catfishing in Spain, make sure you obey all the rules and regulations.     Conclusion     Catfishing in Spain, on Ebro river, is one of the most exciting fishing experience anglers can have.     Wide choice of fishing locations provides endless possibilities for everyone\u2019s taste. Enormous wels catfish, especially in the lower river parts are real fighters on the hook.     Dozens of nearby towns and villages offer accommodation options for multiple day fishing. Life around the river is organised in a way that fishing is always within a reach.     River Ebro fishing requires skill, experience and strong equipment. For less experienced anglers, numerous agencies offer single or multiple day fishing trips, together with equipment or boat rental.     Make sure you obey the rules and regulations and enjoy fishing trip od a lifetime!

      "text":" Gran Paradiso\u2014the great paradise among ibex and marmots     Literally. We found ourselves in the middle of those mighty mountains completely unexpectedly. We were considering going on holiday the last week of July and the first week of August (a few years back, though) and due to forecasts of heavy rain we changed the initially planned direction towards the Dolomites at the last minute, basically right before leaving home, and decided to go \"a bit\" further, to Gran Paradiso. We knew that the park was wonderful, the many photos we\u2019d seen of it had been encouraging us to visit it for a long time, and so the decision wasn\u2019t even that surprising.     The goal wasn\u2019t as much mountaineering in the sense of conquering the highest peaks, but more of the \u201cwandering and photographing\u201d sort as I like to say: with plenty of walking around hills and valleys and a good amount of taking photos and of course intensely experiencing the beautiful nature.     And we had all of the above in abundance. We set up our tent in the camp and then discovered hairpin bends, first by car that occasionally made some puffing noises, and then on foot. The mighty summits reigned over by ibex were inviting. The Gran Paradiso National Park is not known only for its mighty peak of the same name reaching 4061 metres but also for ibex. Gran Paradiso is also where the ibex living in our Julian Alps originate; they were brought to the valley of Zadnjica after 1965. Sharp verticals, patches of colourful soft pillows of mountain flowers and herbs. Somewhere in between, the wind brings along the calls of eagles, marmots and ibex.     \u201cIt really is paradise-like,\u201d Stane and I quietly exclaimed to ourselves and out loud. You know how it is, sharing a pleasant experience with our loved ones multiplies it at least a thousand fold. This was also true in this case. Invisible threads were weaving together earthly reality and imaginary world \u2026 Indeed, the mountains are precisely that holy place where time and time again legends are born about gods and heroes, mythical creatures, and along with them those about the creation and the end of the world. They emerge from unspoiled nature, inaccessibility or difficult access to this wild world and from the awe of humans who use their imagination to depict this special bond and feelings using the language of various arts too.     A thought by Roland Dellagiacoma comes to mind: \u201cHigh mountains always reminded me that high above them or deep inside of them, above the highest peak and under the lowest chasm, anywhere and everywhere, lies a big secret: the limit of what is allowed, the limit of our capabilities and the limit of the last realization.\u201d     My heart nods. How could it not, next to this magnificent kingdom of the mountain world.     We did have some luck with ibex, but the big ones prefer staying higher up during the summer, whereas another type of sound can be heard much beyond the tree line but in the grassier areas of the park. You\u2019re on the lookout for them and then you see, appearing from out of the grass in front of you, a furry head curiously observing the surroundings of its burrow. No, these aren\u2019t bears, even though they too like sleeping through the winter. Of course, we\u2019re talking about marmots. However, these ones are not wrapping Milka chocolate.     Sometimes they casually rest in front of their burrows, but in reality they are alert and notice every little rustle near or far. And when they sense danger, they immediately stand up on hind legs, raise their head high up in the air and warn their entire nearby community with shrill whistles. Soon after, others do the same and hide inside their burrows until the danger passes.     We zigzagged among marmots, mountains, waterfalls, peaks and ibex for a bit more than a fortnight. Not long enough to see all the views and do all the walking, but the impressions are strong enough and so we\u2019re already picking dates for returning in autumn. Perhaps we should take a peek from the French side as well, climb to reach other views or refresh ourselves by looking at lovely lakes, but also feel the vibe of the mountain wilderness during a slightly less touristy season. Until next time.     Petra Dra\u0161kovi\u010d Pelc     Born in the Slovene \u0160tajerska, she chose to live in Ko\u010devje and the mere thought of adventures in the wild nature of Alaska gets her heart racing like a wild animal. She enjoys silence, peace and the beauty of the light-flooded wilds of all the untouched corners of the world, as well as the beauty of her local Ko\u010devje-area and Slovenia. She is an enthusiastic traveler, a curious admirer of nature, a tourist guide, author of countless articles in Slovenia as well as abroad and a doctor in biomedical science, who found her calling in (natural scientific) photography. Throughout her work with ARS NATURAE she tries to express love towards nature and its preservation. "

Evaluation procedure     The evaluation procedure is conducted by the Temporary expert body(hereinafter: TEB) appointed by the Scientific Council of the Agency (hereinafter: SCA). The SCA shall adopt the decision on appointing the Chairperson, the Deputy Chairperson and members of the TEB, setting out their duties and duration of the term. Composition of the TEB shall cover all scientific disciplines whose applications are submitted. TEB is composed of members of the Scientific Council of the Disciplines and Slovenian reviewers of the ERC projects within Horizon 2020, namely one of them for each scientific discipline.     Members of the TEB shall appoint two reviewers for each application submitted, taking into account the content of individual application. The reviewers are selected from the list of the foreign experts run by the agency, from the list of the Slovenian reviewers of the ERC projects within Horizon 2020, and as well from the list of members of the Scientific Council of the Disciplines. When selecting reviewers, priority shall be given to the foreign reviewers.     Every application is assessed by two reviewers, whereby one of the two is the reviewer \u2013 rapporteur. Reviewers evaluate individual elements of assessment by completing the evaluation form which contains a numerical and descriptive assessment of individual criterions \u2013 an individual report. After consulting the other reviewer, the reviewer \u2013 rapporteur prepares in a systematic and orderly manner the combined work report with an overall assessment for each criterion. The coordinated report is signed by both reviewers.     Members of the TEB shall then review the received reviewer\u2019s reports. In the event of a significant number of applications reaching the threshold for inclusion into the draft list of projects, and thereby exceeding the available funds for co-financing, an integral part of the evaluation process shall be an oral hearing (interview). The oral hearing is intended only for those applications whose total score is equal to the lower marginal threshold, which in the present case is determined by the funds available and by the principle of inclusion of all scientific disciplines whose applications are submitted. The oral hearing shall be assessed by at least two members of the TEB, whereby one of the members of the TEB ought to be from the scientific field of application submitted. The presentation is evaluated with an assessment from 0 to 5, whereby the quality of the application, academic age of the researcher and his\/her prospects for success in the future ERC call shall be considered. The evaluation of the hearing is complementary to the overall assessment.     At the end of the evaluation procedure the TEB shall prepare a final evaluation of the applications and the financially evaluated priority list of applications, taking into account the principle of representation of all scientific disciplines in such a way that at least one positively assessed application for each discipline is included in the priority list. Ranking list of all other applications shall be carried out on the grounds of the overall assessment. The draft priority list of applications for co-financing is then submitted for discussion to the SCA. The decision on the selection of applications for (co)financing is adopted by director of the agency upon the proposal from the SCA.     8. Assessment criteria     The detailed evaluation elements applying to the excellence of the research project are set out below.     a) In terms of research project quality criterion and in line with Article 99 of the Rules, the following indicators shall be considered:     To what extent does the proposed research address important challenges?     To what extent are the objectives ambitious and beyond the state of the art (e.g. novel concepts and approaches or development across disciplines)?     To what extent is the concept sound and the proposed timescales and resources necessary and properly justified (based on the outline of a scientific research project)?     To what extent is the proposed research methodology appropriate to achieve the goals of the project (based on the outline of a scientific research project)?     b) In terms of researcher scientific quality and in line with Article 99 of the Rules, the following indicators shall be considered:     To what extent have the achievements of the researcher typically gone beyond the state-of-the-art?     To what extent does the researcher provide evidence of creative independent thinking?     To what extent has the researcher demonstrated the ability to propose and conduct ground-breaking research?     c) Partnership quality is assessed against the Application form and the Letter of support of the ERC Principal Investigator, as follows from paragraph 6.e., whereby the following shall be taken into consideration:     To what extent does the proposed research project correspond with the ongoing research project of the ERC Principal Investigator?     To what extent is the proposed plan for an active inclusion of the Visiting researcher into the ongoing project of ERC Principal Investigator well-defined and feasible?     To what extent is the relevant research infrastructure available to the Visiting researcher?     Each criterion is assessed on a scale from 0 to 5 in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 33 of the Rules. For admission to the selection for the co-financing application must reach the threshold of three points for each criterion and 10 points in total. In the event that the application fails to achieve the threshold, it will be rejected.     9.

EngD thesis.     Abstract     Nowadays, a lot of documents in healthcare are still hard copies, which cause many issues during use. There are cases in which software solutions are used, but general issues with sharing those documents and data still occur. Slovenian national project e-Health with interoperable spine tries to resolve those issues. In this thesis, one learns about OpenEHR specification, which is the base for architectural development of interoperable spine and for the Think!Ehr PlatformTM. Introduction includes the mentioned platform and application Think!Clinical, which implements archetypically connected entry forms regarding patient observation, saving data, which was entered with those forms, and uses the collected data for a simple analysis of the patient\u2019s state based on the body mass index, which is of great help to doctors in the Pediatric Clinic of Ljubljana University Medical Centre. For easier work, tools such as \u201cform builder\u201d and \u201cform renderer\u201d were used. In the development process, it can be noticed how quick one can embed a simple entry form in such a large healthcare application. It has come to knowledge, how important it is to make software products as broad as possible, so they can be used in combination with different software and hardware. This feature applies mostly to clear API-s on Think!Ehr PlatformTM and \u201cform renderer\u201d as well as to our implementation of forms, which now works in the desktop and also web application Think!Clinical.     Item Type:     Thesis (EngD thesis)     Keywords:     e-Health, OpenEHR, Think!Clinical, Think!Ehr PlatformTM, archetype, template, entry form, clinical data "

Dr. Irena Marinko: INTERCULTURAL COMPETENCIES FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION     Abstract     World, its economy, government and the majority of other sectors are getting more and more internationalized.     This means increased communication, sharing of information and experiences among different areas. The economy and government have become intertwined and co-dependent although there are many cultural differences and barriers especially in Europe with its different languages and histories of individual nations and tradition. The article Intercultural Competences for Public Administration intends to describe the increasing international activities of the public administration in Slovenia, and suggest new courses needed for international education of civil servants. The findings of the research indicate that employees in public administration should be acquainted with courses like characteristics and business behaviour of different European countries, international communication, creative business writing, relaxed conversation in a foreign language, international business, sustainable management, etc. Such courses can help students acquire the necessary skills for work in the period of globalization and increase cooperation among European nations.     Key words: Public administration, tertiary education, intercultural competencies     Introduction     The article Intercultural Competences for Public Administration intends to describe the increasing international activities of the public administration in Slovenia, and suggest new courses and themes needed for international education of civil servants.     The Republic of Slovenia has always been in close contact with other nations. In the last centuries Slovenia was under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, under France, during the Second World War it was divided between Germany, Italy and Hungary and in the 19th century a part of the ex-Yugoslavia. Slovenia became independent in 1991 and joined the European Union in 2004.     The rate of internationalization of the Slovene economy, measured by the average export and import share of GDP was up to 2009 relatively high. Slovene business companies have had plans to further increase export and import activities but the financial crisis stopped the growth in 2010. The most frequently used international operations in Slovenia are importing, direct exports, export through an intermediary and contracts (Ruzzier, Antoncic, Hisrich, 2007), sole venture direct investments, while there are not so many licensing, joint venture direct investments and franchising. Slovene SMEs make on average between 20% and 30% of their sales from international operations and sell about one-quarter of their products or services to foreign markets. Companies and employees are more or less efficient in doing this, but on average the employees of Slovene SMEs dedicate less than 25% of their time to international operations.     However, economy with its export, import and other activities represents only one part of international processes taking place in Slovenia. No detailed analysis has been made about the internationalization of public administration so far but it is obvious that almost all public administration institutions are in one or another way involved in the processes of internationalization.     President of the Republic of Slovenia with his staff, Office of the Prime Minister, different ministries (especially Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Public Administration, Ministry of Finance) as well as governmental offices (Government Office for Development and European Affairs, Office for Local Self-Government and Regional Policy, Government Office for Slovenians Abroad, Government Communication Office, Protocol of the Republic of Slovenia, Office for National Minorities) cooperate in numerous international projects, arrangements, and economic activities. They exchange visits and share experiences, cooperate with foreign firms in Slovenia and help Slovene firms abroad, try to motivate more extensive import, export, cultural and other exchanges. People employed in the contemporary public administration have to study and bring into Slovenia foreign experiences. Quite a number of public servants take part in the creation of EU policies, contribute to the promotion of Slovenia in EU member states and other target countries, publish information about Slovenia, and participate in international conferences. Also Slovene communes started to develop international links. Some cooperate in European projects, make closer contacts with foreign communes because they cooperate in the field of economy, send their representatives abroad to study development of one or another economic activity.     In the last years there have been several reports in the newspapers about how local and state administrations adapt successful foreign practices and other organizations of social infrastructure. Tax Administration of the Republic of Slovenia found a useful tax practice in Netherlands and will try to adapt it to Slovenia. Slovene local administrations think about increasing international connections with the neighbouring countries and try to contribute to sustainable development by cooperation in European programmes etc. (Bertoncelj Popit, 2010).     These tendencies of internationalization show that economy with its import and export activities is no more the only sector that has to do with internationalization. In fact, it is a question where there is more internationalization, in public administration and\/or government or in business firms. Therefore we should not speak only about international business or international economic activities but also \u2013 or perhaps even more \u2013 about international public administration activities and about the necessity to introduce new intercultural competencies also in the education of civil servants and not only in business.     The paper first describes the international activities in Slovene public administration and tasks of the employees, quotes a literature review on intercultural competencies, and lists suggestions for new necessary courses and themes that will acquaint students with intercultural competencies.     The findings of the research will help to answer the questions:     - Is public administration getting so internationalized that employees should be acquainted with intercultural competences?     - Which courses should be introduced in BA programmes of the future civil servants to develop their intercultural competencies?     International Activities in Slovene Government and\/or Public Administration     This chapter gives a short summary of international activities that take place in Slovene public administration daily as it can be seen on the web pages of the government, in newspapers and on TV.     The National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia cooperates with international parliamentary institutions and international organizations, has its delegations in international parliamentary institutions, cooperates with other parliaments through parliamentary friendship groups, its members participate in international conferences, receive foreign representatives to discuss matters of common interest, visit foreign countries to learn foreign experiences etc. (Republic of Slovenia, National Assembly, 2011).     Slovene president and his staff are strongly involved in international activities because the President receives all the most important foreign visitors, participates in the international meetings, addresses international conferences, visits foreign countries, gives interviews. Similarly, the Prime Minister accepts many foreign guests and performs visits abroad.     Slovenia\u2019s presidency of the Council of the European Union, Regional partnership, Chairmanship of the Council of Europe etc. extended international activities of Slovene public administration.     Slovenia participates in a number of international organizations: European Public Administration Network, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Network of School of Public Administration in Central and Eastern Europe, and in several fields of e-government (Slovenia, 2011).     Among the most internationalized parts of Slovene public administration is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs especially because of the following areas of work:     - Preparation and formulation of positions, work within international organizations, conventions, forums and bilateral joint committees etc.     - Assistance in arranging international visits and events     - Coordination in preparing positions, responses and statements in legislative procedures     - Cooperation between the Ministry and Slovenia\u2019s Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels     - Participation in preparing materials for Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Councils for the Slovenian Transport Minister     Monitoring of project implementation co-financed by the EU.     Also other ministries are going international, e.g. Slovene Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning (the presidency of the Alpine Convention), Slovene Ministry of Culture (elaboration of proposals of cultural policy measures, promotion of Slovenian culture and achievements of Slovene artists on international level), Slovene Ministry of Health (international meetings, e.g. within the framework of Eurotransplant International Foundation).     Even Slovene communes in spite of being local administrative units are increasing their international work. Communes situated in the vicinity of the border have partnerships with similar administrative institutions across the border, cooperate in common projects, exchange visits, share knowledge and experiences and acquire new knowledge. Some communes founded centers for international cooperation in EU to perform research activities, international meetings, cultural exchange and participate in different working groups. A number of international competitions and other arrangements are organized in different communes (Obcina Gornja Radgona, 2011).     The internationalization means searching data bases, agents, representatives, sending off brochures and information to prospects, discussing possible representation, corresponding in English and other foreign languages, arranging for legal registration abroad, talking to local accounting and consulting firms. In an international area it is necessary to communicate by e-mail, mobile phones, text-messaging, video- and Web-conferencing as well as by international travel and face-to-face meetings.Employees in public administration accept and inform foreign visitors, receive, transfer, answer phone calls, accept and reply letters and e-messages, write and explain reports, analyses, articles, cooperate in public relations and different marketing activities, accept, classify, and process documents in foreign languages, have to complete and control transport, export- and import documents, design and write letters and other documents in foreign languages, enter documents in evidences, manage lists and evidences, archive documents, study foreign laws and rules, control international tenders, issue confirmations and certificates, prepare agreements, gather data about the possibility of education and training abroad, participate in EU and other projects, organize international meetings and conferences, prepare documents for meetings, organize accommodation and travel of foreign guests, organize international travel and so on.     All these tasks require in front of all a good command of at least one or preferably more foreign languages because they have to communicate both orally as well as in writing.     International activities require special sensitivity and comprehension. When making contacts with other cultures, e.g. at international trade shows, seeking for suppliers, exporters, importers, joint-venture partners, embassy officials, chambers of commerce, trade associations and consultants, one has to be prepared to overcome stereotypes, differences and prejudices. Generalizations and categories are necessary, but when they are too rigid they can be a barrier to the effective interpretation of a situation (Gibson, 2008, 12). This is especially important when discussing prices, payment terms, specifications, quality, quantity, and all the other issues involved in international business.     The most competitive Slovene companies in the future will be those that will produce and sell on international markets (Ferk, 2010). Globalization requires from management quick and continuous adaptation to foreign cultures. The same is required from management in public administration and government.     Literature survey on intercultural competencies     For a long time it was believed that internationalization will introduce a common international culture, most probably the one of Western countries but it is obvious that we are still far from universal cultural solutions (Hofstede, 2001, Jandt, 2004).     The concept of being intercultural is challenging and not always comfortable. Being intercultural involves questioning the taken-for-granted conventions within which one lives, seeking to empathise with the experience of others, reflecting on the impact of this upon oneself and one\u2019s own identities. Those who work in international area should be aware that people are uncomfortable to do business with complete strangers, especially if it seems that these have different values and habits. An intercultural approach does not mean abandoning one\u2019s own value positions but it means recognising the importance of understanding and negotiation (Alred, Byram, Fleming, 2006).     Members of one culture can, by the force of imaginative insight, understand the values, the ideals, the form of life of another culture or society, even those remote in time or space. They may find these values unacceptable, but if they open their minds sufficiently they can grasp how one might be a full human being, with whom one could communicate, and at the same time live in the light of values widely different from one\u2019s own.     Byram recommends (Alred, Byram, Fleming, 2006, 121) that employees in international organizations should be educated how to grasp and take seriously the opinions and arguments of others, recognize those who have different opinions, be able to put oneself in the position of others, accept criticism and listen. They should make their own opinions (needs, interests, feelings, values) clear, speak coherently, and explain clearly. Every kind of violence, humiliation, insult etc. should be abandoned. People should take account of those who are weaker, reduce discrimination, integrate outsiders. It is necessary to organise group work, cooperate in the distribution of work, take on tasks, trustworthiness, perseverance, care and conscientiousness. In the global world people should tolerate plurality, divergences, differences, recognise conflicts, as far as possible create balance, and resolve problems in socially acceptable ways, accept mistakes and differences, find compromises, seek consensus, accept majority decisions, tolerate minorities, promote encouragement, balance rights and responsibilities, and show trust and courage. Group responsibility, development of fair norms and common interests and needs should be emphasized and common approaches to tasks pursued.     Slovenia still falls short of these recommendations because of its strong emphasis on national identity and with little indication of any elements of education for intercultural citizenship. While large enterprises are increasingly involved in cross-border operations and have been acquainted (at least to a certain degree) with cultural differences among their and foreign countries, the globalization process presents challenges and opportunities especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the public administration. Organizations that want to do business efficiently in a global environment should take into account language, religion, values and attitudes, education, social organization, technology and material culture, the political environment, and the legal environment (Jazbec, 2007).     Himmelmann says that words and terms have a certain meaning and sense in every language (Alred, Byram, Fleming, 2006, 69). Terms are embedded in a certain culture. They emerge from that culture. They are modes of communication and ways of thinking in that culture. They symbolise certain contents and provoke certain connotations for those who are used to the words and terms in question. A model for intercultural competence proposes an integration of linguistic\/communicative objectives with intercultural competence objectives.     Of key importance in international firms is knowledge of foreign languages to a degree which enables not only basic expressions but a relaxed conversation and understanding that there are differences in the same language spoken in different countries. Language barriers, adjustments to different cultural and linguistic environment can be observed as shyness, language, social and personal uncertainties, fear of failure and communication problems. There should be information about what to do when different cultures fail to understand one another, either for language, behavioural, or cultural reasons. Foreign languages in Slovenia have long been taught under the supposition that it is most important to know grammatical rules and that one should speak without mistakes (Marinko, 2010). This contributed to serious problems in relaxed conversation and higher education institutions must engage their students and professors in critical and creative reflections and discourse and not hold onto past practices (Riznar, 2010).     Several authors recommend that employees who work in international environment should be acquainted with intercultural competences such as knowledge, tolerance, flexibility, awareness of one\u2019s own cultural identity, openness for new experiences, considering opinions, ability to adapt to values of other people, ethical behaviour, patience, interpersonal skills, empathy, sense of humour (Van Eyken et. al., 2005).     A survey of courses taught at Slovenian colleges and faculties for public administration shows that students who will become civil servants develop knowledge in the areas of law, administration, constitution, IT, economics, organization, management, EU, and on some colleges also politics, policies, international relations, history, psychology, communication, democracy, human rights, and voting system. Foreign languages are not always considered as core subjects and in the best case they represent about 5 % of pedagogical hours. Slovene BA study programmes for public administration\/political sciences do not offer enough foreign languages and lack courses in the area of intercultural cooperation. If the students do not acquire their intercultural skills through additional education, they will not be able to contribute to better understanding of differences among different nations in the globalized world.     Suggestions for new courses containing intercultural competences     The demarcation between the public and private sectors is blurred. Laws, regulations, tax policies, contracts, grants and loans require an interaction between the two sectors so that even in the private sector an understanding of public administration and government is critical (Cleveland State University, 2011).     In the past ten years a number of world\u2019s changes have contributed to significant changes of the public administration which requires new skills, attitudes and behaviour among public officials at all levels. The core competencies for the public sector in the 21st century differ in many ways from the past. The skills, knowledge and competencies are increasing and becoming more complex (United Nations, 2005).     To ensure compliance with the normative framework, reduce the level of conflict, guarantee peaceful co-existence, make contemporary government and\/or public administration into an example of dialogue between cultures, the employees in public administration should be acquainted with some basic intercultural competences.     Foreign languages are among the most important intercultural competencies. Foreign languages express different cultures and give the possibility to understand different cultures. Students who speak more foreign languages can communicate with several countries. Knowledge of foreign languages opens the door to other cultures and can improve intercultural understanding in Europe and with the rest of the world. Different documents of the EU emphasize the importance of languages and there are many actions and projects that support knowledge of foreign languages. Therefore the first condition of the new study programmes for government\/public administration is knowledge of foreign languages. Foreign languages should be taught at least to the level B 2 CEF.     There should be more courses\/themes on European citizenship and participations; students should expand the world view through understanding and respect of different cultures and with other contemporary aspects of intercultural communication and international cooperation. The courses should help acquire knowledge about characteristics and habits of different European countries, international communication, different beliefs, practices, rituals, ceremonies of particular groups of people, sustainable management etc. The study programmes should include courses\/themes on behaviour, values, communication style, conflict-solving-techniques etc.     Public administration should also be acquainted with ethnic minorities in their countries. Cities are environments where immigrants are confronted with discrimination and racism (Sprung, 2004).     There are some university programmes that already contain suitable courses which acquaint students with intercultural competencies and these should be included in public administration studies:     Ethics in public administration     Cross-cultural and ethical dimensions of international management     International relations in international communities     Managing in the international arena     International protection of minorities etc.     Conclusions     Slovene leading economists, governmental and educational institutions are convincing business firms and other organizations that they should increase their international contacts and enlarge their possibilities in the global world. In the future we can expect much more export, import, joint-ventures, global marketing etc. which means communication with most different cultures in different languages. However, not only business but also government and\/or public administration are going international. The most different services and bodies from the President of the Republic of Slovenia to the communes exchange visits and share experiences, cooperate in international projects and agreements, participate in international conferences and intend to increase international contacts. Therefore it is necessary that also future civil servants develop their knowledge of one or more foreign languages and that they are acquainted with intercultural competencies such as tolerance, flexibility, awareness of one\u2019s own cultural identity, openness for new experiences, considering opinions, ability to adapt to values of other people, ethical behaviour, patience, interpersonal skills, empathy and so on.     Our study programmes which educate students for work in the public administration and\/or government should offer more foreign languages and courses which would develop intercultural competencies. The paper lists some courses that should be included in the curriculums of future civil servants. However, it will be necessary to create also more new courses and thus contribute to intercultural knowledge. "

Ampak ko se je nekaj zganilo v tebi in se oglasilo.Ko je tvoj sr\u010dni utrip dal ritem dejanjem.Ko si bil eno s tistim kar je drhtelo v tebi, takrat si bil zvest.\u201dAndre Bjerke     ITI Slovenija     Skupna izjava evropskih filmskih organizacij     European organizations support Slovenian film community facing disastrous governmental pressure as public film funding is blocked     Our organisations, representing authors, screenwriters, directors, actors, crew, producers and members of the film community across Europe, join in support of the Slovenian Federation of Filmmakers\u2019 Guilds against the effective shutdown of its national industry, following administrative changes that have allowed the Slovenian government to choke the financing of Slovenian film production at a time when the sector is experiencing its worst crisis since World War II.     In the words of our Slovenian colleagues: \u201cThe severity of the situation we\u2019ve been facing during the past eight months has become so dramatic that the survival of the entire ecosystem of the Slovenian film and audiovisual industry is now seriously jeopardized.\u201d     Since May 2020, the Slovenian Film Centre, a public agency of the Republic of Slovenia, has been experiencing dire administrative difficulties in allocating financial support to film projects that are required to get government approval at the highest level. This resulted in the effective shutdown of the vast majority of the film production planned for 2020, while most of pre- production and production for the next couple of years are put on hold.     As a consequence, most of freelance filmmakers, film professionals, actors and independent film producers have not been paid for work completed since November 2019 and are facing very grim mid-term unemployment and poverty prospects drastically increased by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.     It is worth mentioning that since the inception of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Slovenian government has failed to make any specific relief funds or programmes available to protect its audiovisual industry as this unprecedented crisis unfolds.     Freedom of artistic expression requires artists and the cultural sector at large to be independent and free of any governmental censorship, political interference or pressures.     Could the lengthy governmental-driven administrative delays in this calamitous context, coupled with the inability of Slovenian authorities to resolve a situation that has immediate dramatic consequences on the livelihoods and survival of our colleagues in Slovenia, on the survival of independent local audiovisual creation and the bilateral and multilateral relationships with co-producing countries in the mid-term, truly be a coincidence?     We call on European and Slovenian decision-makers to urgently resolve this catastrophic situation by rekindling the dialogue with the local audiovisual industry stakeholders, carefully considering its immediate economic and cultural consequences. We will remain particularly attentive to the evolution of the situation as Slovenia stands to take over the presidency of the Council of the European Union in July 2021.

      "text":" Press Releases     Achievements of the Slovenian Presidency of the EU Council     I. Programme and priorities     1. Future of Europe enforcement of the Lisbon Treaty     By signing the Lisbon Treaty in December 2007, the EU Member States committed to ratifying it at the earliest possible date. This aim was achieved by 19 Member States, while ratification procedures are under way in the remaining countries. Slovenia ratified the Treaty as the second Member State on 29 January 2008.     This success was slightly overshadowed by the negative result of the referendum in Ireland. Nevertheless, the European Union remains committed to its goals. The Member States agree that the ratification procedures must continue. At the same time, we will cooperate with Ireland in trying to find a uniform solution acceptable to all Member States and enabling the further development of the Union in the shortest possible time.     With a view to the Treaty's entry into force as of 1 January 2009, Slovenia conducted the preparatory work for the beginning of implementation. On the basis of informal consultations on several open issues, the Presidency issued a report on the work completed.     2. Successful launch of the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy     At the spring meeting of the European Council 2008, we successfully launched the second three-year period of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for 2008-2010. It was agreed that, while radical changes in the content were not necessary, the process should be carried forward, with a focus on implementation of reforms. Especially successful was the compromise of the Member States regarding the necessity to continue the reform process after 2010.     The Slovenian Presidency made its mark especially in the following areas:     The field of knowledge and innovation was given new impetus by the introduction of the fifth freedom free movement of knowledge and the Ljubljana Process. The aim is to establish closer cooperation among participants in the European Research Area. A significant contribution to this will be made by the European Institution of Innovation and Technology, which was agreed to have its seat in Budapest. Another important contribution to the high-technology development of the EU was the agreement on implementation of the Galileo European satellite radio navigation programme. In addition, important conclusions regarding the promotion of creativity and innovation through education, family-friendly scientific careers, and the role of culture and creativity in the Lisbon Strategy were adopted.     In the area of increasing the competitiveness of undertakings, we focused especially on the stimulation of rapid growth of small and medium-sized enterprises and measures for the reduction of administrative burdens (important adoption of the Goods Package and launch of the Eurostars programme).     In our efforts to reduce administrative burdens we reconfirmed the commitment to continue the Better Regulation Initiative (-25% by 2012).     Much attention was also devoted to strengthening the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy. We undertook the commitment to gradual implementation of the agreed common principles of flexicurity as one of the appropriate approaches to facing the challenges of the 21st century, such as demographic change, accelerated technological advancement and globalisation. Our main focus was the improvement of the situation of young people; we also contributed to the European discussion on demographic challenges and to adoption of measures in the area of gender equality.     3. A step forward in tackling climate and energy issues     As regards the climate and energy package issued by the European Commission in January 2008, we achieved all set goals. At the spring meeting of the European Council, we adopted the key political decisions prerequisite for its timely adoption: commitment to political agreement among the Member States by the end of 2008 and agreement regarding fundamental principles for burden sharing. In the course of comprehensive and intense further discussions, important progress was made in the understanding of proposed solutions and unification of the Member States' positions. Informal meetings with the European Parliament took place as well.     Only by timely adoption of this legislative package will the EU be able to play its leading role and make a credible appearance in international negotiations for the conclusion of a comprehensive global agreement on climate change for the period after 2012 that will take place in December 2009 in Copenhagen. Efforts for the timely conclusion of this agreement were discussed in all meetings with third countries, while important agreements, expected to contribute to more unity in the approach to the fight against climate change, were achieved at the EU-Japan and EU-LAC summits.     The greatest success of the Presidency in the energy field was the agreement on the third legislative package for the liberalisation of the electricity and gas internal market. After the presentation of a compromise proposal, we succeeded in bringing the positions of the 27 Member States closer and to reach a broad consensus on the key elements of all five legislative proposals for both electricity and gas.     4. Confirmation of the European perspective of the Western Balkans and the European Neighbourhood Policy     During the Slovenian Presidency, the network of Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the Western Balkan countries was completed. Agreements were signed with Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This network of agreements contributes to strengthening and speeding up the EU integration process of the Western Balkan countries, and consequently to reinforcing the stability and overall development of the region.     Another important achievement comprises sectoral initiatives, i. e. specific initiatives in the area of regional cooperation and economic development:     dialogue on visa liberalisation was launched with all the countries of the Western Balkans;     a mandate to open negotiations on a transport agreement was conferred on the European Commission;     establishment of a Western Balkan Investment Framework was agreed upon;     enhanced cooperation was established between the region and the EU in the area of civil protection;     an initiative to transfer the EU methodology and to prepare a South Eastern European Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SEE OCTA) and an initiative to transfer recommendations in the area of the fight against terrorism to the Western Balkan countries were introduced.     After Kosovo's declaration of independence, the commitment to pursue stability in the region and to ensure the presence of the EU in Kosovo, through the EULEX mission and the EU Special Representative, was confirmed. We succeeded to maintain unity in all major issues and prevent destabilisation of the region. On 11 July 2008, the European Commission will organise a Donors Conference for the region, with emphasis on Kosovo.     Accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey continued. In the accession negotiations with Croatia, the Slovenian Presidency opened four chapters, and two chapters with Turkey.     A major achievement within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was the launch of the Black Sea Synergy initiative setting forth the policy guidelines for joint activities in the region. It is expected that the Mediterranean and Eastern dimensions of the European Neighbourhood Policy will be further reinforced in a balanced manner through the French initiative of the \"Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean\" and the Polish-Swedish Eastern Partnership initiative.     5. Promoting dialogue of cultures, beliefs and traditions in the framework of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue     The Slovenian Presidency started with an opening event dedicated to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue in Ljubljana. It was followed by numerous discussions and events. For the purposes of strengthening intercultural dialogue, a number of initiatives were adopted in the fields of the cultural dimension inclusion in EU external relations, youth, education, multilingualism, and culture. A special Slovenian contribution to strengthening partnership and dialogue was the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean University with its seat in Piran in June 2008.     II. Main legislative achievements     A significant breakthrough was achieved in adopting two labour law acts which had been under negotiation for many years. The Directive on working time and the Directive regulating the working conditions of temporary workers are of key importance for European workers since they regulate the working time and the rights of temporary agency workers.     In co-decision procedure with the European Parliament, the Regulation on the implementation of the Galileo European satellite radio navigation system was adopted. Through this adoption, new momentum was given to the project, thus ensuring that quality satellite navigation services will be available to all European citizens and companies by 2013.     As regards environmental protection, four key instruments were approved in the co-decision procedure with the European Parliament: the Directive on waste, which introduces better waste management, the Regulation on mercury and the Directive on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy, which both govern safer management of hazardous substances, as well as the Directive on inclusion of aviation activities in the emissions trading scheme, representing one of the major actions for overall reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Apart from that, the Directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law was adopted, defining acts against environment having devastating effects on human health and the environment as severe criminal acts.     In co-decision procedure with the European Parliament, a number of important documents were adopted, contributing to the strengthening of the internal market: the Goods Package, the Decision on mobile satellite services, the Directive on postal services, a new Customs Code and the Regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. The Directive on credit agreements for consumers will contribute to a higher level of consumer protection.     In the field of home affairs, we managed to bring to an end a more than three-year process of demanding negotiations in the Council and to reach an agreement regarding the Directive on common standards and procedures in the Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals. After intense negotiations, we also succeeded to negotiate a political agreement on transforming Europol into an EU agency.     In the field of justice, negotiations with the European Parliament concerning the Directive on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters were concluded, while within the Council itself an agreement on the enforcement of judgements rendered in absentia was achieved.     III. EU-third country summits     During the Presidency, four EU-third country summits were held: EU-Japan, EU-LAC, EU-USA, and EU-Russian Federation. They were aimed at strengthening the strategic dimension of relations and partnerships between the EU and third countries and at the same time provided an opportunity to discuss current global, regional, economic, security and other issues, including climate change and energy.     An important further achievement was the confirmation of the mandate to open negotiations on a new agreement between the EU and Russia, which will replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.     IV. Presidency's response to unexpected events     An integral part of holding the Presidency consists of events that cannot be anticipated; therefore it is not possible to get prepared for them in advance. The Slovenian Presidency reacted to all unexpected events without delay and in a well considered manner. The March European Council responded to turbulences in financial markets. Three comprehensive and detailed timetables for measures in various areas of financial market regulation and supervision were updated. A Memorandum of Understanding on cross-border cooperation in the field of financial stability was signed and took effect.     The June European Council responded to the consequences of high food prices. The Heads of State and Government agreed that an urgent response of the EU was necessary, not only with a focus on the poorest sectors of the EU population, but also on the global level. Globally, the EU will strive to eliminate the consequences of the rise in food prices for poorer population within the UNO and G8 Group. In this context, attention was paid to framing bio fuel policy and to enhancing the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals.     The Presidency responded to the events in Kenya and Chad, riots in Tibet, the earthquake in China, and the cyclone in Burma\/Myanmar. "

On clear days, the observation platform offers a view stretching from the Alps to the Adriatic Sea. After viewing the throne of Boroevi\u0107, a monumental piece dedicated to the Austrian-Hungarian commander who masterminded the unexpected defeat of the Italian army in what came to be dubbed the Miracle of Kobarid (12th Isonzo Battle), we will visit the mysterious underground world of Pe\u010dinka Cave. Option to take photos with soldiers in WW1 army garb, and getting a glimpse into the harsh reality of being a frontline soldier. We finish with a army-style pot meal (merenda), fresh from the cauldron over the open fire. The return to the Peace Memorial is also a return back to the present.

Odre\u017ei vrhnji del \u010dajne vre\u010dke in jo izprazni. 2. Nato iz papirja izre\u017ei majhen pravokoten del, ki ustreza \u0161irini in dol\u017eini zatrganine nohta. 3.

Po\u010dakaj, da se lak popolnoma posu\u0161i, nato pa s pilico pri strani zgladi odve\u010dni papir, da bo rob nohta gladek. 6.

Celoten izdelek je na voljo na njihovi bandcamp strani, kjer si zadevo pred nakupom v celoti lahko poslu\u0161ate.     Svoje spomine bo v obliki knjige zbral in izdal eden prominentnih akterjev metal scene, Jon Zazula, ustanovitelj zalo\u017ebe Megaforce in \u010dlovek, ki je izstrelil Metallico, Anthrax itd.     Zazula je za Metal Voice rekel, da je knjiga gotova in da naj bi iz\u0161la oktobra letos: \"The book is coming out in October \u2014 I hope; I hope by Halloween of this year. It is finished. We're just filling in a few little parts. I'm trying to finish my thank-you list, which is already four chapters long.     The book starts where most people wanted to end the book, at the Roseland Ballroom [in New York City in August 1984], when ANTHRAX, METALLICA and RAVEN played and all three bands got signed to major labels that night. They thought that's where the pinnacle of the story lies. But, to tell you the truth, the book opens up on that and goes from there. So it really starts you with the madness of the Roseland Ballroom, and it goes from the Roseland Ballroom to today.\"     Seveda je ni napisal sam: \"I brought in a fellow named Harold Claros[-Maldonado], who researched my life, in and out, and laid it all out for me. We both, after chapter five or six, looked at each other and said, 'All that happened in a year and a half? All that happened in two years?' I mean, we went from total obscurity in a flea market, making fifty dollars a night, to, at one point, being worth over 10 million dollars.\"     \"It's a great story, and it's a great story about a husband and a wife, how they worked together through thick and thin. And the book talks about the problems and how we started with not a dime. We didn't have a pot to piss in; [we were] living in the hall for years. It's a very interesting story, if I must say so myself. And it's a blue-collar story. It's not about somebody who was born with a silver spoon and had to make it. We really had to bust our asses. I pushed garments in the garment district when I was a kid and boxes on my back to shippers. That's the guy. And the wife he met, and together they made something. And that's what this book's gonna be about.\"     Medtem ko Mustaine & Co. ustvarjajo novo plo\u0161\u010do, je v pripravi tudi nova kompilacija, Warheads On Foreheads. Z njo proslavljajo 35 let obstoja, temu primerno pa na 3 CD-jih ali 4 LP-jih ponuja 35 komadov iz celotne kariere. Iz\u0161la bo 22. marca prek UMe Recordings.     Dave Mustaine pravi: \"Thirty-five years ago I chose the name MEGADETH for my band and I see these songs as the most efficient weapons in the band's arsenal. Warheads On Foreheads' is a U.S. military term for targeting efficiency. It's all about using the right tool for the job and these tracks were created for maximum destruction (or stopping power, or something else!).\"     Death metalci Malevolent Creation, ki so 18. januarja izdali album The 13th Beast, zdaj ponujajo spot za komad Release The Soul.

Norve\u0161ki deathmetalski te\u017ekokategorniki Blood Red Throne so na\u0161li dom pri zalo\u017ebi Mighty Music, kjer bodo spomladi izdali novo plato.     Zalo\u017eba pravi: \"We've been following BLOOD RED THRONEas fans since their 'Monument Of Death' debut album in 2001, and have always been fans of their crunchy, technically pinched, full-on death metal. They've been carrying the [death metal] flame in Scandinavia throughout all the black metal several waves. When the opportunity came to work with them, there was no room for second thoughts.\"     Bend dodaja: \"2018 was a quiet year for us. Now, we start 2019 by joining forces with our Scandinavian friends in Mighty Music record label that will release our ninth album, 'Fit To Kill', this spring. We have several live shows comin' up and we're ready as fuck to take back the 'Throne.'\"     Med novimi potrditvami za 24.

Album Dreaming Neon Black bi zaradi srhljivega ozadja najbr\u017e zlahka uvrstili med najbolj presunljive plate v metalu.     2020 bo o\u010ditno leto temnega vala. Ponovno obujanje \u017eanra darkwave je v polnem zagonu, zanimivo pa je to, da pri nas \u0161e zmeraj primanjkuje tovrstnih glasbenih zasedb.     18 let organiziranja koncertov raznih oblik ekstremne glasbe ni ma\u010dji ka\u0161elj, tako da lahko na tem mestu Dirty Skunksom samo \u010destitamo.     Noctiferia so nastopili suvereno in brez pretenzije, ki spremlja mnogo sodobnega black metala. Na ta na\u010din so se takoj pribli\u017eali ob\u010dinstvu in intimno vzdu\u0161je Ostrige izkoristili sebi v prid.     Da je ve\u010dina obiskovalcev tokrat pri\u0161la zaradi Voivod, je bilo ve\u010d kot jasno in logi\u010dno, vseeno pa se marsikdo zdaj lahko pohvali, da je enkrat v \u017eivljenju dejansko videl Gwar na koncertu.

Such cases call for compromises. This case study presents how we at TECOS approach such problems quickly and cost efficiently by applying methods of advanced 3D scanning and reverse engineering.     Problematics     hand made statue used as a base for creation of sand casting pattern     several details on the spiral are not manufacturable     short lead-time     We performed the following steps for the customer:     3D scanning of hand made statues (accuracy 0,02 mm)     Reverse engineering (creation of precise computer 3D model for further processing and modifications)     Preparation of the 3D model for the technological process of sand casting     Export of 3D model in neutral format     The final result was a technological 3D model with all little details, ready to be used for pattern design and production.     Purpose and Benefits For End Customer     quickly from purchase order to final result     no need for full understanding of production technologies by the customer - all communication with technologists from selected production company was done by us     high accuracy of scanning and original details     Below you can find some pictures and more description of project phases.     3D scanning     Two statues made of plaster were scanned.     Figure 1: Original statues     ATOS CS 5M structured light scanner was used for 3D scanning with the accuracy of 0,02 mm (achieveable also under 0,01 mm). Every detail was captured including some not wanted errors which were eliminated during reverse engineering phase. Figure 2 shows scanned data (STL model).     Figure 2: Scanned data; especially the flame displays surface irregularities due to hand-work     Reverse engineering     In this phase a 3D CAD model was produced based on scanned data. CAD model is a mathematical representation of surfaces which is used as an input data for the vast majority of conventional technics of pattern or toolmaking (either for casting, injection moulding or others). In the case that larger corrections on the model are not needed this phase can even be omitted and STL is used for direct manufacturing.     Figure 3: CAD model of an athlete and flame statues; smoothing of details as comparred to figure 2 which shows only scanned data can be observed     Final Result     The customer provided a picture of trial castings made on the basis of our models which turned out very good indeed. One of them went into the hands of Peter Prevc, 2016 ski-jumping world cup champion and owner of several records. "

Optoelectronic sensor for wind speed     Quality construction: anodised aluminium, ball and Teflon bearings     Wind speed sensor DHV 39 is a rotating low-threshold digital optoelectronic sensor for measuring wind speed. It is made of naturally anodised aluminium and stainless steel. Quality sealed ball bearings and Teflon bearing are used for the rotating measuring system.     A lightweight three-cup assembly (Robinson\u2019s cross) rotates a stroboscope disc through the light beam, generated by a long-life IR diode. Interruption of the beam causes pulse output with a frequency, proportional to the wind speed. All electronic elements are protected against overvoltages by resistors and Zener diodes.     DHV 39 is connected to the measuring system by 4-pin weatherproof connector, located at the bottom of the sensor. There is also a mounting support (hole 25 mm in the diameter, 40 mm deep).     Construction of sensor requires very little maintenance. Even after years of use, when inexpensive and easily replaceable bearings are worn, sensor characteristics are almost unchanged. Normal additional mechanical load (freezing) cannot damage the sensor. Wind sensor pair (DHV 39 + DSV 39A) is usual fixed to the CRSA 39 crossarm, containing junction box and cabling.     \"We are involved with AMES d.o.o. in activities regarding meteorological and environmental measurements for many years now.

      "text":" LIFE CEPLAFIB - Implementation of a new Circular Economy through the valorisation of postconsumer PLAstic waste and reclaimed pulp FIBer     An European project will valorise post-consumer plastic waste and newsprint paper for new construction, packaging and automotive parts.     Project description:     This project, entitled as CEPLAFIB, will transform two post-consumer wastes: plastic waste and newsprint paper, into novel primary resources for high added value applications through their combination in novel recycled fibre reinforced composite materials. In this sense CEPLAFIB aims to orchestrate a new circular economy in which recycled postconsumer plastic will be reinforced with re-claimed pulp fibres to improve their end performance characteristics and to stabilize the recyclates flows for their direct use in mass application sectors, i.e. automotive, caravanning, packaging and construction. This project will expand from July 2018 to June 2021 and has a total project budget of 1.8M\u20ac     TECOS's role:     Besides coordination management, TECOS is involved in optimization of the final composite formulation, setting up the requirements & processing protocols for automotive prototypes design, injection mould construction, pre-serial testing and technical validation of final demonstrators by up to TRL-6.     CEPLAFIB project will demonstrate that by using the cost-efficient technologies for plastic & paper waste sorting, selection, treatment and transforming processes we can boost the linear economy of recycled materials into circular transition, where plastic waste and newsprint residues seeks their new utility values in the form of composite material for mass production applications. New products developed will be rigid industrial packaging, interior components for recreational vehicles (RV\u2019s), and building isolation panels. To guarantee the maximum efficiency, CEPLAFIB will use a global synergistic approach to drive changes, combining different manufacturing technologies and applications and is focused in complementary roles of diversified industrial sectors. Final demonstrators for caravanning sector will be fabricated in Slovenia, while the production line for rigid packaging is to be settled in Finland. The extrusion compounding line is to be established in Spain, demonstrating that recycled rate can be increased by 40% and the greenhouse emissions can be reduced by 40%, when comparing current recycling activities.     Project information contact at TECOS: dr. Vesna \u017depi\u010d Bogataj     Project status: Running     Duration: 2. 7. 2018 - 30. 6. 2021     Programme: LIFE - Environment and resource efficiency     Sample Project     The client had to renew a wore down rotor with knife segments for which they didn't have any documentation. With precise 3D scanning of the original and creation of functional CAD model we provided them with data for production of replacement.     The customer has presumed problems with excessive warpage in the stage of tool design. The material is PA66 with 30% of glass fibers. With the help of advanced injection moulding analysis we predicted the trend and values of warpage and thus successfully eliminated the problems.     Our client has planned a single phase deep drawing process for the presented case, however several doubts about manufacturability arose. The conducted analysis has cleared all doubts.     We made a comparative study between experimentaly and numerically determined strength of a fibre reinforced product, which yielded extremely good match of the results from both methods. "

      "text":" Mandolin     The mandolin we know today developed in the beginning of the 18th century in Naples and was named after it. It preserved the arched body of its predecessor, the lute, which is glued together from individual frets. It limited the number of strings to four pairs and modelled its tuning after stringed instruments. Due to its slightly curved top it was able to take greater pressure and thus enabled the replacement of gut strings with metal ones. The mandolin became a popular folk instrument especially in Italy, and in the 20th century also elsewhere.     Mandolin ensembles were being formed in Koper from the mid-1890s onwards. The first to be formed was a women's mandolin group, consisting of young ladies from high society. "

Moreover, the CDP analysis identifies the need to deploy unmanned systems to reduce the danger to human personnel and manned platforms, as well as to increase robustness, sustainability and resilience of ground systems. A comprehensive set of unmanned systems should contribute to the capability of land manoeuvre in the joint operational environment to gain positional advantage in respect to the adversary. Purely unmanned tracked vehicles as funded under EDIDP will be not considered under this topic.     Specific challenge     Most military experts and strategists agree that the ability to conduct swarm operations is probably the best response to future threats whether symmetrical or asymmetrical. In this context, it is therefore vital to have the ability to design and conduct long-distance operations against a highly mobile and unpredictable enemy through the flexible use of a significant number of unmanned and coordinated ground and air systems.     Indeed, intelligent and effective cooperation between unmanned ground systems (UGS), manned military vehicles, operators and air systems is needed to increase the robustness, sustainability and resilience of these terrestrial systems while reducing loss of life, the risk of collateral damage and lowering the cognitive burden placed upon operators.     Deploying a swarm-based manoeuvring capability in a framework of cooperation between manned and unmanned systems (manned-unmanned teaming) but also inside the swarm of unmanned systems is undoubtedly the strongest requirement in system design in the field of safety research.     Therefore, rapidly developing a capacity implies an incremental approach capable of proposing capability milestones in line with the development milestones of current and future land systems and allowing upgrades of legacy systems.     Scope: Proposals should address the development of hardware or software modules designed to enable manned-unmanned operation modes and taking into account teaming and swarming, and to be integrated or embedded into a set of digitalised ground Armoured Vehicles     POGOJI SODELOVANJA     Admissibility conditions: described in section 3 of the call document     UPRAVI\u010cENCI     Eligible countries: described in section 3 of the call document     Other eligibility conditions: described in section 3 of the call document     Financial and operational capacity and exclusion: described in section 3 of the call document "

Vpra\u0161anje Roga je vpra\u0161anje o zakonu, redu in lastninskih pravicah. Kdor ne verjame v koncept lastninskih pravic, ne verjame v bistvo Zahodne civilizacije. S tak\u0161nim \u010dlovekom je razprava zelo te\u017eka in v bistvu nesmiselna.\" (vir: twitter)     . . . kaj pa koncept \u010dlovekovih pravic s katerim je zahod operiral v \u010dasu hladne vojne? Le-te pa niso ve\u010d del zahodne civilizacije?     Strinjam se. Tzv. Rogovci niso poslovne\u017ei ali umetniki pa\u010d pa bredzdomci in brezdelne\u017ei. Zagotovo so pred dokon\u010dno ru\u0161itvijo nekdanjega Roga, dobili kar nekaj opozoril in pozivov, da izpraznijo prostore in poskrbijo zase ter doma\u010de \u017eivali, katere so gojili v svojih poslovnih prostorih. Vpra\u0161anje Roga res ni vpra\u0161anje o Zoranu Jankovi\u010du, a nedotakljivi gangster je bil vsem tem vzor, bili so njegova volilna baza. V \u017eivljenju so se kot gradona\u010delnik namenili, da bodo po\u010deli izklju\u010dno tisto, kar jim pa\u0161e. To v normalni civilizaciji, seveda ne gre. V tisto, ne Jankovi\u010d, ne ve\u010dkrat omenjena drhal, \u0161e niso vstopili. Stara kravetina Makarovi\u010dka je zgro\u017eena.

Vrne naj, pi\u0107ka ji materina, vse tisto nezaslu\u017eeno, kar ji je podaril Jankovi\u010d ; pokojnino, pa jurja dodatka in bivanje v presti\u017enem domu za starej\u0161e...

In the Middle Ages, the city was surrounded by a wall, which can still be seen with a keen eye behind the Me\u0161kova, Ozka and Cankarjeva streets. Even the renovated Rotenturn Manor was built from the former Schulthauzinger Tower. The city is located at the crossroads of the paths leading to Mt. Ur\u0161lja Gora and the Pohorje range, offering the travellers coming here primality, a number of unspoiled trails and mysteries worth discovering.

Cast     SHE BARBARA CERAR GRANDMOTHER, MOTHER SA\u0160A PAV\u010cEK FATHER JANEZ \u0160KOF     About the performance     Original title: Engel des Vergessens     PREMI\u00c8RE 14 MARCH 2014 THE PERFORMANCE IS 1 HOUR AND 40 MINUTES LONG AND HAS NO INTERVAL.     \"You know, if you're afraid in the woods, you should sing partisan songs.\"     MajaHaderlap\u2019s novel was extraordinarily well received, because in it she told a story \u2013 literary inventively, poetically and subtly \u2013 that remained on the edge of the social memory, particularly in Austria. The fate of the minority community of Carinthian Slovenians is told through an autobiographical family chronicle, which spans from World War II until today. All the great powers and ideas that have fatefully influenced the situation of the community and its individuals are a part of it;among those bearing the greatest weight are the traumas of World War II and the time after it. Through lyrical personal confession it retells memories: personal, family, collective, told and concealed. The stage adaptation managed to add to the novel a new dimension and to the inner world an outer image through excellent and thoughtful acting interpretations.     \"When the performance The Angel of Oblivionin the direction and adaptation of Igor Pison ends in its soft reconciliation, the spectator, under the influence of such a first-class theatre experience, has difficulties to comprehend what \u2018hit\u2019 him or her most. Was it the precisely worked-out adaptation of the novel; or was it the seemingly muted and ideologically unbiased directing thatwas the reason the story is played out in all its sensory and politically-chargedemotion? Or was it due to the gusts of biographic reality that sprout again through fiction as live probable images? Undoubtedly because of all of the above, but the crown goes to the excellent cast, which carries a contagious spark of total enjoyment in acting.\" (Zala Dobov\u0161ek, Delo)     Photo gallery     Our site uses cookies for social networks connections, better overall site performance and awesome user experience.

      "text":" Teaching and learning how to organize information effectively is a complex process both for educators and students. Cataloguing, which is defined as the process of organizing information by making bibliographic records, is the established procedure for achieving the goal mentioned. Learning the process of cataloguing can be difficult for students because they must become familiar with a large amount of new and complex contents.     In Slovenia, 301 libraries and 689 cataloguers with permits for shared cataloguing of monographs participate in shared cataloguing. The article presents the annual increment of bibliographic and authority records in COBIB.SI in 2019.     The article presents and analyses selected digital humanities projects and research initiatives in which libraries and other heritage institutions participate actively. These ambitious global projects supplement the existing knowledge on general and specific social and cultural-historical phenomena in the field of written cultural heritage with the help of web-based applications, tools and the collaborative location-independent research approach.     The article describes the process of updating Slovenian authority records in VIAF, the entry of identifiers into the CONOR.SI database and their display in COBISS+. For most authority records, the updating in VIAF went smoothly, whereas in some records for personal names errors occurred during the process of putting them into clusters, which were then sorted into four groups and compared with the typical entry-related issues described in the VIAF Guidelines.     The paper gives a new insight into the cataloguing practice in the COBISS.SI system, primarily regarding the necessity of bibliographic data for the management of bibliographies for researchers and research organisations. The paper evaluates two areas in the cataloguing practice, both of them optional but recommended.     OCLC\u2019s WorldCat approaches 475 million bibliographic records. Many of those records have been created manually by members of OCLC\u2019s worldwide cooperative. Others have been added to WorldCat en masse from institutions large and small, from national libraries, from cultural heritage institutions, or from rural public libraries. "

OSNOVNE INFORMACIJE Naslov projekta: Do\u017eivljajsko razstavi\u0161\u010de Ljubljanica Akronim projekta: Ljubljanica Program: Finan\u010dni mehanizem EGP 2009\u20132014 Podro\u010dja razpisa v sklopu B: Kulturna dedi\u0161\u010dina 2. POVZETEK PROJEKTA Reka Ljubljanica je poleg naravnih znamenitosti pomembna predvsem zaradi bogate kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine. Struga reke med Vrhniko in Ljubljano sodi po \u0161tevil\u010dnosti, kvaliteti in znanstveni izpovednosti najdb med najpomembnej\u0161e in hkrati najbolj ogro\u017eenekulturne spomenike v Sloveniji. V bre\u017eino struge pri Verdu je \u0161e vedno ujeta edinstvena rimska tovorna ladja iz 1. stoletja, ki ji zaradi spodjedanja neutrjene bre\u017eine grozi uni\u010denje. Z izvedbo projekta bomo za\u0161\u010ditili najbolj ogro\u017eene dele spomenika z dolgoro\u010dnimi u\u010dinki na varovanje, ohranjanje in prezentacijo ter ustvarili pogoje za bistveno ve\u010djo dostopnost do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine pore\u010dja Ljubljanice. Z interaktivnim in do\u017eivljajskimrazstavi\u0161\u010dem v sredi\u0161\u010du Vrhnike bomo nagovorili \u0161ir\u0161o javnost in ranljive skupine, jih spodbudilik aktivnemu sodelovanju in razvijanju skupne odgovornosti za dedi\u0161\u010dinoter vzpostavili temelje za razvoj turisti\u010dnih dejavnosti, kreativnih industrij in o\u017eivitev starih obrti in lokalnih tradicij. S programsko shemo bomo omre\u017eili \u0161ir\u0161i prostor pore\u010dja Ljubljanicein ustvarili sinergi\u010dne u\u010dinke med kulturno in naravno dedi\u0161\u010dino. Prijavljen projekt pomeni izgradnjo u\u010dinkovite platforme za izvedbo celovite revitalizacije kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine Vrhnike in \u0161ir\u0161e regije v prihodnosti. 3. OPIS PROJEKTA Utemeljitev projekta Utemeljitev projekta in prikaz problematike Struga reke Ljubljanice med Vrhniko in Ljubljano sodi zaradi \u0161tevil\u010dnosti, kvalitete in znanstvene izpovednosti najdb med najpomembnej\u0161a in hkrati najbolj ogro\u017eena arheolo\u0161ka najdi\u0161\u010da v Sloveniji. Za kulturni spomenik dr\u017eavnega pomena je razgla\u0161en vodni tok reke Ljubljanice in Male Ljubljanice z obre\u017eji od izvirov v Mo\u010dilniku in Retovju do razvodja Ljubljanice in Gruberjevega kanala na \u0160pici v Ljubljani. Spomeniku pripada \u0161e del reke Ljubije na Vrhniki do soto\u010dja z Ljubljanico ter raz\u0161irjeno obmo\u010dje spomenika med Kaminom pri Bevkah in ledino Livada pri Podpe\u010di.Doslej je bilo v strugi Ljubljanice in njenih pritokih odkritih \u017ee preko 8000 predmetov iz razli\u010dnih \u010dasovnih obdobij. V bre\u017eino struge pri Verdu je \u0161e vedno ujeta edinstvena rimska tovorna ladja iz 1. stoletja. Skrivnostna reka in njeni nepojasnjeni pojavi so bili v preteklosti navdih \u0161tevilnim mitom in legendam, kot prepoznavna veduta pokrajine in mest je tudi pogost motiv umetni\u0161kih upodobitev. V obdobjih prvih poselitev je slu\u017eila predvsem za hitro in varno komunikacijo, po izgradnji cest in \u017eeleznice ter obse\u017ene urbanizacije pa je prevzela vlogo priro\u010dnega odpadnega kanala. Kulturni spomenik je trenutno najbolj ogro\u017een na obmo\u010dju Verda, kjer zaradi spodjedanja neutrjene bre\u017eine grozi uni\u010denje dvema ploviloma iz rimskega obdobja. Ker gre v obeh primerih za izjemno redke ostanke iz mo\u010dno degradiranih materialov arheolo\u0161kega mokrega lesa, ki se ohranijo izklju\u010dno v mokrem okolju, bi bila \u0161koda ob morebitnem uni\u010denju neprecenljiva. Za\u0161\u010dita tovrstnih spomenikov je zelo kompleksna, ve\u010dji problem pa predstavlja \u0161e velika dimenzija objektov in zahtevna podvodna dela. V neposredni bli\u017eini rimske ladje je bila odkrita tudi najstarej\u0161a lesena konica na svetu, stara okoli 40 000 let. Obmo\u010dje pore\u010dja Ljubljanice ima izjemen potencial na podro\u010dju kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine, dostopnost do nje pa je parcialna in premalo izkori\u0161\u010dena. Posamezne dejavnosti in projekti, ki so bili izvedeni v preteklem obdobju, so preve\u010d razpr\u0161eni in nepovezani. Prav tako je zaznati pomanjkanje dolgoro\u010dnih usmeritev, ki temeljijo na strokovnosti in temeljnem poslanstvu ohranjanja dedi\u0161\u010dine za bodo\u010de generacije ter kvalitetne prezentacije za lokalne prebivalce in turiste, ki bi posledi\u010dno pripomogle k razvoju regije in kvalitetnej\u0161emu \u017eivljenju lokalnih prebivalcev, hkrati pa bi spodbudile razvoj turisti\u010dne dejavnosti in drugih storitvenih dejavnosti. Trend zadnjega desetletja nakazuje obse\u017eno priseljevanje v ljubljanske primestne ob\u010dine z dnevnimi migracijami v prestolnico ter konstantno pove\u010devanje turisti\u010dnega obiska, ki pa je omejen na kratek obisk uveljavljenih turisti\u010dnih destinacij s prete\u017eno vodenimi skupinami. Prav pomanjkanje kompleksnej\u0161e ponudbe za razli\u010dne ciljne publike z mre\u017eenjem posameznih vsebin onemogo\u010da dalj\u0161e zadr\u017eevanje obiskovalcev na tem obmo\u010dju, novo nastala poselitev pa spreminja kraje z bogato tradicijo v spalna naselja prestolnice. Ozave\u0161\u010danje lokalne javnosti s posebnim poudarkom na vzgoji in izobra\u017eevanju ter kvalitetnemu pre\u017eivljanju prostega \u010dasa je zato predpogoj za krepitev identitete kraja, hkrati pa odpira nove mo\u017enosti za razvoj turizma ter o\u017eivljanja starih obrti in lokalnih tradicij. Omogo\u010da tudi kvalitetnej\u0161e varovanje in ohranjanje dedi\u0161\u010dine kot lastne vrednote in potenciala za bodo\u010de generacije. Prepoznavnost Vrhnike je danes razpr\u0161ena med ve\u010d tradicij, med katerimi izstopajo Argonavti (mit), Ivan Cankar (rojstni kraj pisatelja), izviri Ljubljanice (Bistra, Mo\u010dilnik) in industrializacija po drugi svetovni vojni (IUV, LIKO,..). Ljubljanica kot edini tovrstni spomenik naravne in kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine dr\u017eavnega pomena v Sloveniji, z edinstveno in \u0161iroko paleto potencialov (reka sedmerih imen, kra\u0161ki svet, Ljubljansko barje, podvodna arheologija, razvoj mesta skozi razli\u010dna zgodovinska obdobja kot posledica prehodnosti prostora in komunikacij po Ljubljanici,\u2026) je popolnoma zanemarjena, hkrati pa zdru\u017euje vse zgoraj omenjene podobe trenutne prepoznavnosti.Lega Vrhnike in njen potencial sta optimalna dejavnika za razvoj turizma v naj\u0161ir\u0161em pomenu besede: na sredini poti med dvema najbolj obiskanima turisti\u010dnima destinacijama (Postojnska jama in Ljubljana), vpeta med vse tri spomenike, ki so razgla\u0161eni na svetovni seznam dedi\u0161\u010dine UNESCO (\u0160kocjanske jame, Idrija, Ljubljansko barje \u2013 koli\u0161\u010da) in potencialom, da to postane tudi sama (Ljubljanica) ter obse\u017enimi infrastrukturnimi mo\u017enostmi za razvoj turizma ob glavni avtocestni povezavi s katerimi je omogo\u010dena tudi revitalizacija degradiranih obmo\u010dij, ki so posledica propada ve\u010djih industrijskih obratov in posledi\u010dno trajnostni razvoj kraja in \u0161ir\u0161ega zaledja. Za\u0161\u010dita dedi\u0161\u010dine brez revitalizacije, ki je usmerjena v sodobne in aktualne tokove vsakdanjega \u017eivljenja, je nesmiselna in vodi v nadaljnje propadanje, zato je upo\u0161tevanje dostopnosti do dedi\u0161\u010dine skozi razli\u010dne metode komuniciranja klju\u010dnega pomena pri prijavljenem projektu. Poseben poudarek je namenjen sinergiji naravne in kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine, ki predstavlja dodaten potencial za \u0161irjenje dostopnosti. Prispevek projekta k re\u0161evanju problematike Projekt obsega prvo fazo \u0161ir\u0161ega in celovitega projekta revitalizacije kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine Vrhnike, katerega temeljni cilj je varovanje, ohranjanje, prezentacijain maksimalna dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine z dolgoro\u010dnimi u\u010dinki na dru\u017ebeni in trajnostni razvoj v lokalnem, nacionalnem in svetovnem kontekstu ter kvalitetna ponudba za prebivalce kraja ter doma\u010de in tuje obiskovalce. S prijavljenim projektom re\u0161ujemo najbolj akutno ogro\u017eenost edinstvenega spomenika v Sloveniji, ki mu zaradi lege, stopnje degradacije in vrste materiala grozi uni\u010denje. Na podlagi rezultatov predhodnih arheolo\u0161kih raziskav in projekta za sanacijo desne bre\u017eine Ljubljanice bomo izvedli za\u0161\u010ditorimske ladje, ki se po kulturnovarstvenih smernicah ohranja in situ ter premestitev ostankov \u010dolna \u2013 deblaka, ki ga bomo dvignili iz ogro\u017eene lokacije ter za\u0161\u010ditili z aktivno konservacijo in mikroklimatsko komoro, kar bo poleg ohranjanja omogo\u010dilo tudi razstavljanje objekta. S sanacijo bre\u017eine bomo dolgoro\u010dno za\u0161\u010ditili kulturni spomenik v \u0161ir\u0161em obmo\u010dju, hkrati pa prepre\u010dili potencialno uni\u010denje rimske ladje in ekolo\u0161ko katastrofo ob mo\u017eni poru\u0161itvi bre\u017eine in izlitju vode iz enega od ribnikov opu\u0161\u010denih glinokopov na Verdu v Ljubljanico. Na podlagi testnih rezultatov bomo s pilotnim projektom rednega monitoringa, vzor\u010denja in analiz spremljali mikrobiolo\u0161ke in fizikalno-kemijske vplive okolja na rimsko ladjo v Ljubljanici in vzorce lesa v depozitoriju. Dobljeni rezultati bodo namenjeni spremljanju stanja rimske ladje in situ in ustvarjanju mo\u017enosti za trajno hranjenje najbolj ogro\u017eenih spomenikov iz mokrega lesa v depozitoriju ter pripravi standardov za upravljanje tovrstne dedi\u0161\u010dine. Poleg prioritetne za\u0161\u010dite najbolj ogro\u017eenega delaspomenika, bomo v projektu najve\u010djo pozornost namenili dostopnosti do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine, mre\u017eenju v \u0161ir\u0161em prostoru ter o\u017eivljanju degradiranih obmo\u010dij, ki poleg revitalizacije prina\u0161ajo \u0161e dodaten potencial za \u0161irjenje dejavnosti (razvoj turisti\u010dnih dejavnosti, kreativnih industrij, storitvenih dejavnosti,programov za robne in ranljive skupine, vzgojno in izobra\u017eevalno dejavnost za mlade in starej\u0161e, o\u017eivitev tradicionalnih obrti in nesnovne dedi\u0161\u010dine, znanstveno raziskovalno dejavnost ter posledi\u010dno omogo\u010dili gospodarski razvoj in nova delovna mesta). S tem bodo omogo\u010deni tudi pogoji za kvalitetnej\u0161e varovanje in ohranjanje kulturnega spomenika za bodo\u010de generacije. Do\u017eivljajsko razstavi\u0161\u010de Ljubljanica bo ume\u0161\u010deno v sredi\u0161\u010de Vrhnike, saj neposredna lokacija kulturnega spomenika ni primerna (reka, naravovarstveno obmo\u010dje, infrastruktura) in ne omogo\u010da dostopnosti za naj\u0161ir\u0161o javnost. Objekt, ki je namenjen kulturnim in izobra\u017eevalnim programom, je \u017ee v fazi energetske sanacije, zato so stro\u0161ki izvedbe bistveno ni\u017eji in obsegajo izklju\u010dno vlaganje v prostor za potrebe razstave. Kompleksna vsebina razvoja vrhni\u0161kega prostora iz perspektive reke Ljubljanice bo predstavljena nivojsko in ve\u010dplastno za razli\u010dne ciljne publike. Poseben poudarek bo namenjen dinamiki ogleda (slika, zvok, taktili, interakcija, svetlobni in vodni efekti) in sodobnim muzeolo\u0161kim standardom. Izku\u0161nja obiskovalca bo ve\u010dplastna in abstraktno uokvirja tri svetove, ki jih definira prostor reke, kot nosilne gradnike razstave: svet spodaj (podvodni svet, podzemni svet krasa, prostor arheologije, prostor neznanega); svet gladine (nivo vmes, prehajanje iz enega sveta v drugega, ravnina\/tok vode - tok \u010dasa); svet zgoraj (svet ob reki, svet ljudi, svet znanega). Z izvedbo prijavljenega projekta se bomo bistveno pribli\u017eali zadanim ciljem celovitega projekta revitalizacije kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine: - Za\u0161\u010diten, obnovljen in kvalitetno upravljan edinstveni kulturni spomenik dr\u017eavnega pomena. - Prepoznavna celostna podoba spomenika, ki zagotavlja usmeritev v trajnostni razvoj in omogo\u010da izdelavo dolgoro\u010dnih strategij s podro\u010dja varovanja in ohranjanja kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter njihovo prezentacijo in popularizacijo za naj\u0161ir\u0161o doma\u010do in tujo javnost. - Pove\u010dana dostopnost do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter ustvarjen potencial za izobra\u017eevalne, vzgojne, prosto\u010dasne in turisti\u010dne dejavnosti, za razvoj kreativnih industrij, ohranjanje starih obrti in nesnovne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter s tem zvi\u0161ana kvaliteta \u017eivljenja v mestu in \u0161ir\u0161i regiji ter ustvarjena nova delovna mesta. - Vzpostavljena povezava med dvema najbolj obiskanima turisti\u010dnima destinacijama v Sloveniji (Postojna \u2013 Ljubljana) in omre\u017eene lokacije v pore\u010dju Ljubljanice s kvalitetno, interaktivno in do\u017eivljajsko to\u010dko v sredi\u0161\u010du Vrhnike. Dopolnjena ponudba prestolnice in omogo\u010deno dalj\u0161e bivanje turistovna Vrhniki. - Revitalizirano degradirano urbano obmo\u010dje, ki je zaradi razvojnih gibanj zapu\u0161\u010deno in zaostalo v razvoju. Z izvedbo projekta Do\u017eivljajsko razstavi\u0161\u010de Ljubljanica bomo ustvarili u\u010dinkovito platformo za realizacijo ostalih faz celovitega projekta v prihodnosti. Bilateralno sodelovanje z eno od partneric EGP smo na\u010drtovali z raziskovalci Norgesteknisk-naturvitenskapeligeuniversitet in NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet iz Norve\u0161ke, ki se v sklopu mednarodnega projekta RAAR (2003\u20132050) ukvarjajo z ohranjanjem in preme\u0161\u010danjem spomenikov iz mokrega lesa v morskem okolju. Zaradi kratkega prijavnega roka se \u017eal niso pozitivno odzvali. Ker prijavljen projekt na\u010drtuje zelo specifi\u010dne posege (delno pilotne tudi v svetovnem merilu), bi vsako drugo sodelovanje v tej fazi pomenilo zgolj formalnost, zato se zanj nismo odlo\u010dili. Cilji projekta Splo\u0161ni cilj projekta Kulturna dedi\u0161\u010dina obnovljena, restavrirana in za\u0161\u010ditena. Specifi\u010dni cilji Eden od specifi\u010dnih ciljev projekta je vzpostavitev sinergi\u010dnih u\u010dinkovin pove\u010dana dostopnost do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine kot celote. S tem bo omogo\u010dena ve\u010dja prepoznavnost dedi\u0161\u010dine \u0161ir\u0161e regije doma\u010dim in tujim obiskovalcem. Pore\u010dje Ljubljanice je javnosti manj znano predvsem v kra\u0161kem svetu (ponikalnica), nekoliko bolj znani so izviri na Mo\u010dilniku in Retovju. Bogato kulturno dedi\u0161\u010dino (UNESCO \u2013 koli\u0161\u010da, Nauportus, \u2026) dopolnjuje tudi naravna dedi\u0161\u010dina Ljubljanskega barja (Natura 2000, Krajinski park). Specifi\u010dni cilj predstavlja iskanje dolgoro\u010dnih re\u0161itev na podro\u010dju za\u0161\u010dite in ohranjanja dedi\u0161\u010dine iz mokrega lesa zmonitoringi in analizami mikrobiolo\u0161kih in fizikalno-kemijskih dejavnikov okolja. V projektu se poleg akutnega re\u0161evanja najbolj ogro\u017eene dedi\u0161\u010dine v strugi Ljubljanice vzpostavlja trajnostni sistem hranjenja v mokrem okolju (premestitev \/ depozitorij), ki bo bistveno pripomogel k ve\u010djim mo\u017enostim za dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine tudi bodo\u010dim generacijam. Specifi\u010dni cilj predstavlja tudi dostopnost do kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine, ki je bila pridobljena s postopkom abolicije in izvira iz struge Ljubljanice. Namen abolicije je bil poleg dokumentiranja in pravilnega hranjenja predmetov, tudi \u010dim hitrej\u0161a dostopnost do te dedi\u0161\u010dine. V do\u017eivljajskem razstavi\u0161\u010du bodo razstavljeni in interpretirani \u0161tevilni tovrstni predmeti. Ciljne skupine Vsi rezultati projekta so namenjeni naj\u0161ir\u0161i javnosti, z iskanjem dolgoro\u010dnih re\u0161itev pa \u017eelimo dose\u010di predvsem trajnostne u\u010dinke, ki bodo omogo\u010dili dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine tudi bodo\u010dim generacijam. Ozave\u0161\u010danje lokalne javnosti je ena od temeljnih nalog projekta. Z vsebinami in programi, ki segajo v \u0161ir\u0161e obmo\u010dje pore\u010dja Ljubljanice ustvarjamo potencial za razvoj turizma in \u0161irjenje ciljnih publik. Osrednja informacijska to\u010dka z do\u017eivljajskim razstavi\u0161\u010dem je namenjena prevladujo\u010dim in robnim ciljnim publikam, ki jih \u017eelimo spodbuditi k aktivnemu sodelovanju in na\u010drtnemu razvijanju skupne odgovornosti za dedi\u0161\u010dino. S povezovanjem strokovnjakov in vklju\u010devanjem lai\u010dne javnosti ter mre\u017eenjem kakovostnih programov bomo vzpostavili izmenjavo znanja in spretnosti, vrednot in pogledov ter dolgoro\u010dno povezovanje v lokalnem, nacionalnem in mednarodnem prostoru. Z razli\u010dnimi metodami komuniciranja (interakcije, sodobne tehnologije, taktili, atraktivni vodni elementi, eksperimentalne delavnice, programi, dogodki) bomo nagovarjali posamezne starostne in interesne skupine. Posebna pozornost bo s prilagojeno opremo in aktivnim vklju\u010devanjem namenjena ranljivim skupinam in obiskovalcem s posebnimi potrebami. Rezultati za\u0161\u010dite spomenika in analiz bodo dostopne \u017ee v \u010dasu trajanja projekta tako strokovni kot tudi lai\u010dni javnosti.

BASIC INFORMATION Project title: Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site Project acronym: Ljubljanica Programme: EEA Financial Mechanism 2009-2014 Area of the call in Set B: Cultural Heritage 2. PROJECT SUMMARY Besides being natural attraction, the Ljubljanica River is also famous for itscultural heritage. The riverbed between Vrhnika and Ljubljana is classified as one of the most important of its kindin terms of abundance, quality and scientific value of the findings. But it is also one of the country\u2019s most endangered cultural monuments. There is a unique ancient Roman cargo ship dating from the 1st Centuy AD trapped near the village of Verd, threatened to be destroyed by the erosion. Through our project its most vulnerable parts shall not only be protected, but also expertly preserved and made available to a large audience. Our further objective is to allow a considerably easier access to the cultural heritage and natural attractions of the Ljubljanica River for the public. This interactive experience and exhibition site located in downtown Vrhnika has been designed to encourage the public, including vulnerable groups, to activelyparticipate in strengthening common responsibility for heritage and for developmentof tourism, creative industries, revival of old crafts and local traditions. The present scheme is here to create a network and synergies between both cultural and natural heritage preservation activities within the Ljubljanica basin. This project is about an efficient platform for a revitalisation of heritage in Vrhnika and the wider region. 3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Justification of the project Because of abundance, quality and scientific value of its findings, the Ljubljanica riverbed between Vrhnika and Ljubljana is classified as one the most important, but also the highest endangered archaeological sites in Slovenia. The water flow of both the Ljubljanica and Mala Ljubljanica Rivers from their sources at Mo\u010dilnik and Retovje, up to the Ljubljanica and Gruber\u2019s Channel watersheds at \u0160pica is declared cultural monument of national significance. Part of the Ljubija River (Vrhnika) and the area between Kamin, and the Livada fallow, are complementing this monument. So far more than 8000 ancient items have been found here. The unique ancient Roman cargo ship from the 1st century AD is still being trapped near Verd. The mysterious river and its unexplained phenomena have inspired many myths and legends in the past. It has also served as a frequent motif of art. Once primarily used as a means of communication, the river has assumed role of a convenient waste channel following the large-scale urbanisation. This monument is presently most endangered in the area around Verd. The erosion is threatening two ancient Roman vessels. Both are extremely rare residues of badly deteriorated materials - archaeological wet wood that can only be preserved in wet conditions. In case of their destruction the damage would be priceless. It is an extremely delicate and complex task to protect these findings. Their dimensions and the necessary underwater interventions present a major challenge. An additional finding has been discovered in their immediate vicinity: the world\u2019s oldest wooden tip of some 40 000 years. The area of the Ljubljanica basin has great potential in terms of cultural and natural heritage, which at the moment is under-exploited. Specific activities have so far been running too scattered and unrelated and in a lack of long-term orientation, based on expertise and fundamental mission to conserve heritage for future generations including public presentations, all contributing to an improved quality of life of local residents. Service sector and tourism would thereby be encouraged. Massive Immigration to Ljubljana\u2019s suburban has shown in the last decade, causing daily commuting to and from the Capital. Meanwhile, tourist visits are limited to daily trips by guided groups to the famous destinations. Due to the lack of a more complex and differently targeted offer by means of networking a prolonged stay of visitors in this area is prevented. Meanwhile the recent immigration trends are converting these places to the Capital\u2019s dormitories. Promoting quality leisure time and encouraging local community\u2019s awareness are of crucial importance for the area\u2019s identity. At the same time, these activities contribute to new opportunities for local tourism and revitalisation of old crafts and local traditions. It also enables a more efficient protection and preservation of heritage as own value and potential for future generations. Visibility of Vrhnika is suffering from being scattered among its various traditions, such as the Argonauts (myth), Ivan Cankar (writer\u2019s birthplace), the Ljubljanica sources (Bistra, Mo\u010dilnik) and post-World War II industry. Neglected is the Ljubljanica River as the country\u2019s only natural and cultural heritage monument of this type - despite its unique and rich potentials (River of seven names, Karst, Ljubljana Marshes, underwater archaeology, town\u2019s history, etc). are combined by the river. The position of Vrhnika is optimal for tourism in the broadest sense. Located right in the middle between two most frequently visited destinations (Postojna Cave and Ljubljana), and between the three monumental sites listed as world heritage by UNESCO (\u0160kocjan caves, Idrija, Ljubljana Marshes pile dwellings), thanks to the Ljubljanica River the town has great potential to become one by itself. Further great infrastructural opportunities come from its location near the main motorway link, also encouraging a sustainable development of the town including the hinterland, and, finally, revitalisation of areas heavily deteriorated. Protection of heritage without revitalisation focused on modern and current trends of everyday life is meaningless and may lead to further deterioration. Therefore, taking into consideration the accessibility of heritage through a variety of communication methods is crucial for the project. Special emphasis is placed on synergy between natural and cultural heritage as an additional potential for widening the access. Contribution of the project to solving the issue The project represents the first phase of a broader and integrated project of revitalization of cultural and natural heritage of Vrhnika. Its objective is to protect, preserve, and present the heritage, but also to provide maximum accessibility and thereby long-term effects on a sustainable social development in the local, national and global context - including quality offer for the local residents, domestic and international visitors. The project as applied has a mission to solve the most acute threat to the unique monument in Slovenia, threatened due to its location, degree of degradation and type of soil material. Based on the results of previous archaeological research work and the Project for the Rehabilitation of the Right Bank of the Ljubljanica River, we shall conduct both the preservation of the ancient Roman ship which -following the guidelines of cultural protection - shall remain in situand the relocation of the trunk boat residues. The latter shall be raised from its threatened location and protected by using special active conservation methods and microclimatic chamber, allowing the exhibition of the object in addition to its preservation. Through the rehabilitation of the bank, we intend to provide long-term protect to this culturalmonument within an extended area, but also to prevent the Roman ship from its possible destruction. An environmental disaster provoked by the possible collapse of the embankment and the escape of water from one of the ponds belonging to the abandoned clay pits located at Verd into the Ljubljanica shall thereby also be prevented. Based on testresults we shall conduct a pilotproject of regular monitoring, sampling and analyses to monitor microbiological, physical and chemical impact of the environment on the Roman ship both in the Ljubljanica and its wood samples stored in the depository. The results obtained shall be used to monitor the state of the ship in situand create the necessary conditions to preserve the most endangered items from wet wood stored in the depositoryand standards of managing heritage of this type. In addition to the priority of protecting the most threatened part of monument, great attention shall be placed on accessibility of our cultural and natural heritage to a large audience, networking within an extended area and revitalisation of deteriorated areas, bearing additional potential for expansion in terms of tourism, creative businesses, service sector, dedicated programs for marginal and vulnerable groups, educational contents for both young and elderly, revival of traditional crafts and intangible heritage, research and development. Providing an improved prospective of economic development and new employments shall lead to a considerably improved level of protection and preservation of the cultural monument for future generations. The Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site shall be placed right in the centre of Vrhnika, since the the monument\u2019s direct location is less suitable - location at river, within an environmentally protected areaposing infrastructural issues - and would allow a much lessee accessibility to great public. The premise intended for cultural and educational programs is already being subject to energy rehabilitation, so the implementation costs are expected to be much lower and only limited to the investment in the exhibition space. The complex content on the development of the Vrhnika area from the prospective of the Ljubljanica River shall be presented multi-level and multi-layered, adjusted to various target groups. Particular emphasis will be placed on the dynamics of visit (image, sound, clocking, interaction, light- and water-effects) and modern museum standards. The visitor\u2019s experience shall be provided multi-layered in shall in an abstract way framed by three worlds, defined by the river as carrier vehicle of the exhibition: the world below (underwater world, Karst underworld, space dedicated to archaeology, space dedicated to the unknown); the world on the surface (the level in-between, transition from one world to another, the plane \/ flow of the river - flow of the time); the world above (world on the river, world of the people, world of the known). The implementation of the project applied shall bring us much closer to the objectives of the Overall Project of Revitalisation of Cultural and Natural Heritage: - Protected, restored and managed unique quality cultural monument of national importance. - A distinctive comprehensive identity of the monument, which provides guidance on sustainable development and enables producing long-term strategies in the field of protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage as well as their presentation and popularisation for the broadest domestic and international audiences. - Improved access to cultural and natural heritage, potential for educational activities, leisure and tourism businesses, developing creative industries, preserving old crafts and intangible heritage as well as improving quality of life in the city and the wider region with new employments as a result. - Connection established between two of the most visited tourist destinations in Slovenia (Postojna - Ljubljana), networking between locations within the Ljubljanica basin with high quality, interactive and experiential focus point at Vrhnika. Improved offering capacities of the Capital allowing tourists to stay longer in Vrhnika. - Revitalised previously deteriorated urban area, abandoned and lagging behind due to unfavourable economic trends. By implementing of the Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site Projectan efficient platform shall be set-up as basis to achieve further phases of the Overall Project in the future. Bilateral collaboration with Norway, one of the EEA members, has been planned together with the researchers at the Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet in NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet, active in preservation and relocalion of wet-wood-monuments in maritime areas within the RAAR International Project (2003\u20132050). Due to the short application deadline they have unfortunately been unable to respond positively. Since very specific interventions are planned by the project applied (partly pilot projects on the global level), any other partnership would only be formality at this stage, which is why we haven\u2019t opted for such a solution. Objectives of the project General objectives of the project Cultural heritage restored, renovated and protected. Specific objectives One of the specific objectives of the project is to create synergy effects and increased access to cultural and natural heritage as a whole. This will enable greater visibility of the heritage of the wider region for both domestic and international visitors. The Ljubljanica is especially less known to the large public in the Karst area (disappearing underground stream), somehow better known are sources at Mo\u010dilnik and Retovje. The roich cultural heritage (UNESCO \u2013 pile dwellings, Nauportus, etc) are complemented by the natural heritageof the Ljubljana Marshes (Barje, Natura 2000, Nature Park). The specific objective is to find long-term solutions in the field of protection and conservation of heritage items from wet wood by continuous monitoring and analyses of microbiological, physical and chemical environmental elements. In addition to acute rescue of the most endangered heritage in the Ljubljanica Riverbed, the projectshall establish a sustainable system of storage in a wet environment (relocation \/ depository), contributing significantly to improved access options to heritage for future generations. The specific objective is also access to cultural heritage originating from the Ljubljanica riverbed and obtained by abolition. In addition to the documentation and proper storage of items the goal of abolition has been to allow quick access to the heritage. Numerous items of this type shall be exhibited and interpreted at the described Experience and Exhibition Site. Target groups All results of the project are aimed at the general public. It is mainly sustained effects what we are strive to achieve searching for long-term solutions focused access to the heritage of future generations. Raising awareness of the local community is one of the fundamental tasks of the project. The content and programs that concern the wider Ljubljanica area create the potential for tourism development and expansion of target audiences. Central information point with an adventurous Exhibition is intended to dominant edge groups and audience, targeted to be encouraged in sense of an active participation and to systematically develop a shared responsibility for heritage. By bringing together experts, integrating the lay public and by networking all those quality programs the exchange of knowledge and skills, values and attitudes as well as long-term integration of local, national and international arena shall be established. By following various methods of communication (interaction modern technologies, strokes, attractive aquatic features, experimental workshops, programs, events) each age and interest group shall fell addressed. By using customized programs and encouraging active involvement special attention will be paid to vulnerable groups and visitors with special needs. Results in terms of protection of monuments and analyses will be available to both the professional as well as the general public already during the project running.

      "text":" The Holy Trinity Chapel, which protects the city, is positioned amongst the vineyards and, as a proud white guardian, looks silently upon Lendava below, with its green planes through which the Lendava stream meanders. Once there was a garrison stationed on this spot, which is strategically very important for the protection of the city.     Due to its strategic position not even the Turks in the 16th and 17th Century were able to invade this place. After the Turkish incursions and battles were over, grateful believers started to build churches and chapels at several sites.     The Holy Trinity Chapel was one of these that was built with similar intentions in 1727\/28. The construction costs were mainly covered by the Gludov\u00e1cz family, who were well-respected.     In the Chapel there is also a naturally mummified body, which has triggered the imagination of the people of Lendava since time immemorial. This mummy has been connected to many legends. According to local tradition, which is based on the fairytale stories from the first half of the 19th Century, there was a legend that in this Chapel rests Captain Mihael Hadik, one of the famous heroes from the battles against the Turks. It is presumed that he fought in a major battle with Turkish troops in 1603, when Lendava was defended by Krist\u00f3f B\u00e1nnfy. "

PROJECT VISIBILITY     VISIBILITY list of media releases 1 VISIBILITY list of media releases 2     EUROPE FOR CITIZENS Programme     Europe for Citizens Programme adopted for the period 2014-2020 is an important instrument aimed at getting the Union\u2019s 500 million inhabitants to play a greater part in the development of the Union. By funding schemes and activities in which citizens can participate, the Programme is promoting Europe\u2019s shared history and values, and fostering a sense of ownership for how the Union develops.     General features of the Europe for Citizens Programme are:     Equal access     Trans nationality and local dimension     Intercultural dialogue     Volunteering - expression of active European citizenship     The Programme is implemented through two Strands Strand 1: European remembrance: Raise awareness of remembrance, common history and values and the Union's aim. Strand 2: Democratic engagement and civic participation: Encourage democratic and civic participation of citizens at Union level.     Project DOCPIE falls under Strand 2. Measures in this strand are:     Town Twinning     Networks of Towns     Civil Society Projects     PROJECT OBJECTIVES     DOCPIE brings together a diverse audience of 13 countries who will debate, work and be given the necessary information in order to dream the Union\u2019s future. The main objective of DOCPIE is to increase the level of awareness on European citizenship and European identity, on the necessity of democratic participation in European electoral procedures and on the need for development of networks and cooperative strategies in order to strengthen the Union\u2019s inclusive character. In order to achieve its goals, DOCPIE focuses on the improvement of mutual cultural understanding and intercultural dialogue, through the exploration of the notions of European identity, European History, European Modern Democracy as well as the qualities of active citizenship in an inclusive society. According to a recent study by the Jacques Delors Institute, the European Elections turnout rate has dropped by 19 points in 30 years. Such drop in turnout rates can be explained by both exogenous and endogenous causes, and is perceived to indicate a \u201ccivic deficit\u201d on part of institutions and citizens towards the Union. This lack of civic bonding among the citizens and towards EU is a growing trend which has been invigorated by the financial crisis and is currently embodied in the increasing mistrust for EU policies, strategies and actions.The proposed project focuses on the low public interest on EU politics and democratic procedures by addressing the separate elements necessary for democratic participation: more education on EU, enhancement of active citizenship, nurture of the notion of European identity and creation of inclusive and cooperative societies. In an effort to research the reasons of election abstention and lack of interest for European politics, DOCPIE investigates the perceived role of European citizenship and European identity in the lives of groups with different backgrounds. Varying from students to senior citizens, the participants are invited to exchange their views and express their dreams and hopes for the future of Europe. Most importantly, they are invited to feel ownership for shaping of Europe's future.     3.

The GRS Sporter and Hunter models are in fact pretty similar, but the Sporter is better if you hunt with bipods. The reason for this is because the forend is wider and the rear stock has a cut out which makes it better to use when shooting in a prone position.     The SpeedLock 2.0 system makes it easy to adjust the length of pull and cheek piece of the stock. The grip also has an angle of six percent, so the hand is in a natural and steady position.

Straight at the entrance, telling who I was, they really received me with open arms. The people of the club showed me the place around and told where I could find the bands. The venue was not that big as it was in a youth center but looked nice and cosy on the inside. A great and promising start, indeed!     Starting of with our masters of black metal from Slovenia, Grob opened this evening. The public was not in numbers there yet but that didn't influence the performance of this band, with full force and with a second guitarist (which makes this band come to better) they gave a show never to forget. As Alan took the lead and growled his way through the songs like Chaos, they took off this opener as it should be, at the middle of the gig even Oelka from Malorshiga showed up to help out with the song Razkol - this song, done with 2 vocalists gives a new edge to it and made this an unforgetable experience.     Next it was time for the masters of black\/death metal from Portugal, Gaerea.     Presenting their first full length album Unsettling Whispers, touring already most of 2019 and still going on with force on stage they gave a hell of a show and in my opinion should have been the headliner of this tour. With masks and strong music but also the vocals are so good combined in this setup, they were giving it all on stage. The vocalist looked like he escaped from a mental asylum. Songs like Whispers, Absent and the masterpiece Catharsis followed by a few songs form their self titled album of 2016 made this gig something to remember and for the people that were to late there a bit of a bummer because they probably missed out on something new and inovating.     At last it was up to the headliner Numenorean to finish the amazing evening in Koper. For me, this band was something new, I never heard of them before and was surprised by the setup of this band, with 3 guitarists and almost all of them at the vocals.     The main vocalist seemed like he was to busy doing everything else but singing and 3 guitarists were (for my personal taste) just to much as a lot of the sound was lost (or was it because of the sound technician or was it the combination of so many instruments and so many vocals, I can't tell for sure, but the sound with the previous bands was perfect). Still this band kept the audience in and some action was finally happening. Slovenians can learn a bit from the rest of Europe to be honest, I was missing the headbanging and for sure the mosh pits.     V petdesetih letih prej\u0161njega stoletja so se v Sovjetski zvezi pojavili nenavadni razpe\u010devalci, ki so glasbo prepovedanih izvajalcev ponujali kar na rentgenskih slikah.     Album Dreaming Neon Black bi zaradi srhljivega ozadja najbr\u017e zlahka uvrstili med najbolj presunljive plate v metalu.     2020 bo o\u010ditno leto temnega vala. Ponovno obujanje \u017eanra darkwave je v polnem zagonu, zanimivo pa je to, da pri nas \u0161e zmeraj primanjkuje tovrstnih glasbenih zasedb.     18 let organiziranja koncertov raznih oblik ekstremne glasbe ni ma\u010dji ka\u0161elj, tako da lahko na tem mestu Dirty Skunksom samo \u010destitamo.     Noctiferia so nastopili suvereno in brez pretenzije, ki spremlja mnogo sodobnega black metala. Na ta na\u010din so se takoj pribli\u017eali ob\u010dinstvu in intimno vzdu\u0161je Ostrige izkoristili sebi v prid.     Da je ve\u010dina obiskovalcev tokrat pri\u0161la zaradi Voivod, je bilo ve\u010d kot jasno in logi\u010dno, vseeno pa se marsikdo zdaj lahko pohvali, da je enkrat v \u017eivljenju dejansko videl Gwar na koncertu.

Maria Miller, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Maria Miller, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Photo: EPA Hannah Furness By Hannah Furness7:00AM BST 07 May 2013 Comments7 Comments The Arts Council, which plans to distribute \u00a32 billion of government and lottery funding to organisations across the UK before 2015, has argued the culture industry is an \u201cundeniably vibrant sector\u201d, which provides \u201cimpressive\u201d returns on investment. It has today published an independent economic analysis, which found the sector currently makes up 0.4 per cent of GDP compared with just 0.1 per cent of investment. While it does not make a causal link, it found that for every \u00a31 of subsidy provided to the arts and culture industry, the sector made a \u00a37 contribution to GDP. This, the report found, was a higher return than that by the health, wholesale and retail industries, with a turnover of \u00a312.8 billion. Alan Davey, chief executive of Arts Council England, today hailed the findings, saying the industry could now \u201cconfidently confirm the impressive scale of the arts and culture industry and its distinctive strengths and contribution\u201d.

Cut arts funding \u2018at our peril\u2019 25 Apr 2013 If you want another War Horse\u2026 24 Apr 2013 Russian Art Week: cultural treasures on show and for sale RBTH The report follows a call from culture secretary Maria Miller for the arts sector to make an \u201ceconomic argument\u201d for its continued funding ahead of a spending review. Speaking to an audience of museum, theatre and gallery directors last month, she said: \u201cI know this will not be to everyone\u2019s taste but in an age of austerity, when times are tough and money is tight, our focus must be on culture\u2019s economic impact.\u201d     The Department for Culture, Media and Sport last year outlined a 30 per cent cut in grant aid for the Arts Council from \u00a3452 million to \u00a3350 million by 2014\/15. The new study, by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, used data from the Office of National Statistics to calculate revenues, costs of production and \u201cvalue-added\u201d across the arts, including theatre, dance, literature, visual arts, music and museums. It found businesses in the arts and culture sector generated an aggregate turnover of \u00a312.4bn in 2011, with \u00a3856m of that coming from tourism alone. The sector supports 110,600 full-time employees across UK, with \u00a31 paid in salaries returning \u00a32.01 in the wider economy. The report also highlighted the importance of investment on communities, and suggested the arts help to boost national productivity by developing \u201ccritical thinking\u201d, \u201ccreative problem-solving\u201d and communication. Mr Davey said of the sector: \u201cIt is an undeniably vibrant sector with strong links to the wider economy and a key part of our economic future.\u201d Follow Telegraph Art on Twitter "

      "text":" The Renaissance and Renaissances     The Renaissance collection presents a selection of works of art from the second half of the 15th century to the 17th century, when portraiture still showed the last remnants of the classically perceived celebration of individual meritorious mayors of Koper. Upon the renovation and furnishing of the Town Square in Koper in the 15th century one finds orders of figural artefacts made of fired clay (the so-called terracotta). The most beautiful one is the fragment of a relief by Antonio Rossellino \u201cMadonna and Child\u201d. \u201cConstantine's Tondo\u201d and the statue \u201cMadonna and Child\u201d come from the precious inventory of the newly-built Loggia (\u201clobia nova\u201d) in Koper, which had been built in elegant Gothic forms by Tomaso da Venezia and Nicol\u1f78 da Pirano between 1462-64. For exterior and interior furnishings the Great Council soon began choosing new, Renaissance-inspired furnishings.     The symbolical blessing of an important building in the north wing of the Platea Comunis, with a purely Renaissance votive image, signifies the first great Tuscan salutation to the town. The image is ascribed to a sculptor, who fostered older patterns of the soft style together with Renaissance ones. Donatello (1383-1466), one of the protagonists of the new trends, left behind a legacy in Padua in the middle of the century, which also enriched the workshop of our master. Perhaps this work of art is also directly connected to the prestigious furnishings on the fa\u00e7ade of the Loggia, namely the three tondi with images of emperors, which had been commissioned by the town's worthies, proud of their history. The terracotta bearing the image of Constantine testifies to the fast that at the end of the 15th century the town was living in the new spirit of the time and was enthusiastic about antiquity. In the case of the furnishings of the upper fa\u00e7ade of the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary the order was entrusted to the best carvers in Venice, who finished their work in 1498.     In the everyday life of the town, too, the spirit of freemen was prospering in the ranks of the elite nobility, who were united in \u201cCompagnia della Calza\u201d and organised entertaining performances and formal receptions following the example of Venice. The town's scholars socialised with one of the most educated men of the time: the Bishop of Koper, Jacopo Valaresso (1482-1503). The coastal towns are being enriched inside their churches with important works of art, signed by Vivarinis, Bellinis, Paolo Campsa, Cima da Conegliano, Vittore and Benedetto Carpaccio, the Santacroce painters ...     The Renaissance collection lacks the work \u201cSolemn Entrance of Mayor Sebastian Contarini into the Cathedral\u201d, which was painted in 1517 by Vittore Carpaccio. This \u201cfirst European group portrait\u201d presented the source for all subsequent celebratory and self-celebratory manifestations. This painting is one of the many works of art that had been taken to Italy in 1940, accompanied by a promise that they would be returned after the War, which has yet to be fulfilled. "

      "text":" Peer Review Guidelines     1. INTRODUCTION Review may be defined as a critical, multilayer written evaluation of the value of scientific or professional contributions intended for publication that may contain suggestions to improve the quality of the contribution.     The basic goal of the review is to submit to the Editorial Board all data they need to decide whether to publish an article or not. It shall prevent any publication of plagiarism and articles (e.g. research) with incorrect results. Another equally important goal of reviews is to allow the author to learn about the weaknesses or even errors of their work and correct or improve the quality of the submitted article.     The theory of writing scientific articles is part of science about science and can only be presented in these editorial instructions to reviewers to a limited extent. For this reason some related professional literature sources listed as references in the bibliography at the end of this text were used for the elaboration of these instructions. Reviewers are kindly requested to study these sources or perhaps find new, more recent works.     2. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 2.1 The review procedure will make sure that articles for Tehni\u010dni in vsebinski problemi klasi\u010dnega in elektronskega arhiviranja are presented in accordance with the valid Slovenian SIST ISO standards for documentation, as well as international standards to be shortly adopted as Slovenian ISO standards of documentation and information science. Articles must be prepared according to the rules of good writing. All important standards are listed in the references.     2.2 The purpose of the review form is to assist reviewers and make their work more uniform. In this way the Editorial Board of Tehni\u010dni in vsebinski problemi klasi\u010dnega in elektronskega arhiviranja wishes to acquire concise and clear presentation of the review results. It is adapted for the reviewers of scientific articles. For other types of articles the reviewers are requested to apply it correspondingly and leave out the requirements exceeding their scope. If, for example, a professional article that does not represent repetition of a research but a description of another professional work is to be reviewed, generally the author does not have to make an initial hypothesis, etc.     2.3 Reviewing shall be more than (perhaps) mechanical completing of form columns. For this reason reviewers have a possibility to add their own comments in adequate form column (6 Special reviewer's findings), enclose comments to the form or write a separate reviewer's article. Especially in the latter case reviewers shall pay attention to meet the original goal of the review.     2.4 The reviewer should focus on the contextual aspect of the article (interest, innovation, suitability for publishing) since the authors who do not follow editorial guidelines are asked to correct their texts. However, the reviewer points to an eventual language inadequacy of the article (incorrect use of scientific terminology and language incomprehension) or inconsistencies at citing or at the scientific equipment of the article (footnotes, references).     2.5 The reviewer also points to eventual essential or slight remarks on the text. He\/she also checks if the topic has already been researched and the author did not consider previous findings. The reviewer should also pay special attention to the methodological aspect of the article (suitability of used methods, sampling, hypothesizing) and the structure of the article. Minor remarks or\/and corrections can be written in the text.     2.6 Reviewer decides whether the article is:     appropriate for publication without improvements;     appropriate for publication with minor improvements (editor's decision)     appropriate for publication after major improvements and another revision;     not appropriate for publication.     2.7 The reviewer defines the classification, which can differ from the one suggested by the author. Typology of documents\/works for bibliography management in the Slovenian cooperative bibliographic system COBISS is used:     1.08 Published Scientific Conference Contribution A published scientific conference contribution (lecture, presentation, poster), published as a whole in the separate conference proceedings, in a scientific journal or on the conference's and\/or conference organiser's website. The published contribution should, in principle at least, be organised as a scientific article.     1.09 Published Professional Conference Contribution A published scientific conference contribution (lecture, presentation, poster), published as a whole in the separate conference proceedings, in a scientific journal or on the conference's and\/or conference organiser's website. The published contribution should, in principle at least, be organised as a scientific article.     1.25 Other articles. All articles which could not be classified in any of the above mentioned classes.     2.8 The reviewer may write the whole review as a special review paper or enclose part of it to the form.     The enclosure may include e.g.:     special reviewer's observations that cannot be classified in the form columns,     requests for corrections and completions of the reviewed text,     comments related to the completing of the form, when considered necessary.     Especially negative evaluations and (later) recommendation to the Editorial Board not to publish the article require adequate argumentation.     2.9 Reviewers of individual articles are chosen by the editorial board respecting the anonymity of the review procedure. Reviews are given to authors anonymously. The reviewer keeps one copy of the review for his use in case of a new review. With signing this form, the reviewer declares that he\/she will cooperate with the editorial board of Tehni\u010dni in vsebinski problemi klasi\u010dnega in elektronskega arhiviranja as a reviewer, will respect the process' anonymity principle and will not use information and findings from the reviewed article before its publishing.     2.10 Signed review should be sent to the editorial board address: Pokrajinski arhiv Maribor, Publikacija Tehni\u010dni in vsebinski problemi klasi\u010dnega in elektronskega arhiviranja, Glavni trg 7, SI-2000 Maribor or via fax +3862\/ 228 50 39, +3862\/252 25 64 or scanned at radenci2015@pokarh-mb.si.     3.

      "text":" Fish That is High in Omega 3 Fatty Acids [List]     And there is no better thing than eating a wild fish that we caught by ourselves.     Different fish species have different content of nutrients which are beneficial for our health. One of those nutrients is Omega 3 fatty acids.     Here I am going to answer some common questions about Omega 3 and list you some of the tastiest fish that is high in Omega 3, in the following chapters:     What are Omega 3 Fatty Acids Good for?     Firstly, you have to know what exactly are omega 3 fatty acids.     There are three types of it, and two are present in seafood and fish.     Those are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The third one is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).     ALA can\u2019t be produced by our bodies so the only way to get it is from food.     When you consume food like flaxseed, you will get ALA. A small part of with can actually be converted into EPA and DHA, however, that amount is not enough.     The only way to get them in a sufficient amount is to consume fish or supplements.     Although supplements can deliver the required quantities, it is still better to eat a tasty fish, which will give you other necessary nutrients too.     These acids are a part of your cells. They are present in cells membranes. Your eyes and brain are especially sensitive to the lack of these acids. Every organ in your body is made of cells and that is why omega 3 are so important.     Omega 3 are good for energy too, and have a beneficial effect on your cardiovascular system.     Your lungs, endocrine system and immune system will also highly benefit from it.     The exact daily recommended intake has not been established by experts, except for ALA, but regular sea food consummation will provide you plenty.     Here are the most important benefits of Omega 3 Fatty Acids:     Cardiovascular system disease prevention     Your cardiovascular system will highly benefit from Omega 3.     Many people who eat unhealthy food containing a lot of fat, will have their triglyceride levels high. Regular consumption (at least 2 times a week according to the experts) of seafood rich in Omega 3 will help your body to establish normal triglyceride levels, and reduce the risk of developing different cardiovascular diseases.     Cognitive function improvement     When it comes to your brain, Omega 3 is beneficial for your cognitive functions and prevention of diseases like Alzheimer and dementia.     Omega 3 is not a magical cure, but it can reduce the chance you get some of these diseases, and if you do get them, to slower their progress.     Cancer prevention     Some preliminary research show that Omega 3 could lower the risk of cancer development, however, this has not been confirmed yet.     Same as with everything else, you should not exaggerate with seafood consumption. If you eat it few times a week, there is no need to take any supplements or increase the Omega 3 intake.     What Fish is High in Omega 3 Fatty Acids?     Fish that is high in Omega 3 will have all those positive effects on your body which were listed in the previous chapter.     If you are wondering what fish is high in Omega 3 fatty acids, and also among the healthiest fish to eat, here is a list:     Salmon     Salmon is very tasty, fatty, fish that almost everyone loves to eat.     You can cook it or eat it smoked, depending on your personal preference. Per one serving, salmon contains more than 3000 mg of Omega 3.     Besides that, salmon is full of vitamin B, vitamin D and selenium. These are all beneficial for human health.     Sardine     Sardines are one of the most popular fish specie around the world.     And extremely healthy too. One serving contains more than 2000 mg of Omega 3.     It also contains a lot of vitamin B, D, and selenium. Sardines are frequently available in cans too, and are quite affordable.     Atlantic mackerel     Mackerel is a small fish species, regularly consumed in the western world.     It can be cooked, or even smoked. Except for a high amount of Omega 3 fatty acids (more than 3000 mg per serving), they contain a lot of B12 vitamin and selenium. And not to forget, these are very tasty too.     Herring     Herrings are smaller fish, usually quite accessible and reasonably priced.     It is easy to cook them and they are rich in Omega 3 (about 1000 mg per serving).     Lake trout     Lake trout is extremely tasty, and healthy too.     This fish contains more than 1000 mg of Omega 3 per serving. Other trout species also contain a fair amount of Omega 3 fatty acids; however, lake trout has the most.     Cod     Cod has a bit lower Omega 3 content (below 1000 mg per serving), however it has a lot of vitamin B, phosphorus and selenium.     Because it is not so fatty, it has less calories too.     This fish is very healthy, and good for those who want to limit their calorie intake but still get a good amount of Omega 3 in their lunch.     Albacore Tuna     All tuna fish species are tasty and healthy, especially Albacore tuna.     This fish has more than 2000 mg of Omega 3 per serving.     Unfortunately, not all of us can get our hands-on Albacore tuna weekly, so use the opportunity when you can.     The reason why I wrote the content in serving size instead of per gram, is that rarely you will weight a fille you remove from a fish, or defrost is if you bought it frozen.     Additionally, many of you will consume fish in a restaurant, so you wont actually know how much it weights.     Typical serving size it the amount that a grown-up person eats per meal (lunch\/dinner).     Serving size, depending on a meal and side dish, is usually 100-250 grams.     Does Cooking Fish Reduce Omega 3?     It is good to consume fish that is high in omega 3, but will thermic processing reduce its content?     When exposed to extremely high temperatures, Omega 3 fatty acids will break down and the end result will be a tasty meal, but not that healthy one.     As you can assume, frying fish is the worst method.     A lot of people like fried bass - why? Check on the link ...     First of all, oil can reach very high temperatures so you will destroy Omega 3.     The second problem is that you will consume a lot of unhealthy oil which was used for frying.     If you want to keep the majority of Omega 3, try baking fish in the oven.     Put it on a temperature up to 200 degrees Celsius (390 Fahrenheit), and not warmer. This way, you will keep most of it and enjoy a healthy and nutrient rich meal.     Even better way is to cook it, but this limits your possibilities, as most fish species are baked or fried. While cooking it, you will never go over 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit), because that is the boiling point of water.     And the best option to keep all the nutrients is to eat smoked fish fillets.     Fish processed that way was not exposed to high temperatures and it contains all the Omega 3 it had when caught.     Just be careful not to eat too much because smoked fish contains a lot of salt.     Another thing that affects the loss of nutrients is prolonged heat exposure. The longer it takes, the more Omega 3 you will destroy, especially when frying it.     Does Canned Tuna Have Omega 3 Fatty Acids?     There are a lot of misconceptions and myths about tuna, especially canned one.     I will not debunk those now, but I will tell you about Omega 3 content of canned tuna.     Not every canned tuna is the same.     Albacore tuna, even when canned, has a high amount of Omega 3. Only canned fish with more Omega 3 are salmon and sardines.     Canned tuna should have larger pieces instead of tiny ones. Also, depending on a part of the tuna that ends up in a can, content of Omega 3 can vary.     Some people don\u2019t have access to fresh fish, and canned versions are easily accessible, and frequently cheaper.     If you wondered what fish is high in omega 3 fatty acids and comes in a canned form, the answer is Albacore tuna, as already mentioned.     This is definitely the best option.     Other species of tuna fish also contain Omega 3, and canning process doesn\u2019t significantly lower the Omega 3 content, however, those species contain less of it, even when fresh.     Conclusion     Fish that is high in omega 3 has a lot of health benefits, and those affect some of our most important organs.     Regularly consuming of fish species from this list is good for you, and you can even consume canned ones, because they will still contain plenty of Omega 3 fatty acids.     Be careful how you cook it, not to destroy these precious nutrients.     Except for omega 3, these species all contain a lot of vitamin B, which is also good for our bodies.     And one more thing, you should make sure that you always consume fresh and correctly stored fish, otherwise you are risking food poisoning.

Alignment laser accelerates machine tool assembly checks     The ultimate accuracy and reliability of a machine tool depends in no small degree on the alignment checking during its assembly. For machine tools produced in high volumes, the efficiency of the alignment checking process is paramount. Seeking an alternative to traditional error measurement techniques, Hurco Manufacturing Ltd. (Hurco) chose Renishaw's XK10 alignment laser system to increase both precision and throughput.     Background     A true pioneer in the application of computer technologies in machine tool design, Hurco is a global provider of CNC machines. Founded in Indiana, USA in 1968, the company manufactures a comprehensive range of products including 5-axis CNC machines, multi-axis CNC lathes, vertical machining centres and turning centres.     Its worldwide customer base comprises precision tool, die and mold manufacturers, independent job shops, specialised short-run production manufacturing companies and OEMs of metal fabrication tools. The company's product portfolio includes three well-known brands: Hurco, Milltronics and Takumi.     Hurco Manufacturing was established in Taiwan in 1999 and is today responsible for the manufacture and assembly of the complete range of Hurco machine tools. To ensure requirements for machine tool precision, safety and reliability are met, strict quality control is paramount for each step in the manufacturing process.     Hurco and Renishaw team members     Challenge     Hurco using XK10 alignment laser system     With Hurco producing more than 2,000 machine tools every year, increasing measurement efficiency was a vital driver for the company's inspection and verification processes. Not only did machine measurement and alignment need to be highly accurate, it also needed to be faster.     Alignment inspections during the assembly process were carried out by Hurco using a blend of traditional measurement tools, CMMs and state-of-the-art calibration equipment. The company had long employed a range of Renishaw solutions, including the XL-80 laser interferometer, QC20-W ballbar system and XR20-W rotary axis calibrator.     The sheer size and scale of cast machine tool components presented significant restrictions for CMM solutions, while the inherent weaknesses of traditional measurement techniques risked limiting operational performance. Wang Shun-Chien, Vice President of Hurco Manufacturing explained: \u201cIn the past, we have measured and aligned our cast products using coordinate-measuring machinery, but the larger dimensions of cast parts were always a limiting factor, and made it rather labour intensive.\u201d     He continued, \u201cWe would also use traditional error checking tools like granite squares, dial gauges and autocollimators during the assembly process, but these were never efficient enough, and the measurement results were too inconsistent.\u201d     \u201cWhen we needed to measure the parallelism of some large cast parts, if the granite square and guide rail are a distance away, then the dial gauge needed to be extended to reach the granite, which would then cause any deviation result to amplify.\u201d     Hurco set itself the task of identifying a more accurate machine tool alignment solution. One which was much less time and labour-intensive to set up and use, and which could replace the traditional measurement methods.     Solution     Following extensive research and testing, Hurco chose to adopt Renishaw's XK10 alignment laser system. The XK10 can be applied to linear rails to ensure they are straight, square, flat, parallel and level, as well as to spindles and chucks to assess direction and coaxiality of rotary machines.     An all-in-one digital measurement solution suitable for a range of different CNC machine tools, the XK10 comprises a launch unit for primary laser transmission; wireless transmitter and receiver units; a portable display unit and a fixturing kit. An additional XK parallelism kit carries out parallelism measurements.     The XK10's compact size, wireless connectivity and versatile fixturing means that it can be used in many different configurations, enabling detection and measurement of both geometric and rotational errors across all types and sizes of machine tool.     The display unit enables the operator to collect, analyse and record measurement data. It provides step-by-step instructions for each type of measurement, with intuitive graphics and real-time readings guiding the operator through each stage of the measurement process.     Unlike an autocollimator, which depends on the principle of converting angular measurements into linear measurements, the XK10 alignment laser system takes linear measurements directly, thereby removing the inherent conversion error. Importantly, breaking the XK10's laser beam during data capture does not require a complete restart, unlike with a laser interferometer solution.     By replacing various sizes of granite squares, the XK10 has also solved the problem of limited storage space and logistics. Thanks to its portability and flexibility, it is easy to take to site, performing precision measurements in real time.     Hurco Manufacturing Ltd. (Taiwan)     XK10 all-in-one digital measurement solution     XK10's display unit to collect, analyse and record measurement data     Results     The XK10 alignment laser system succeeded in significantly reducing the amount of time Hurco needed to implement high-accuracy machine tool alignment. After testing the XK10 system repeatedly, they found that it provided a solution that is genuinely capable of replacing traditional methods.     Mr Wang said, \"As a conservative estimate, I'd say that Renishaw's XK10 alignment laser system has at least doubled our overall measurement efficiency, and our evaluation process has proven that the measurement results tally precisely with those from high-precision coordinate measuring machines.\"     With a generous measurement range of 30 m the XK10 handles the requirements of many large machine tools. Negotiating the span between guide rails for parallelism measurements has become easy, removing the need for large granite squares and avoiding the deviation risk of hyper-extended dial gauges.     Mr Wang continued, \"The XK10 has particularly impressed us in terms of the parallelism measurement between two measurement rails. Compared to autocollimators, setting up the XK10 for multiple rail measurements is much simpler. We align the laser unit and turn the laser beams through 90\u00b0 with the XK parallelism kit. The system then automatically analyses the data collected and provides us with measurements of the parallelism between the two rails. It couldn't be easier.\"     \u201cBy replacing various sizes of granite squares, the XK10 has also solved the problem of limited storage space and logistics. Thanks to its portability and flexibility, it is easy to take to site, performing precision measurements in real time. It is used for machine tool assembly, calibration and maintenance, and by enabling better understanding of the status of each CNC machine, resources can be allocated more effectively.\u201d     Mr Wang added, \u201cThe reports that the XK10 produce are also highly intuitive, and through a choice of tables or charts, clients can very quickly determine the status of a machine tool during an acceptance inspection.\u201d     \u201cNow that we have the XK10, we can quickly ascertain whether the source of deviation is connected to the assembly process, rather than workpiece machining or cast part rigidity. And if we discover issues with the precision of the workpiece machining, we can rapidly respond by checking the CNC machines and performing any necessary adjustments. It has really helped us to drive up efficiency.\u201d     Since it was first founded, Hurco has used virtually all of Renishaw's calibration products, including the XL-80 laser interferometer, QC20-W ballbar system and XR20-W rotary axis calibrator. Mr Wang explained: \u201cThe addition of the XK10 has made our arsenal of measurement instruments even more comprehensive, giving us dedicated instruments for machine tool assembly, calibration and maintenance. It also allows us to gain a better understanding of the status of each CNC machine so that we can allocate resources more flexibly.\u201d     Next steps     Downloads     The ultimate accuracy and reliability of a machine tool depends in no small degree on the alignment checking during its assembly. For machine tools produced in high volumes, the efficiency of the alignment checking process is paramount. Seeking an alternative to traditional error measurement techniques, Hurco Manufacturing Ltd. (Hurco) chose Renishaw\u2019s XK10 alignment laser system to increase both precision and throughput. "

      "text":" Vsebina     Resources     To construct buildings or recruit units you need resources. You receive resources automatically from your resources production (<a href=\"\/wiki\/Timber_camp\" title=\"Timber camp\">timber camp<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Clay_pit\" title=\"Clay pit\">clay pit<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wiki\/Iron_mine\" title=\"Iron mine\">iron mine<\/a>). You also receive those resources when you are not logged into your account.     The amount of resources that you get depends on the size of your resource buildings. It is important to build up your <a href=\"\/wiki\/Warehouse\" title=\"Warehouse\">warehouse<\/a> to make sure that you don't lose the resources that don't fit. At the top right of your screen you can see how many resources your warehouse can hold, and how many you currently have.     The number on the right shows how many of each resources can be stored. In this example, a maximum of 53313 wood, 222435 clay and 21519 iron can be stored. The numbers to the left of that show the resource amounts that are stored right now.     First steps     In the beginning you mostly need one thing: Resources. The <a href=\"\/wiki\/Timber_camp\" title=\"Timber camp\">timber camp<\/a> cuts wood, the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Clay_pit\" title=\"Clay pit\">clay pit<\/a> collects clay and the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Iron_mine\" title=\"Iron mine\">iron mine<\/a> produces iron. The more you expand those buildings the more they produce. When you first join a world it is recommended to build up your resource production by a few levels.     After you have secured a good base production of resources you can start building troops. In the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Barracks\" title=\"Barracks\">barracks<\/a> (Level 3 Headquarters needed) you can start recruiting <a href=\"\/wiki\/Spear_fighter\" title=\"Spear fighter\">spear fighters<\/a>. Spear fighters offer some protection against would-be attackers who might want to plunder your resources. They are not usually good attacking troops, but they are useful for raiding very small, undefended villages in order to plunder their resources.     In addition to recruiting troops, there are also other ways to help protect your village and defend your resources in the early stages of the game. One way to protect your resources is to build up your <a href=\"\/wiki\/Hiding_place\" title=\"Hiding place\">hiding place<\/a>. The bigger the hiding place, the more resources are safe from attackers. Another good deterrent is to build a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Wall\" title=\"Wall\">wall<\/a> (Level 1 barracks needed). The higher your wall level the stronger your village's basic defense will be. This means your enemies will suffer higher losses when they attack villages with higher wall levels.     If you find you have excess resources, you might want to consider building a <a href=\"\/wiki\/Market\" title=\"Market\">market<\/a>. (Level 3 headquarters and level 2 warehouse needed). In the marketplace, you can see what your neighbors are offering and trade away resources you don't want. You can also create your own offers.     You should also look around your area to find a good <a href=\"\/wiki\/Tribes\" title=\"Tribes\">tribe<\/a> to join. It is always easier to fight and defend in a group. It is also a good way to meet some nice people!     Late start     Should you join a world that has been going on for a while already it is recommended to change your strategy a bit. It is of course still important to get a good basic resource production so that it is possible to build up your village quickly. But you have to quickly start protecting your village. For that it is best to build up your wall and hiding place and also to build a few units. Writing your attacker can often help as well. It is always recommended to use the units you produced to plunder other villages. The plundered resources greatly help your growth.     Now we'll show you the biggest difference to the usual start:     Don't make the mistake to concentrate too much on creating your first nobleman. It might sound logical to try to get a second village as quick as possible but it does not help you if you can't defend your villages. If you only concentrate on the noblemen you are an easy target, and also a well liked target as bigger players would love to have a village that is already on the way to being ready to produce a noblemen itself. By that time that the attacks start coming in, it's usually too late.     The only strategy against this is a defensive strategy. This means creating lots of sword and spear fighters. If you create enough troops you are a very expensive target and they usually try to find an easier target. The morale also helps you if you are attacked by bigger players. A very big player loses up to 70% of his attack strength due to morale.     The security phase costs a lot of time, but it will pay out as well, as you can always use those defensive troops in the late game. Once you have a good defense build up, something like 1200 spears and 1200 swords, you can start thinking about a nobleman.     You will probably be able to tell how valuable that tactic was by looking at your neighbors villages ...     Village overview     The village overview give you a lot of information about your village on one page. You can see the size of your buildings, the current resource production, your troops and troop movements.     You can switch between the classical and the graphical village overview. The classical overview is a big advantage when you are on a slow Internet connection. If you have a premium account you will get a lot of very useful added information like the production in your buildings, the amount of merchants and the time when your warehouse will be full.     Here is also a labelled village overview that shows what the different buildings look like.     Buildings do change their appearance depending on their size. Here you can see when the buildings change their picture:     You can rename your village by going to the headquarters. On the bottom left under the buildings you see your currents village name, which you can edit and save with \"change\".     Construct buildings     If you want to construct a building, you have to click on the village headquarters and then click on \"expansion to level X\". You need the specified amount of wood, clay and iron. The exact amount depends on the kind of building and its level. The bigger you want to construct the building, the more resources are needed for the next level.     Additionally some buildings need other buildings at specific levels as requirement. As example, you can only build a market after you have constructed a warehouse up to a certain level. In the headquarters you see those requirements as well as the costs. You find more about that in the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Buildings\" title=\"Buildings\">Building overview<\/a>.     Recruiting units     You can recruit your first units in the barracks. To construct barracks you need to upgrade your headquarters to level 3. First you will only be able to build spear fighters; for other units you need e.g. a smithy and new buildings (such as the stables and workshop). In the <a href=\"\/wiki\/Units\" title=\"Units\">Unit overview<\/a> you can find a short description about the requirements for a certain unit and what its properties are. "

In its almost 7 years of existence the organization has managed to organize many round tables and workshops, which were aimed to help people to deal with unemployment in Slovenia, as well as several public campaigns dedicated to labour issues and precarity. The organization informs general public about labour rights, as well as follows the personal stories of precarious workers.     Movement closely collaborates with Slovenian scholars and experts on the respective matters. Moreover, the members of Movement prepare written contributions, in which they discuss the modern labour problems, which Slovenian workers face with, comment the decisions of the government and ammendments to legislation. These contributions are monthly published on the Movement\u2019s website and Facebook page. Apart of it, the members of Movement are constantly educating themselves about labour legislation and other legal matters related to labour market, as well as about the sociological, historical, psychological, and other theories of precarious work in order to determine its specific problems and articulate solutions to them.     Our main goals:     Decent work;     Decent and more prosperous society;     Change of outdated approaches of the governing elites;     Freedom of speech.     Our main activities:     National conference on the issues of precarity (held annually in November);     Annual summer camp \u201cPogum za spremembe\u201d (Courage to change);     Participation in the projects connected with the precariat and vulnerable situation on labour market;     Organization and participation in protests;     Meetings with Slovenian precarious workers;     Organization of workshops, lectures, and round tables;     International projects (EVS).

      "text":" Overview     Overview     Introduction     Accurate analysis of the spine and spinal structures from medical images is an essential tool in many clinical applications of spinal imaging. Knowledge of the detailed shape of individual vertebrae can considerably aid early diagnosis, surgical planning and follow-up assessment of a number of spinal pathologies, such as degenerative disorders, spinal deformities, trauma and tumors, as well as for the evaluation of vertebral fractures. Segmentation and classification of fractured vertebrae by computer-assisted techniques may therefore provide additional support to diagnosis and treatment of vertebral fractures.     The goal of the computational challenge on Segmentation and Classification of Fractured Vertebrae () is to bring together researchers who are interested in the spinal imaging and image analysis, validate the performance of their existing or newly developed algorithms on the same standard database of images with vertebral fractures, and provide a standardized evaluation framework for segmentation and classification results comparison and ranking.     Vertebral Fractures     Vertebral Fractures     A vertebral fracture is observed as a collapse of the vertebra that occurs due to conditions such as osteoporosis, excessive pressure, or trauma. Radiography of the thoracolumbar spine is the standard imaging approach for evaluating vertebral fractures in clinical practice, however, visual interpretation of vertebral body deformations from two-dimensional (2D) radiographic images is a challenging task due to the projective nature of images and variability in the shape of both normal and pathologically deformed vertebral bodies. Vertebral fractures are therefore often undetected by clinicians or under-diagnosed by radiologists. As both over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis may have clinically serious consequences for individual subjects, radiologists have to be well-trained and with long-term clinical experience to provide a successful visual interpretation and correct diagnosis of vertebral body deformations. To reduce the subjectivity in interpretation and improve the agreement among observers, quantitative morphometry (QM) and semiquantitative (SQ) methods were proposed and extended to computerized evaluation of vertebral fractures, often supported by image processing and analysis techniques. On the other hand, by generating detailed 3D images of the anatomy, computed tomography (CT) provides means for accurate measurement of vertebral deformations in three dimensions (3D). Segmentation of fractured vertebrae in 3D may provide additional support to surgical treatment of vertebral fractures, for example, to measure the volume of the vertebral body in the case of vertebroplasty, while the detection and classification of vertebral fractures may provide support to clinical practice, and to research and understanding of vertebral fractures. Although the application in 3D may not compensate for additional costs and patient exposure to ionizing radiation in the case of CT imaging, the benefits of an accurate diagnosis outweigh the associated risks, and CT imaging of the spine is frequently performed to accurately measure bone density in the spine and predict whether vertebral fractures are likely to occur in patients who are at risk of osteoporosis.     Evaluation of Vertebral Fractures     To evaluate vertebral fractures, quantitative morphometry (QM) methods were designed that [1-4] apply the standard six-point vertebral morphometry to sagittal radiographic images, which consists of manual placement of six points on the corners of vertebral bodies and at the centers of vertebral endplates. From these points, the anterior, central and posterior vertebral body heights are measured and used to calculate the anterior-to-posterior, central-to-posterior and posterior-to-posterior-adjacent height ratios (the latter is calculated if the posterior height of the superior- or inferior-adjacent vertebral body is available). To distinguish vertebral fractures from various deformations that normally occur in healthy subjects, the obtained heights and height ratios are then compared to their normative values. Despite the relatively objective nature of QM methods, manual measurement of vertebral body heights is time-consuming, and even a relatively small measurement imprecision may have a considerable impact on the classification of vertebral body deformations. In clinical practice, radiologists prefer visual estimation of the loss in vertebral body heights over manual measurement of vertebral body heights. As a result, the semiquantitative (SQ) method of Genant et al. [5], which introduced specific morphological cases and grades of vertebral body fractures, is accepted as the \u201cground truth\u201d for the evaluation of vertebral fractures. By estimating the anterior, central and posterior height of the vertebral body in sagittal radiographic images, the SQ method defines the following morphological cases of vertebral fractures:     Wedge     The wedge (anterior) morphological case of vertebral fractures is characterized by a distinctive difference between the anterior and posterior vertebral height.     Biconcavity     The biconcavity (middle) morphological case of vertebral fractures is characterized by similar anterior and posterior but a smaller central vertebral height.     Crush     The crush (posterior) morphological case of vertebral fractures is characterized by the mean vertebral height lower than the statistical value for that vertebra or for adjacent vertebral bodies.     Moreover, the SQ method defines the following morphological grades of vertebral fractures:     Mild     The mild (1) morphological grade of vertebral fractures is characterized by a 20\u201325% reduction in the vertebral height.     Moderate     The moderate (2) morphological grade of vertebral fractures is characterized by a 25\u201340% reduction in the vertebral height.     Severe     The severe (3) morphological grade of vertebral fractures is characterized by an over 40% reduction in the vertebral height.     Crush case (3) [posterior]     Mild grade (1) [20% - 25%]     The Challenge     In the past decade, computational challenges have become an integral part of the medical imaging community, and regularly organized events within the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention - MICCAI and International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging - ISBI conferences.     Computational challenges in the field of spine medical image analysis have already been successfully organized within the dedicated annual MICCAI satellite event. The 2nd MICCAI Workshop & Challenge on Computational Methods and Clinical Applications for Spine Imaging - MICCAI-CSI2014 hosted two challenges on \u201cSpine and Vertebrae Segmentation\u201d and \u201cVertebrae Localization and Identification\u201d, and the 3rd MICCAI Workshop & Challenge on Computational Methods and Clinical Applications for Spine Imaging - MICCAI-CSI2015 hosted two challenges on \u201cAutomatic Vertebral Fracture Analysis and Identification from VFA by DXA\u201d and \u201cAutomatic Intervertebral Disc Localization and Segmentation from 3D T2 MRI Data\u201d.     The challenge builds on the two previous challenges, \u201cSpine and Vertebrae Segmentation\u201d from MICCAI-CSI2014 and \u201cAutomatic Vertebral Fracture Analysis and Identification from VFA by DXA\u201d from MICCAI-CSI2015. However, while the former challenge targeted healthy vertebrae in CT images and the latter challenge targeted fractured vertebrae in DXA images, the challenge can be considered as successor of these two challenges as it targets fractured vertebrae in CT images. The goal of the challenge is therefore to:     bring together researchers who are interested in spinal imaging and image analysis, especially in vertebra segmentation and fracture classification problems,     validate the performance of their existing or newly developed algorithms on the same standard database of clinical images with vertebral fractures,     provide a standardized evaluation framework for vertebra segmentation and fracture classification results comparison and ranking.     The challenge is supported by the SpineWeb, an online collaborative platform for everyone interested in research on spinal imaging and image analysis, and registered with the Grand Challenges in biomedical image analysis.

I knew it had been done before, but in my mind, while many of the listings had been appropriate, a certain amount of political correctness had crept into the selection process. We had to do something different, the BFS top 100 listing would be based on one thing: the music, and no amount of politicking would push a recording up the ladder even one position. Another consideration was that this listing would be for \"rock\" albums. Not rock and roll, not Motown, not folk, not metal, not jazz, not rap, not the blues, not anything except good old fashioned \"rock\". Granted, excluding other closely related forms of music would keep some of the world's best loved favorites out of this listing. As a result, the likes of Miles Davis, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Stevie Wonder, Joan Baez, Carole King, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Robert Johnson, Count Basie, on and on.... would not be included. Some wonderful performers would, by definition, be casualties of my desire to set parameters and limits on how far this listing could reach. And indeed, I thought the failure to set boundaries was the primary reason the recent listing on VH-1 was a complete failure. And fortunately so... After starting this project two Junes ago, my heart hit the floor when I heard that VH-1 was doing a Best of Rock listing wherein the top 100 rock recordings of all time would be listed. My thunder had been stolen I fretted. How could I come out with this listing after them and not appear to be anything other than a copy cat compiler? As it would happen, however, they did me a great favor by allowing people such as Britney Spears assist in the selection making process, and for the sake of political correctness included noteworthy performers such as Miles Davis and Aretha Franklin, who, as notable as they were, had nothing to do with rock. They have their own categories founded in the blues, jazz, folk and Motown. With classical and country, I hope to someday compile top 100 listings for all the major musical forms, but not here... this is rock. This listing is not a personal pick of my favorite recordings, or the personal favorites of anyone here at BFS. Artistically, I don't care for some of the recordings chosen for inclusion, but included they were, for I consider this effort to be historical in nature, even archival, and objective in that the recordings chosen were chosen for what they meant to the genre' as a whole during it's birth, growth and maturation. In other words, what we are doing here is to report, in a manner as fairly as possible, on the recordings that formed the music which came to be known as rock music. As stated above, you will not see listed here selections from what is known as heavy metal, death metal, black metal and rap. Not that people don't listen to those forms of expression, but as we were talking to people about the recordings to be included here, and obtaining various opinions, I felt that the content of the above were not right for inclusion. The dehumanizing subject matter that is a regular part of heavy metal and rap scene has no place here. And for that matter, rock recordings delving into the satanic or dark beliefs have not been included here either. If those things interest you, go elsewhere. So, how were these recordings chosen? Billboard charts for the last thirty, or so, years were scoured to determine the impact each recording had on the buying market. People in the industry, recording and playback, were consulted and asked for suggestions. Day long listening sessions were conducted to see how the music held up today. And for me, this latter aspect of the selection process was one of the most important. Did the music sound dated? If so, it dropped in rank, which would explain why some of the Beatles and Rolling Stones recordings slipped. As notable as their recordings were, they sound dated in comparison to the recordings listed in front of them. Music is timeless, and to be included here it had better sound that way. Impact. How much did a certain recording impact the music scene at the time it was released? Also considered here, was to what extent the recording reflected the climate of the times. For those reasons alone, Sergeant Pepper's has a place in the top twenty, whereas, if the only criteria were musical accomplishment, it would probably be much lower. Did any recording reflect the rebellious spirit of the young in the late sixties and early seventies more accurately than Woodstock? That's why it is here. Musical accomplishment. For obvious reasons this criteria was the most difficult to apply, while being the most fun to contemplate and debate. And yet, along with whether or not the music retained a contemporary feel to it, the ultra subjective notion of just how \"accomplished\" the music was ultimately determined where a recording ended up on the list. One thing that we tried not to do was allow one good song on an album mean de facto inclusion here just because of that one good song. Initially, I was expecting to include many more albums from the early sixties; Turtles, Boxtops, Hollies, Dave Clark Five... stuff like that. In going over those recordings though, two things emerged: By any standard, the music sounded dated, incredibly so. By my own criteria, that wasn't good, and could not be easily overcome. The other thing that bothered me about many of the early sixties recordings was the preponderance of many to have just one extremely fine song, and seven clunkers to go with it. In some instances, two or three worthy songs would surface, with the rest being so hoaky sounding that I couldn't force myself to include the album. After all, we are looking for consistently excellent results throughout the album... not just a song or two. Another consideration was whether it was thought that another band could have made the same album, and had it come out as good or better than the original band. For example, no one could have made \"Dark Side of the Moon\", with the same mood, art and expression as did Pink Floyd. Could anyone other than the Beatles pulled off \"Sergeant Pepper\"? But that's not always the case even with what are thought to be monumental works of music. Two Stones tunes for example. It is arguable, and I believe true, that Grand Funk's version of \"Gimme Shelter\" is the better of the two. The same for Leon Russel's version of \"Jumping Jack Flash.\" And while those were actual instances of a superior remake, the thinking here was that if it seemed a band's performance in recording an album, as great as it may have been, could have been improved upon by someone else doing the same material, the original sunk. This aspect of consideration didn't really enter into the factoring until well into the list. Lastly, we did on some occasions stretch the envelope style wise where a performer was slightly something other than true rock, but still impacted the future of rock music. Joni Mitchell comes immediately to mind in this regard, as does Tracy Chapman, Peter Gabriel, Linda Ronstadt and Poco. They are here because they deserve to be even if they don't perfectly fit the mold as defined by the word \"rock\".

The conference will take place virtually from 6 to 8 July 2021 and will cover six topics related to the health and the urban environment issues: urban health inequities, transforming built environments, urban governance and public health systems, urban health over the lifecourse, climate change and urban health, urban health in Latin America and the Caribbean.     On Tuesday, June 6, 2021 at 3:30 pm , Dr. Vita \u017dlender will present a poster entitled \u00bbDevelopment of evidence-based guidelines for designing green opens spaces to promote urban health through physical activity: Experience from Slovenia\u00ab. The authors of the poster and project member of the \u00bbVen za zdravje\u00ab project (Ina \u0160uklje Erjavec, Vita \u017dlender and Jana Kozamernik) participated in the preparation of the guidelines for the Ministry of Health in 2019.     Abstract: \u00bbPublicly accessible green open spaces such as parks, playgrounds and urban forests are key environments within urban tissue for promotion of physical activity and provision of many other public health benefits, including psychological relief and stress reduction, and the mitigation of various harmful factors such as excessive heat, noise, and air and water pollution. To expertly integrate spatial planning and public health topics, the Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia (UIRS) in 2017 launched the programme entitled \u00bbVen za zdravje\u00ab (Going out to stay healthy) \u2013 Expert basis for spatial planning of green areas, aimed at promoting physical activity of citizens. The programme was based on the preparation of a comprehensive overview of diverse aspects relating to planning, improvement, and management of green areas to achieve healthy and quality living environment. Its purpose was to stimulate more quality-of-life oriented planning and development of towns and settlements in Slovenia and develop expertise for providing spatial determinants for an active and healthy lifestyles for citizens of all ages and social groups. Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of current national legislation and documents related to public health, physical activity promotion and spatial planning. We also carried out workshops and discussions with relevant public health experts, decision makers and planners. The main outcome of the programme were guidelines for green space planning to support municipalities in devising relevant approaches and promote physical activity of the population.

The development of carbon-neutral cities raises the question of which approaches can be used to ensure a turnaround with respect to such emissions so as to preserve or even improve residents\u2019 access to services in the future, thereby safeguarding their mobility. Changes in fuel consumption along with the development of information technologies in the planning, implementing, monitoring and communication with users hold the promise of playing an important role in this. Still, to achieve the ambitious goals concerning CO2 emissions and the broader impacts of traffic on the quality of urban living, these changes alone will not suffice. In the light of these goals and the newly-available technologies, cities will need to reconsider how their residents will live, work and access key services. To achieve this, balanced development will be required, together with the strong intertwining of spatial, traffic and digital accessibility.     ***     Send us your contributions for the scientific Smart Cities 2021 Conference: Activities of European Cities for Achieving Climate Neutrality, scheduled for 16\u201317 September 2021 in Ljubljana.

The event also hosted a Round table and a Group interview with stakeholders from different sectors. Since the project CREATURES wants to develop new creative and innovative tourist products, we also organized two interactive virtual Study tours (Metelkova city and Ple\u010dnik's Ljubljana).     About CREATOURES project     CREATURES project aims at preserving cultural heritage, promoting sustainable and experiential tourism in the ADRION Region by exploiting Cultural&Creative Industries\u2019(CCI) potential, finding a right balance between innovation and conservation of the Adrion rich cultural heritage.     The Project will develop actions and tools for raising competencies, support decision making processes and test the solution proposed. Bo\u0161tjan Coti\u010d is managing the project at the UIRS. (bostjan.cotic@uirs.si)     About the Urban Planning institute of the Republic of Slovenia     The Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia (UIRS) is the main national scholarly research institution in the field of spatial, regional and urban planning and related discipline. Founded in 1955 as a research and consultancy agency, UIRS was transformed into a public research organisation in 1993, a status which continues to apply to date. The UIRS currently comprises 26 researchers, four administration personnel and one librarian. The strongly interdisciplinary research group is made up of experts with a broad range of academic backgrounds.     Launch of the \u201cAlpPlan\u201d alpine spatial planning network     Sunday, January 31, 2021     Sunday, January 31, 2021 0 1480     Launch of the \u201cAlpPlan\u201d alpine spatial planning network     The OpenSpaceAlps project and the Academy for Territorial Development in the Leibniz Association (ARL) join forces to support transnational cooperation in spatial planning     The Alpine region is characterised by successful collaboration in numerous cooperation platforms. There is, though, still too little coordination between states and regions in spatial planning. This is considered crucial for tackling alpine cross-border challenges, such as ensuring ecological connectivity or managing traffic. To facilitate exchange with key stakeholders in the Alpine area, the OpenSpaceAlps project is collaborating with the Academy for Territorial Development in the Leibniz Association (ARL) to jointly establish a spatial planning network: the \u201cAlpPlan network\u201d.     The network addresses experts, planners and decision-makers at all administrative levels as well as interested stakeholders from the private sector. The aim of the network is to facilitate the transnational exchange of experience on planning practices and instruments and thus to contribute to the enhancement of spatial planning in the Alpine region.     AlpPlan network kick-off meeting yields promising results     The kick-off meeting of the AlpPlan network took place as an online conference on 29\/10\/2020. Representatives from the planning practice, ministries and academia discussed the issue of safeguarding open spaces and the future orientation of the network. The discussants agreed that the network must work in close contact with the existing cooperation formats, such as the working groups of the Alpine Convention and EUSALP. As a main benefit of the network, the participants stressed the opportunity to work together on the concrete local and regional implementation of higher-level spatial planning strategies and objectives.     Join the upcoming activities     In 2021, the network is going to host a thematic conference as well as a special capacity-building seminar. In a Memorandum of Cooperation which is being prepared the future members will agree on objectives and working procedures of the network. Moreover, an online platform and a central contact point at ARL will facilitate communication within the network.     We look forward to your participation in the AlpPlan network activities!

UIRS Connecting Nature     Monday, March 30, 2020     Monday, March 30, 2020 0 2434     UIRS Connecting Nature     Project team attended the Training Course Nature based solutions in Urban planning     The course manly focused on environmental aspects of wellbeing in the city and the potential environmental benefits that Nature based solutions (NBS) can bring. Lecturers from different research fields upskilled participants in understanding the ecological foundations of NBS, assessing their impacts on ecosystem services and applying key principles for NBS design.     Green roofs, rain gardens, community gardens and green walls are just some of the Nature based solutions (NBS) defined as \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits\u201d (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016:2).     The NBS research field is progressing rapidly, but the implementation of nature-based solutions in urban planning is still complex and often difficult process. Therefore, in February 2020 a training course \u201cNature based solutions in Urban planning\u201d was organized, at the University of Trento. The course was coordinated by the Horizon 2020 and supported by the project ReNature. Two-day training attended PhD students, post-doc students, research fellows, practitioners, as well as public officers interested in planning and designing NBS to address urban challenges. It was led by the researcher dr. Davide Geneletti, professor of spatial planning at the University of Trento, specialized in impact assessment of projects, plans and policies, spatial and urban planning, ecosystem services and multicriteria analysis.     The Course Focus     The course manly focused on environmental aspects of wellbeing in the city and the potential environmental benefits that NBS can bring. Lecturers from different research fields upskilled participants in understanding the ecological foundations of NBS, assessing their impacts on ecosystem services and applying key principles for NBS design. The teaching approach was based on interrelational lectures, discussions and case study works, conducted in groups. The following main issues were addressed:     Current thinking and experiences in European cities     Urban ecosystems, their biodiversity and functions     Mapping and assessing urban ecosystem services     Analyzing demand for NBS and potential beneficiaries     NBS design to target specific urban needs and challenges     Windows of opportunities and constraints to mainstream NBS in urban plans.     Discussion raised fruitful questions, to expose here some of the most challenging in relations planning-governance-practice-better quality living:     How do we know that NBS works better than other technically solutions of grey infrastructure, and how does the dimension of time affect the sustainability of the grey infrastructure comparing to NBS solutions?     What are the consequences of NBS for the surrounding area and can NBS also have a negative effect(s), such as rising real estate prices in the neighborhood?     How to think about the cities challenges as NBS solution?     Practical exercise     Participants were taken to a field visit in the city center, and then assigned for case studies analysis and design of NBS, considering inputs learnt at the lessons during the course. Case study work conducted in groups followed the process of, firstly identifying city challenges and secondly, proposing the appropriate type of NBS.     The main challenge of the urban planning exercise was to select 4 of the 21 sites, that are classified by the Urban Plan of the City of Trento as urban transformation sites. In the chosen sites we had to propose zoning areas, containing a new residential areas and areas with different type of NBS. The decision on the allocation of zoning areas was dependent on each group, where we had to provide an equivalent proportion of both types of areas within the total surface of the 4 areas.     The planning of NBS is supposed to take a comprehensive approach; therefore, in the area's primary proposed a residential use, our group always included the NBS.     In the Training Course, NBS were also defined within the Ecosystem services (ES) framework. The benefits of NBS planning actions were addressed in terms of changes in human wellbeing, coherently with planning goals that address the specific challenges of the city.     ES were understood as the measured benefits of NBS in terms of the increased provision of several key ES for population wellbeing e.g. climate mitigation and air purification.     We were provided with the GIS database, consisting of two types of analysis:     ES supply, which included the evaluation of the sites in terms of spatial characteristics and their ability to provide certain benefits for the wellbeing of the surrounding population.     ES demand including evaluated areas in terms of potential beneficiaries of improved environmental conditions.     Our group determined 4 areas considering the most problematic areas in terms of environmental challenges and the areas with greatest need for mitigating environmental effect in terms of wellbeing. Our planning objective derived from the analyses of the city area in the frame of mapping the provision of NBS benefits - mapping ES:     ES Air purification consider areas regarding their ability to contribute to better air quality and to remove particulate matter. ES supply analysis assesses areas regarding the different type of vegetation (trees, grass and shrubs) and their proximity to the pollution source (roads). The areas of ES demand were primarily defined as residential areas near busy roads; however, it would also make sense to identify polluted areas, used by people for recreation and socializing (e.g. public spaces, frequently used walking routes).     ES Habitat provision refers to the richness of areas with plant, animal species that are important for the ecological aspects of providing biodiversity in the city. Ecological modeling (Zardo et al., 2017) has considered the potential richness of species biodiversity, hotspots of the biodiversity in the urban area and the ecological value of river ecosystems.     ES Climate regulation refers to the assessment of areas in terms of temperature reduction capacity in Trento. The evaluation process defined the coverage of tree canopy areas and the evaluation of evapotranspiration (ratio of tree canopy cover, soil cover and area size). Areas of demand for ES has been identified in urban areas that are exposed to high temperatures and are inhabited by vulnerable population groups (e.g. children and the elderly).     Food provision ES refers to the assessment of the suitability of an area in relation to the current level of food production and the morphological suitability for agricultural activity (slope, soil and altitude). The analysis also showed areas of demand for ES, where residential areas without a private garden, were assessed regarding the distance to community gardens.     ES Noise mitigation assesses the capacity of vegetation barriers to absorb traffic noise and reduce noise pollution for residential buildings nearby. ES Noise mitigation demand refers to noise level from road and railroads (above 65dB) near residential buildings, but could also consider hospital, educational and recreational areas as a demand for noise mitigation etc.     ES Recreation assesses the areas according to their possibilities of recreation. The evaluation of potential sites was based on the structural characteristics of the area and the ability to identify areas as NBS. Accessibility and infrastructure (e.g. well-maintained cycle lanes and parking facilities) were also considered. The areas of ES demand were defined as residential areas, their assessment varied according to the distance of 300 meters (5min walk) to a quality recreational area.     Runoff mitigation evalues areas regarding the ability to infiltrate and retain stormwater, thus reducing the amount of runoff that enters the sewage system.     Assessment and indicators related to wellbeing of social dimension (e.g. social cohesion, meeting the different needs of different types of users) weren\u2019t use in this assessment, but are also important aspect in the process of spatial planning.     An example of an ES analysis Climate regulation, where a mapping of NBS contributions is mapped in terms of cooling capacity:     The advantage of the method seems to be in the understanding of the NBS as different types of solutions with different spatial components and environmental effects. Current spatial planning practices often address greenery in the city only from a structural point of view or regarding specific functions for residents (e.g. recreation), while NBS concept considers nature primarily from its processes, that can provide pleasant conditions in city.     Further discussion and dilemmas     Although the NBS and ecosystem services (ES) are relatively new concepts and most ES studies, are far from a real-life application, Geneletti (2011) acknowledges the potential of ES assessment to increase the quality of planning processes and decision.     For example, Cortinovis and Geneletti (2018) refine and upgrade the method used in the Training course. The example has not been discussed at Training Course, but it seems important to show its usefulness in real-life urban planning context:     Primer prikazuje primerjavo med obstoje\u010dimi zna\u010dilnostmi obmo\u010dja in scenarijem na\u010drtovanja novega mestnega parka.

The articles tackles specific issues and address them in the context of key topics such as: the legal and administrative frameworks of managing cultural heritage sites, management approaches and policies, and the challenges posed by cultural tourism.     The introductory article was prepared by Jelka Pirkovi\u010d, where she presents contemporary concepts of heritage management. This is followed by four articles on the challenges of managing and governing heritage sites in Slovenia. \u0160pela Span\u017eel discusses the implementation of UNESCO cultural heritage in Slovenia, and Nata\u0161a Kolenc talks about the challenges of private-public partnership in built heritage restoration. Toma\u017e Golob\u2019s article provides a theoretical overview of participatory management of urban areas of cultural heritage, using several Slovenian cases as examples, while Vlasta Vodeb reports about BhENEFIT project\u2019s best practices related to the use of historic building information modelling (HBIM) methods in managing and monitoring historic building areas.     The next four articles illustrate cases of heritage site management beyond Slovenian borders. The tone of this part is set by Helen Kendrick\u2019s article on the exceptional success of heritage-led regeneration of Glasgow, Scotland. Over the past three decades Glasgow has managed to turn its fortunes around and emerged from its industrial past to become a centre of cultural tourism. The case of Mostar and its connections with cultural tourism, boosted by its inscription on the World Heritage List, are presented in the article by Aida Idrizbegovi\u0107 Zgoni\u0107 and Jasenka \u010cakari\u0107. This monograph is rounded off with an interesting case of the mining town of Almad\u00e9n in Spain \u2013 the twin city of Slovenian Idrija in its inscription on the World Heritage List. Each year Almad\u00e9n\u2019s enthusiasts put on a show of re-enacting its history and raise awareness among the local community and the visitors regarding the significance of heritage values as the best way to promote future development of the city and the region.

OpenSpaceAlps kicks off in Altenmarkt, Austria     Thursday, December 19, 2019     Thursday, December 19, 2019 0 2713     OpenSpaceAlps kicks off in Altenmarkt, Austria     Sustainable development of alpine open spaces by enhancing spatial planning governance     OpenSpaceAlps is one of the fifteen projects approved in the frame of Call 4 of the Interreg Alpine Space programme. It brings together seven partner institutions from Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Slovenia to work on the topic of near-natural open spaces in the core Alpine and EUSALP areas. The partner from Slovenia is the Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia, Ljubljana.     The main objective of the OpenSpaceAlps project is to foster sustainable development of the Alpine area by contributing to the safeguarding of open spaces featuring environmental and natural values. In the valleys, these open spaces are decreasing due to e.g. development of settlements and transport related areas, whereas in the higher altitudes they are being dissected by tourism, forestry and agriculture related infrastructures. The path taken is to initiate and facilitate processes towards adoption of new spatial planning approaches in the alpine countries as well as to promote multi-level, transnational spatial governance.     The initial meeting of the project partners was held in Altenmarkt, Austria, on 5 and 6 November 2019. Beside discussing the first steps in implementation of the project, presentations were held about development of open space planning instruments in the Federal State of Salzburg as well as more generally in the Alpine area.

Best wishes, CS4 Organizing Committee     Environmental noise and health     Tuesday, October 1, 2019     Tuesday, October 1, 2019 0 9118     Environmental noise and health     Library of Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia, Tuesday, 15th October at 5pm, lecture in Slovene language, free of charge     Library of Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia, Tuesday, 15th October at 5pm, lecture in Slovene language, free of charge     Sonja Jeram will present the topic of environmental noise and the importance of a good soundscape in residential areas. She will explain the position of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Commission, as well as the role of the National Institute of Public Health in preparing opinions related to land use planning and action plans. She will present the level of noise pollution for traffic, industry, restaurants and wind turbines and highlight individual cases. As a contrast to noise pollution, she will also describe the role of quiet areas in the urban environment.     Environmental noise has several impacts on human health and well-being. Very loud sounds can cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment even in a short period of time. However, such sounds are not often present in the living environment. There is increasing scientific evidence of the negative effects of permanent noise in the environment even when it does not reach high intensities. Although, many people quickly get used to this noise and accept it as part of their everyday life, health effects are reflected in long-term cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that more than one million healthy life years are lost in Western Europe due to suffering from annoyance, sleep disturbance, cardiovascular disease, tinnitus and cognitive impairment in children. The data indicate the severity of the outcomes that we should not overlook.     Sonja Jeram is a researcher at the National Institute of Public Health in Ljubljana. She holds a PhD in biology from the University of Ljubljana in the field of neurophysiology in insect sound communication. She continued her work in the field of chemical safety and participated as a visiting scientist at the European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (Joint Research Centre, Ispra). For her outstanding work on alternative strategies for reducing animal use in experiments, she received the Doerenkamp-Zbinden Foundation Award. For the last ten years, she has been working on environmental noise and health also being involved in Horizon 2020 European projects.     The lecture is part of a project \u00bbExpert basis for spatial planning of green areas aimed at promoting physical activities for citizens\u00ab.     You are kindly invited to the lecture and the discussion that will follow. More info at info@uirs.si.     An uklad-based approach to protection and sustainable development of cultural heritage in Chisinau, Moldova     Wednesday, September 25, 2019     Wednesday, September 25, 2019 0 9054     An uklad-based approach to protection and sustainable development of cultural heritage in Chisinau, Moldova     Irina Irbiskaya     Library of the Urban Planning Institute of Republic of Slovenia, October 1st 2019 at 5pm, lecture in English and free of charge     Irina Irbiskaya will discuss the uklad-based approach to preservation of cultural heritage in the Republic of Moldova. An uklad is a persistent way of life \/ mode of activity which has a spatial expression. The ways uklads exist in the city differ according to the size and the role of a city (e.g. capital city, a regional administrative center or a small town). An uklad is characterized by the prevalent family culture, by its attitude to the surrounding space, by the manner in which people belonging to the uklad are aware of their past and construct their future, by how they perceive their children, how they interact with their territory and their neighbors, how they own their property and treat others' property, and by how they work and spend their leisure time. The uklad-based approach to preservation of cultural heritage is elaborated within the framework of the \u2018Russian Experts upon request\u2019 program in accordance with Partnership Framework Agreement between the Government of Russian Federation and the UN Development Program.     Irina Irbitskaya is an architect and urban planner. She is the director of the Center of Urban Competence at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) with expertise in housing projects and urban development and planning advancement. She is a co-founder of the international project Doktor Gorodov.     You are kindly invited to the lecture and the discussion that will follow.

There are currently no other plastic processing methods which could offer such wide array of products and economic advantage.     Thanks to our 20-year experience with this technology we can provide production of many different hollow products with volume from below 0.5L to 30L. The combination of our know-how and suppliers provides a proper processing of semi-products with various devices and robot technology. Furthermore, we also offer counselling in product construction or take over the complete product and tool development. With the year 2016 we now kave knowledge on suction blow molding technology, which in our technical part represents one machine with 7 ton of clamping force.     With blowing technology we can meet the highest quality demands in different industries such as automotive and appliance industries.     Blowing can be done with PE-HD and PP. However, we also have sufficient capacities and know-how to perform custom tests per customer needs. We have 9 blowing machines with closing force from 10 to 40 kN at our disposal. "

Online map background with history storage + Android phones application for free lifetime     InStock     Price 247,00 \u20ac     HOW A GPS LOCATOR WORKS     The GPS locator is able to determine its position using a sensitive GPS module. The detected location can then be sent to you via SMS message or sent to a server, where you can monitor not only the current location, but also the complete history of movement.     In order for the locator to be able to communicate remotely, it is necessary to insert a SIM card with a charged credit (with an activated data plan if you want to use monitoring via a web server or smartphone application).     USE OF LOCATOR     Thanks to its very long endurance, the locator is suitable for use mainly for tracking passenger cars. However, its dimensions are not huge, so you can place it in a child's backpack, for example, to control the movement of your child. The locator is equipped with an SOS button that your child can press in case of a problem, and you will be informed immediately.     Consumption while moving     50mA     ENDURANCE UP TO 100 DAYS     The GPS locator is equipped with a high-capacity battery, thanks to which it will last up to 100 days in operation.     SENSITIVE GPS RECEIVER     Thanks to the sensitive GPS receiver, the locator is able to reliably determine the position with an accuracy of a few meters. At the same time, it is able to update its location a few seconds after waking up from sleep mode.     TRACKING VIA MOBILE APPLICATION     Tracking with a mobile application is simple and efficient. The application allows you to view the current location, as well as the history of movement in the selected interval. The application is compatible with Android.     SMS NOTIFICATION WHEN THE BATTERY IS LOW     You will be informed about the low battery status in time via an SMS message.     LOW CONSUMPTION DUE TO SHOCK SENSOR     If the locator does not detect movement for more than 5 minutes, it will automatically go into power saving mode, in which it consumes only 2mA. As soon as the car starts moving again, the shock sensor ensures that the locator wakes up again.     WARNING WHEN MOVING     This feature ensures that you are notified immediately when your vehicle starts moving.     GEO FENCE     Allows you to set allowed or prohibited sites where the locator may \/ may not occur. You will receive an SMS notification when entering or exiting the set zone.     REMOTE EAVESDROPPING     The GPS locator is equipped with a microphone, thanks to which it allows you to listen to its surroundings. Just call the SIM card number inside the locator from your mobile phone, and you can listen immediately. Of course, the locator does not ring and answers the call automatically.

      "text":" Quality sound I expected from Sony     WI-C310 01.09.2020 od Ifishouldvewouldvecouldve     I bought a pair of Sony WI-C310\u2019s online about 6 weeks ago and I only checked them out to make sure they worked. I charged them up and let them sit idle for 6 weeks and they still have a full charge. I just put them on today and realized these headphones are top of the line. I\u2019m quick to let complaints be known but these have the right amount of bass and the sound is crystal clear. I was using Sony WI-C400 because I have 3 pair. The 400\u2019s don\u2019t compare. I\u2019ll probably get 2 or 3 more 310\u2019s soon. I\u2019ll at least get 2 more. Never know when I\u2019ll lose or break a pair and my money\u2019s low. I have to have my music everyday. Personally is the best in electronics. If you earn your money, don\u2019t cheat yourself, Sony yourself. One day I\u2019ll have a 75\u201d Sony Smart TV. Keep it up, Sony     No sound from one channel after 4 months     WI-C310 06.04.2021 od Karl2000     My wife was very happy, long lasting , confortable. Unfortunately one channel is not emitting sound anymore. Now is very complex to get in touch with customer care since it was purchased online.     Dissatisfied     WIC310\/W 23.05.2021 od Deb in Wisconsin     I bought these ear buds in March 2021. Used them for one month and the sound went out on the right ear buds. I still use them because I still get sound on the right bud, however it's very annoying.     Ease of use     WI-C310 23.04.2021 od Manalive     Very happy with the Bluetooth headphones Wi-C310.. Easy to set up. Only thing I would add is clips so they don't fall off the neck and the magnetic connection to be stronger. Overall very happy with the Sony product. Excellent quality bass sound.     Dire. Terrible microphone     WI-C310 17.04.2021 od weeboaby     I bought this a month ago and the microphone is terrible - keeps breaking up. Trying to find a way to get a repair or replacement from Sony is a nightmare.     ...     WI-C310 16.04.2021 od Bob12345678910     When I bought this at target i dont know wether or not they had to activate it but mine does'nt pair up to anything.     No sound from one channel after 4 months     WI-C310 06.04.2021 od Karl2000     My wife was very happy, long lasting , confortable. Unfortunately one channel is not emitting sound anymore. Now is very complex to get in touch with customer care since it was purchased online.     Poor Sound Quality     WI-C310 29.03.2021 od MagnusTheGreat     Everything was perfect, in terms of comfortability, battery life and design for such an affordable price. The main problem that I have to send this back is because the sound quality is poor. There is constant static noise in the headphones, especially when you listen to quiet music. I can see some other reviews having the same problem as well.     Disappointed     WI-C310 13.02.2021 od Intermediate     The mic has stopped working, so can no longer use the device to make hands free calls. Support does not list his particular problem and i cannot identify how to fix it     PRETTY GOOD FOR WHAT IT IS     WIC310\/B 28.01.2021 od RJIZZLE     For being around the $20 price range... it\u2019s definitely a good buy for a quality inexpensive gift, good for adolescents and older people who don\u2019t need expensive but want nice wireless earbuds! good for work and exercise if your worries about damaging the really expensive earbuds or headphones     Broke after a month and no way to get replaced     WI-C310 26.01.2021 od ellafalen     Bought them a few months and after a month the mic stopped working during phonecalls. Cannot seem to get a straight answer about a replacement.     Great...when they work     WI-C310 12.01.2021 od North East     Well, they were easy to use, clear sound, good range, quick charge, good battery. The microphone is somewhat misplaced (too far on the side of the neck in their suggested configuration), so I had to pin it to my shirt, where it works fine. However, one earpiece stopped working after 2 months (still under warranty, though). So, overall, they're great headphones assuming this performance issue is a fluke.     Not worth the price     WI-C310 12.12.2020 od Momma789     I paid 19.99 at Target. Half off but then saw they were cheaper at bestbuy after I returned them, No bass... sound quality could be better. When speaking on phone I could hear static. Very annoying,     Great Battery Life     WI-C310 23.11.2020 od Kishor14     Its over 2 weeks now i am using thia wireless headphones and here are the things i observed. 1- Great Battery Life 2- Decent Sound 3- No connectivity issues. 4- Cannot be used while charging 5- Battery warning are not precise     Incredibly disappointing sound quality and depth     WI-C310 22.11.2020 od Maybe7clowns     These earphones fall extremely short of the quality I have come to expect and enjoy from Sony products. The sound quality is average, and they are seriously lacking in bass. Quite disappointing as I always use Sony personal audio devices and this is the first product not to meet expectations of Sony sound quality.     Faux contact au bout d'un an     WI-C310 16.11.2020 od Nppmm     Au bout d'un an, un des deux \u00e9couteurs ne fonctionne que par intermittence. Mais garantie 2 ans donc je dois le retourner au sav. Tr\u00e8s bonne autonomie et son correct. Les aimants pour attache ne sont pas assez puissants. Il manque donc une pince pour ne pas le perdre.     These headphones are not good     WI-C310 30.10.2020 od jacki37     I cannot believe that Sony would put out such an inferior product. Bass is non-existent. Poor volume. I can barely hear the music on my Iphone X. Buyer beware, you get what you pay for.     Very poor bass quality     WI-C310 17.10.2020 od GopalKamath9705     Bought this today evening and will be returning them by tomorrow morning at the best buy store. The bass quality is very bad. Sounds like the drums are made of tin.     Na\u0161a spletna stran ni optimirana za va\u0161 trenutni brskalnik.

The project goals and partners are also briefly presented inside the project leaflet, which can be viewed in full HERE.     The activities we completed in April this year relate mainly to the report on the situation and development of additive manufacturing in the toolmaking and habitat sector, and training in these areas: high-tech T-skills and competencies in different professions (and the mismatch between needs and offered training). We have produced a report detailing the current situation in each of the countries from which the project partners come.     As can be seen from the report, the increase in the number of 3D printers in Slovenia has contributed to the emergence of many innovative companies that push the boundaries of the possible in the field of additive manufacturing solutions and create many new business opportunities.Additive technologies are written on the skin of many innovators and innovative companies in the realization of daring ideas.     In Slovenia, companies are mostly specialized in custom 3D printing and after more than 25 years of operation they don\u2019t know about the impossible challenges, despite the fact that it is necessary to invest a lot of time and effort in training employees in the field of additive manufacturing.Companies in the toolmaking and habitat sector produce both simpler and more demanding products, but they always adhere to agreed deadlines and strive for ultimate customer satisfaction.     The full report, which was created under the SAMANTHA project is available HERE. "

The equipment can be unilateral as well as bilateral. Placement on the bottom side can be done on adhesive or a classic soldering process is applied to the soldering paste. Our company offers you the assembly of prototype printed circuit boards as well as the assembly of larger batches. We equip printed circuit boards with SMD elements on two complete automated lines. We use top quality machines. We have the possibility of soldering SMD elements both in Reflow soldering furnace as well as in the condensation chamber (Vapour Phase). The method in the condensation chamber is especially useful for soldering of more demanding types of printed circuit boards, as there is no overheating of components. Soldering temperature does not exceed 230 degrees Celsius.     We offer you complete purchasing of material, making and assembly of printed circuit boards!     For any additional questions please contact us.     With many years of experience, our own development and, of course, our line of quality products, we managed to gain valuable trust of customers and clients who gladly come back.

It begins with Freud, usually with the articulation of hunger (appetite) as a basic food instinct by analogy with the sexual drive (libido), and continues with the civilizing of appetite and cultural thinking about diets (ways of eating). If these debates on instinct and sexuality are fundamental for the civilizing of appetite, the latter process is shown as a key in the formation of one\u2019s \u2018relationship\u2019 to food. Civilizing of appetite and the (culturally determined) incorporation of food do not only form a primary relationship with the nutritious aspect of food, but also generate modes of enjoyment and non-enjoyment in food. The secondary approach, which is considering food through the instrumentation of needs, desires and fantasies, is the only one that really makes an in-depth understanding of the place and value of food, in both psychical and social registry. It is necessary not to forget that the market-capitalist environment is the one that increasingly imposes rules of consumption and daily diets. Each new food experience turns out to be favorable or unfavorable beyond the mere fact that the gratification of appetite does not (necessarily) mean the gratification of appetite desires. Therefore, enjoying food becomes a modality of politics: on the one hand, the politics of flavors and, on the other hand, the politics of market and products. Since food and eating are political, and they work as a particular ideology that codetermines \u201cwhat to eat and drink\u201d it is inevitable that psycho\u2011culinary meets the concept of identity, which persists in the saying \u201cI am what I eat.\u201d     Dr. Nikola Janovi\u0107 Kolenc is a sociologist and cultural theorist, independent researcher, and Memefest collaborator. His theoretical and practical research mostly focuses on contemporary studies of culture and society, food, and issues regarding ideology theory and biopolitics.

In the background of this synergy is the belief that cooking and eating are not limited by a single human need, the need for eating, but that it is a multisensory human experience. The main purpose of this paper is to present the research findings of perception and interpretation of the flavors at the brain-activity level from the perspective of evolutionary and cognitive psychology. The author first explains the key concepts and the relationship between the molecular kitchen and neurogastronomy, followed by important findings in the neurophysiological research of flavor. The paper concludes with a critical reflection on the limits of laboratory experiments, which do not take into account many environmental factors and violate so called ecological validity.

On the Consumption of \u201cCosmo\u2011sausages\u201d     Certain nations eat certain foods with particular enjoyment. These foods are usually not eaten merely for their caloric value (if there is any), but are consumed with pride (and of course there are many who analyze and\/or caricature that pride). With these foods symbolic consumption is often more important than the physical (although we often cannot neglect their physical consumption, the paper will not dwell on this argument). One paradigmatic example of such a food is the space Carniolan sausage, which has been physically consumed (if at all) only by an astronaut with Slovene roots. All other Slovenes can only enjoy it through language. When they consume the (space) Carniolan sausage through language, they are most likely consuming that which it signifies. Carniolan sausage is probably the most common, most dominant, most satisfying (\u201cculinary\u201d) signifier of Sloveneness; it is a sort of Slovene culinary flag. But, following Michael Billig, in the case of the consumption of the space Carniolan sausage, what kind of culinary flag are we dealing with: one that is being waved or not?

The paper starts with the liminal state of the Balkan fast food in Slovenia and then analyzes innovative attempts of overcoming them by providers. These try to adapt its offer to our local tastes as well as to the change in tastes. In their attempts they are forced to compete with global fast food franchises. In spite of their innovative approaches, they are still in the liminal state that forces them again and again to invent of new flavors.     Keywords : Balkans, liminality, fast food, burek, sociology of food     The Grease Runs Through It. On Eating Ultra-greasy Bureks     Various male peer groups use a form of symbolic consumption, the topical consuming of greasy bureks, as a form of rebellion against the dominant healthy-lifestyle discourse with which they are bombarded in the media, advertising, formal and informal education. But this high-school rebellion cannot be understood primarily as an opposition to the hegemonic ideas of healthy-lifestyle discourse which holds the burek so close to its heart and often indulges in it (it particularly turns up its nose at burek\u2019s fattiness). This high-school rebellion most likely has to be understood more as a rebellion with and for the burek, and not as a clear and planned revolt against the dominant healthy-lifestyle discourse. Healthy-lifestyle discourse thus appears as an appendage, a parasite on the popular \u201ccheap and nearly always and everywhere available and satis\u201d burek, which gives further meaning and nuance to this rebellion with\/for the burek. The rebellion therefore occurs through a spectacular style, which has to be understood as intentional \u201ccommunication which in subcultures is emphasized and unusual, which calls attention to itself, which represents, overthrows and destroys the dominant meanings and uses of commodities. But of course this intentional communication\u201d\u2014at least in the case of teenagers\u2014 eating bureks has to be read as intentional at the level of the subculture. And this means that it is not done consciously or is even understood by all of the individuals in the subculture.     Burek and Social Values     The crucial function of food is to preserve life; however, food often has symbolic meaning in the society and, as such, may suggest much about culture, tradition and eating habits of a certain societies. Everyday availability and consumption of food seems natural for human beings. Because of that, we rarely think about the meanings of food within different societies. The article tries to place burek into social context and to attribute burek certain meanings which were shaped in the society. The author tries to compare meanings of burek in two different, yet also similar cultures\u2014Bosnian and Slovenian. Scientific articles on this topic have already been presented to Slovenian public, but none of them presented the viewpoints of Bosnian immigrants to Slovenia.     Keywords: burek, social values, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, meanings of the food     \u00bbAccording to Common Sense\u00ab: Gender, Nationality and Class in Cooking Show Ljubezen skozi \u017eelodec     \u00bbLjubezen skozi \u017eelodec\u00ab is the first Slovenian lifestyle cooking show hosted by spouses, publishers and foodies Valentina Smej Novak and Luka Novak. The aim of the article is to determine what gender, class and national representations are reproduced by the show. The analysis of four seasons of the cooking show demonstrates that, in regard to social class and gender, \u00bbLjubezen skozi \u017eelodec\u00ab can be compared to similar shows abroad, such as those hosted by Jamie Oliver and Nigella. Masculinity and femininity are constructed through traditional roles where the ideology of family and care for the children is vital. All this corresponds to the Slovenian socio-cultural environment characterized by Catholicism. Class identities are the reflection of Bourdieu\u2019s taste of luxury and a contemporary omnivorous taste of an environmentally conscious consumer. As for the national angle, the Central-European and partially also the French and Italian identity are stressed rather than the Slovenian one, which puts Slovenia on the socio-cultural map of the Central Europe and at the same time negates the culinary influence of the former Yugoslav republics.     Keywords: cooking, lifestyle, cultural capital, foodie, television     A Layer Cake\u2014From the Dish from Prekmurje to the Representative National Specialty     The layer cake from Prekmurje\u2014gibanica\u2014is not merely a culinary specialty. It is an immaterial culturological content moving through its physical space. The phenomenon of gibanica marks modern Slovenes at least from the 1980s onwards and was deployed as an important medium of the Slovene ethno-national emancipation and the prospect of independence. Apart of other implications, we established a working hypothesis wherein the gibanica personifies severe problems of nativeness as one of crucial implications of contemporary mono-layered societal stratification in Slovenia. Applying comparative analysis of various regional and ethno-linguistic indicators, we confirmed the initial hypothesis and, furthermore, ascertained that gibanica managed to operate not only as a regional predictor but as a social-status predictor as well. From a local class-related dessert, it evolved into a pastry of the entire population of Prekmurje only after WWII. Whereas the emergence of the recipe of the cake is not known precisely, it may be placed somewhere into the 19th century and put together with the Jewish settlement in the Prekmurje region. Today, gibanica, so much different from the layer cake of Prlekija, represents the non-negotiable boundary of the Sloveneness towards the Croatianness despite the common geographical and cultural origin.

Its theoretical framework points to food as a semiotic element, shows its relation to rituals and community, and establishes analytic distinctions between the everyday and the celebratory, sacred and profane, and ritual and routine. It then observes the integrative role of food in select family communities through the dimensions of communication, commitment, and continuity (Fiese, 2006). Based on field observations, it identifies and elaborates on two profane ritual acts focusing on food; celebratory cooking with intensive nutritional socialization and family gatherings with communal meals. It finds that the integrative role of such rituals transcends particular family communities, strengthening wider kinship groups and the idea of a nation state. It concludes with a summary of findings relating to the integrative role of food during celebratory times and considers their limitations.     Keywords: food, holidays, community, ritual     Teja Pristavec is currently a PhD student in Sociology at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, and an Excellence Fellow with the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research.

Art and\/or handicap     pp. 115-116 by Katja Sudec     Introduction     pp. 117\u2013127 by Robi Krofli\u010d     Emancipation trough the Artistic Experience and the Meaning of Handicap as Instance of Otherness     The key hypothesis of the article is that successful inter-mediation of art to vulnerable groups of people (including children) depends on the correct identification of the nature of an artistic act and on the meaning that handicap\u2014as an instance of otherness\u2014has in the life of artists and spectators. A just access to the artistic experience is basically not the question of the distribution of artistic production (since if artistic object is principally accessible to all people, it will not reach vulnerable groups of spectators), but of ensuring artistic creativity and presentation. This presupposes a spectator as a competent being who is able to interact with the artistic object without our interpretative explanation and who is sensible to the instance of otherness (handicap is merely a specific form of otherness). The theory of emancipation from J. Ranciere, the theory of recognition from A. Honneth, and the theory of narration from P. Ricoeur and R. Kearney, as well as our experiences with a comprehensive inductive approach and artistic experience as one of its basic educational methods offer us a theoretical framework for such a model of art inter-mediation.     Keywords: education, emancipation, just recognition, narrative hermeneutics, artistic experience     Prof. Robi Krofli\u010d, PhD, is an educationalist, philosopher and researcher, works as professor of educational sciences at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana.

The Actualization of the Museum     The text is about three different interventions into art exhibitions. The first approach is about an intervention at Documenta 12, questioning the possibilities of art reception and artworks through physical acting and re-acting. The second example describes a counter-reading of an exhibition through different forms of every-day knowledge: building of the 6th Berlin Biennale which showed artistic works using forms and evoking associations about squatting was counter\u2011read by former squatters. The third example is about squatting an exhibition about the issue of migration by refugees and activists. By doing an exhibition in the exhibition about their own life, they question the intention and political seriousness of the cultural institution \u2013 in this case the German Historical Museum. All three examples confront art institutions with different forms of knowledge and describe the fields of gallery education. How can we \u201capply\u201d art and what is the possibility and responsibility of gallery education to become an atelier to question contemporary society?     Keywords: community, contemporary art, critical gallery education, educational turn, gentrification, intervention, performativity     Mental Representations in Art Discourse     The paper starts by examining the content included in the museum environment, where I write about the type of relations that emerge in a museum or artistic setting. This is followed by an observation of a social act (socialising) and a chapter on the use of food in an artistic venue. At the end, I address art education via the format that I developed at the 6th Berlin Biennale. This is followed by an overview of the cognitive model of the fort-da game based on Freud\u2019s theory via two discourse models. Here, I address discourse on art works in the form of a lecture or reading, where the art space is fictitiously present, and then move on to discuss discourse on art works in real, \u201cpresent\u201d art space. This is followed by a section on actions ( Handlungen in German) and methods supporting the fort-da model. The last part of the article examines the issue of \u201cmental representations\u201d, defining and explaining the function of mental representations with regard to the target audience of the blind and visually impaired.     Keywords: discourse, intermediation, method, act (Handlung), art education setting (Kunstvermittlungs-Setting), performative thinking, mental representation     Perception as a Tool     The article presents a project of providing guidelines on art education for the blind and visually impaired, which was entitled Perception as a Tool and presented at the Berlin Biennale on 6 October 2010. It focuses on potential aspects of art education with regard to people with special needs and seeks to discover what happens with art if we cannot see it. This approach to art education combines elements of conventional tours of exhibitions and involves the participants through play. The methods that were used in our work included establishing dramatic tension and insecurity in the group as well as mutual trust by relying on different resources, including sensory perception, personal biography and different forms of knowledge and skills. A major part of the project is finding hidden, invisible or forgotten stories that are not directly linked to the exhibition and the aspects directly related to the exhibition. Such a generally inclusive approach enabled us to formulate political questions on the issue of \u2019invisibility\u2019.     Keywords: cooperation, performative, art education, exchange, inclusion, perception, blind and visually impaired, (auto)biographical, tour and experiment, irritation     Dirk Sorge is a blind artist and coordinator of the working cultural group at the Berlin\u2019s Association of Blind People.

Only the facts themselves show the true state of people whose freedom was taken from them through their handicap. Several cases from Slovenia as well as from abroad try to depict the true state without any embellishment. The facts presented, however, should serve as a reflection of what is already carried out and what should be improved in the future. It emphasizes the need to educate a new generation of special educators who should learn about the world of disabled people on the ground of new concepts that appreciate the other (or different) as a supplement of their own uniqueness or unique individuality, respectively. The author also expresses hope for the future improvements regarding the accessibility of digital media for the visually impaired on the grounds of the treaty for the blind and visually impaired, signed by the World Blind Union in Marrakesh. The Treaty obliges the United Nations to make appeal to the countries regarding the legal accessibility of digital documents for the blind and was broadly presented in Rikoss, the newspaper published by the Association of the Blind and Visually Impaired of Slovenia.     Keywords: books, fine arts, accessibility, visually impaired people, special pedagogues, treaty, legal access, digital media     The purpose of the article is to explore in what ways the visual arts (with emphasis on painting) can be brought closer to the blind in the postmodern society, in which sight is perceived to be the chief sense and in which most information is based on images. The basic methods of presenting a work of art involve the remaining senses, mostly those of hearing and touch. It is of course not enough just to deliver a factual description of a painting or to transform it into tactile graphics \u2013 more complex techniques such as audio-description, method of associations, participating in role-playing, all with the aim of a holistic experience of the work of art, must be sought instead. In the world of virtual reality, additional equipment for the blind (e.g., data gloves) provides new opportunities.     Keywords: blind persons, painting, sense of touch, sense of hearing, virtual reality     Dr. Aksinija Kermauner is tiphlopedagogue, teaching at Faculty of Education, Koper.

McLuhan's medium theory     pp. 183\u2013191 by Ana Begu\u0161     Media as Epistemological Interfaces: McLuhan\u2019s Medium Theory     The paper presents the methodological approach of Marshall McLuhan to media research, known as the medium theory. The author initially presents the key concepts of the medium theory, including the tetrad of media effects as a tool for anticipating the cultural implications of technology, and proposes the hypothesis that McLuhan understood media as primarily epistemological interfaces. McLuhan\u2019s methodological approach is then placed into a theoretical context, especially in comparison to other similar approaches (Benjamin, Flusser, Haraway). The last part of the paper presents the authors, building on McLuhan\u2019s theory (Toronto School of Communication, Manovich), and the relevance of his research today.     Keywords: medium theory, Toronto School of Communications, tetrad of media effects, cultural interfaces, digital media     Assist.

Powers     The Wheel and the Axle     Touch is the resonant interval or frontier of change and process, and is indispensable for the study of technological effects. Interface is the basis of the relationship between the visual and acoustic space. Much of present-day confusion and ferment stems from the divergent experience of the Western literate man on the one hand, and his new surroundings of simultaneous and acoustic knowledge on the other. Part of this problem stems from an inadequate understanding of the nature of the archetype. An archetype has both an overt and hidden side (figure and ground). The tetrad reveals both. The hidden effects of any archetypal situation are the aspects that truly shape our behavior. Many academic fields of inquiry have been stymied by a misunderstanding of how visual and acoustic space relate to the notions of the diachronic and synchronic. This confusion mirrors the whole disjointedness of Western education, which emphasizes left-brain over right-brain cognition, and which may be traced back to the works of both Plato and Aristotle. The tetradic analysis corrects this imbalance.

Hover the mouse pointer over a document title to show the abstract or click on the title to get all document metadata.     Record is a part of a journal     ISSN:     Secondary language     Undetermined     Title:     Archive in the Arts     The article outlines the place of the idea of archive on the conceptual map of art practices. The concept of archive has gained a lot of momentum in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, not merely as a functional tool for preserving cultural heritage but as a central issue regarding cultural memory and the understanding of, as well as dealing with, the reality. The first part of the article begins by pointing to the archaeological approach in the humanities, in the works by Michel Foucault. Next the theory of new media object by Lev Manovich is presented, which integrates the database of multimedia materials and a multiplicity, i. e. an archive, of interfaces. The technical level and the cultural level of the computer-based communication are considered. Benjamin H. D. Buchloh has introduced a distinction in the understanding of avant-garde art practices between the aesthetics of montage\/ collage and the aesthetics of archive, which does not allow for the elements presented together to create a new unified whole. The inventors of the photomontage already after 1925 turn towards a didactical curation of photographic collections thereby rejecting the effects of the shock stemming from a surprising juxtaposition. The German artists after the 2nd World War connect the archival art to the traumatic memory. The next step is the institutional critique (of the modern museum) of Marcel Broodthaers, which considers the archive as the law of what can be said (Foucault), considering the current discourses and dispositifs. Damien Hirst is also presented from the institutional-critique point of view. The nanotechnology and the contemporary digitized reality are both a sort of discursive realities, that can be construed as a dispersion of regularities that have no natural hierarchical order \u2013 the nanotechnology homogenizes the world of materials on the atomic scale, dispensing with the traditional divisions of the material world, such as organic, inorganic etc. The mediatisation of architecture and environment transforms the world into a surface of statements: the increasingly manipulated reality becomes itself a window into the cultural archive, according to Peter Weibel. The photographic reflections and their theorization by Allan Sekula are used to point to the duality of realism and nominalism in philosophy: realism of general terms is needed, unless the world disintegrates into fragmentariness of particular cases. Starting from photographs, criminology attempts to create the criminal type, whereas criminalistics nominalistically chases this particular criminal body. Lev Manovich\u2019s synthetic realism is presented as an uneven simulation of reality in new media, which makes it archive-like, a constellation of signs that represent (photo)realism. The second part of the article explains in detail Walter Benjamin\u2019s theory of the German counter-reformation Trauerspiel (mourning play) from his The Origin of German Tragic Drama (1928), and aligns it with his theory of the technical media, e.g. from his famous paper The Work Art in the Age of Technical Reproduction. The reality and the artwork are both archive-like, but not in an empirical way, starting from experience, but and archive of ruins, filed sign vehicles that have lost all their meanings. Everything is corpse-like, which ominously points towards the impending holocaust. In the conclusion of the second part of the article a moment from a digital video by Slovene video artist Sre\u010do Dragan, who together with Nu\u0161a Dragan is the author of the first video in former Yugoslavia in 1969, is analysed. Dragan\u2019s Rotas Axis Mundi (1995\/96) video deals with the war in Bosnia in a way that does not betray the victims by exploiting their suffering by making it representable, even spectacular, and integrating it into the cultural industry (as criticized by the Frankfurt School).

Using the IP address and cookies to control duplicate entries     Non-list based web surveys do not enable unique identifiers, which would enable us to control duplicate entries. Therefore, we have two alternatives, IP address and cookies, however each with certain limitations.     IP address     IP address is a number assigned to all devices logged into the network, including the respondent\u2019s device. 1KA application enables you to block duplication of IP addresses, which can prevent that the same person repeatedly responds to your survey.     This functionality can be accessed under the 'EDIT' - 'Settings' - 'Respondent access' tab. In the \u2018Block repeated IP address' category select the desired option - the block can be set to minutes - at least 10, 20 or up to 60 minutes, or to hours - for 12 or 24 hours (this option is off by default).     Limitation: The problem may occur in the case of dynamic IP addresses (dynamic IP address for the same device is changed when disconnected and restored) or in cases where the number of devices on the same network has the same IP address (eg. in organizations).     Despite these limitations, the use of IP blockage may prevent at least some of the simpler frauds like fake responses or server attacks coming from a single device.     Cookies     Cookie is asmall text file sent from the server hosting the web questionnaire, and then stored on respondent devices. Next time the respondent visits this same web questionnaire, the 1KA application recognizes this unit, which can be used to prevent repeated access or to enable proper continuation from eventual pausing or breakoff.     1KA application enables a variety of options in terms of cookies, which can be also accessed through the 'EDIT' - 'Settings' - 'Respondent Access':     'until the end of questionnaire', means that the cookie is deleted as soon as the respondent finishes answering the survey;     'Until the end of the browser session', the cookie is stored for the duration of the browser session (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera), i.e. also after the survey is completed and is deleted when respondent closes the browser;     'for 1 hour': the cookie is saved for one hour after the respondent first clicked on the survey URL;     'for 1 month': the cookie is saved for one month after the respondent first clicked on the survey URL.     You can find more about cookie settings and options for future continuation of the survey fulfilment in the Settings for respondent access: cookies and passwords manual.     Limitation: The problem with cookies is that they are tied to the browser, which means that respondent using another browser, other devices or user deleting the cookie can complete the survey again. Cookies face serious problems due to increasing ethical and legal restrictions, as well as because some users decide to block them. For these reasons cookies serve poorly as a replacement for the ID code.     In general we do not recommend using IPs and cookies for restricting access to the survey, because they can cause various expected and unexpected problems. In the default settings of 1KA application are these options usually turned off. Still, in some specific situations they can be useful, particularly if we know that in our target population none of the above problems emerge. "

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     The Decisions adopted by the Governing Board on the occasion of its 294th regular meeting on 22nd July 2004     07\/22\/2004 \/ Press release     The Decisions adopted by the Governing Board on the occasion of its 294th regular meeting: The Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia recognises that, since Slovenia\u00b4s entry into ERMII, the exchange rate against the euro has been floating around its parity, reflecting the expected changes with reference to ERMII.     On its 294th session, the Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia inter alia amended the Decision on the Narrowest Liquidity Band Which a Bank Must Provide. Since the modifications of the Banking Act enable savings banks to carry out transactions in foreign currency, the aforementioned Decision needed to be amended. Namely, savings banks had not carried out transactions in foreign currency until the modifications of the Banking Act took effect; therefore, a special Decision, the Decision on the Tolar Maturity Ladder, applied to them, requiring them to provide a lower liquidity ratio. Since the modifications of the Banking Act abolished the difference between banks and savings banks, the conditions for providing liquidity therefore have to be made equal. Furthermore, the amendment to the aforementioned Decision also enhances the set of securities eligible to be included in the first class of securities, having security or another form of State guarantee. Until now, only debt securities issued by the Republic of Slovenia have been included in the first class of the maturity ladder.     At its today\u00b4s session, the Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia also modified a Decision, stipulating the conditions for banks and savings banks to carry out banking and other financial services and documentation necessary to assist the Bank of Slovenia in ascertaining the eligibility to carry out services of this kind within the competence given by authorisation. The modifications of the aforementioned Decision thoroughly lay down the conditions to be met by banks and savings banks before starting a launch of new financial services on the market. A bank or savings bank must in writing notify the Bank of Slovenia of the aim of launching a new service or product by making a detailed plan, setting out the method of its risk management. Before launching a new service, the Management Board of a bank or savings bank has to provide adequate technical equipment, adequate manpower with proper qualifications and systems installed to monitor and manage risk. After a successfully undergone probation period, the Management Board of a bank or savings bank must adopt a Decision on meeting the conditions and notify the Bank of Slovenia thereof 14 days before starting a launch of a new service.     The members of the Governing Board were also acquainted with the renewed system of reporting on the use of modern payment instruments. A renewal of reporting is in compliance with the regulations of the European Central Bank and enables a more thorough control of monitoring new, modern dematerialised instruments and methods, as well as the occurrence of electronic money.     The Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia also dealt with the Memorandum of Understanding between the Bank of Slovenia, Ministry of Finance and Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia in the field of macroeconomic and financial statistics, regulated via the regulations of the European Union.

      "text":" Of bears and men     I recently read an article in the Delo newspaper that spoke about bears, their increasing presence in Slovenian forests, and the equally increasing need to reduce their population, i.e. the \u201cremoval\u201d of 200 bears which would make the bear population sufficiently regulated in order to decrease the number of \u201cconflicts\u201d with people.     Let\u2019s first discuss the terms in quotation marks, shall we? \u201cRemoval\u201d is only a preferred term for shooting or killing 200 bears in one year. \u201cConflict\u201d, meanwhile, actually means \u201cconflict of interests\u201d, namely when it comes to human interests compared to interest of the bears. This conflict is particularly obvious in spaces that have always been the habitats of bears but where sheep, goats, and other livestock are bred nowadays without actually belonging because mankind brought them there. This conflict is not a \u201cSlovenian invention\u201d; rather, it represents the universal state of the relationship between the natural habitats of wild animals and the intervention of mankind into such environments. Therefore, it is not surprising that, among mammals alone, the number of undomesticated wild animals plummeted from around 40% to no more than 4% and is, of course, still decreasing. People and all sorts of our livestock represent the remaining mammal biomass on Earth. All large wild animals are nowadays being replaced by sheep, goats, cows, pigs and, naturally, nearly 8 billion representatives of our species uncontrollably roaming around Earth. Biodiversity is being replaced by biological uniformity.     In Slovenia, we have quite a number of bears; the number of our wolves is also growing steadily, and my colleagues are currently trying to genetically enrich the sparse lynx population by importing about a dozen lynx from Romania and Slovakia. I am very familiar with the biologists working to address the issue of \u201cthe big three\u201d (bears, wolves, and lynx), which is why I also know they are highly professional people striving to keep these majestic animals alive for posterity. But virtually all of them are also speaking in favour of shooting bears and also wolves, claiming that it would contribute to a \u201csuitable\u201d control of the population of these beasts. I know that their decisions are constantly influenced and conflicted by the requests of nature conservationists, the livestock sector of the agricultural lobby, and local inhabitants, as well as by political demands. As experts, they are treading a fine line between the well-being of wildlife and the request to interfere with the environment for the profit of humanity.     Admittedly, I am not an expert in dealing with these questions myself; I know enough about ecology, however, to be able to safely say that shooting 200 bears in one year is an exaggerated feat. The bear and wolf population could be controlled by using different approaches; for example, we could stop feeding wildlife \u2013 not only bears, but also deer. Of course, I understand that a completely natural environment can no longer be found anywhere and that even the carrying capacity (in this case, available food) of a seemingly preserved wilderness cannot completely regulate the population of undomesticated animals. It is also true, however, that nobody has ever tried it so far; at least not in Slovenia. It is far easier to simply shoot an animal, especially if one can also make a profit doing so; the hunters know that well. And here we are, back at the beginning of the story. We feed wild animals to be able to sell them and earn something by killing them.     I remember a similar story from Namibia where the authorities decided to allow a couple of older males of the otherwise critically endangered black rhino species to be shot. The shooting price was of about 100,000 bucks. The reasoning behind the shooting was that the money collected will go towards the protection of the black rhinos. Actually, it's a story similar to our bear-related experience: we protect them by killing them and earn some money in the process. Not bad, eh? It is entirely possible that I am naive and therefore do not understand the calculation, but maybe that\u2019s a story for another blog.     Oh, and one more thing: I think I have only seen a bear in its natural habitat once in Slovenia, when my colleague Ivan Kos took me near a den that a mama bear and her two cubs came out of. It all lasted for about two minutes and I was so fascinated with the scene that I simply forgot to take photos, which is why I cannot provide my own photo of a bear to go with this blog. Meanwhile, it is virtually impossible to see a wolf or a lynx in the wild and to take photos of them. Well, allow me a pinch of self-criticism: it is also true that I\u2019m a city guy and that it\u2019s impossible to meet a bear in Ljubljana, unless you go to the zoo (even though there was one at Ro\u017enik once). Unlike the people who live in the natural habitat of bears. They, too, must be understood.     Dr. Tom Turk     Dr. Tom Turk is a professor of biochemistry at the Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana. He is a biologist and an author of books about life in the Adriatic Sea and Mediterranean Sea, traveller and nature photographer who, every now and then, still dives below the sea surface and takes an underwater photograph or two. He is especially interested in nature protection and conservation of biodiversity. He\u2019s also a member of the editorial board of the Slovenian edition of National Geographic. "

      "text":" Often unfolding in public spaces, Veli & Amos's interventions range from graffiti to billboards, conceptual street art actions, rap, and animated films. Their documentary art road movie Style Wars 2 is an example of a work meshing all of the above. A few years ago, the artists saw posted on the Internet the graffiti \"Style Wars 2\" painted on a subway car, and decided to try and track down the author. Their five-year exploration of today's graffiti and street art took them on a journey from Europe to the United States and the Middle East, from galleries to war zones. Marked by pop culture iconography and characteristic artistic distance, the film is an extremely communicative present-day reference to the cult documentary Style Wars (1983), in which Tony Silver zoomed in on the New York breakdance and graffiti scene of his time.     Veli & Amos is a Swiss-Slovenian artist duo working between Ljubljana and Z\u00fcrich. Veli Silver was born in 1983 in Banja Luka, and Amos Angeles in 1986 in Z\u00fcrich.     The Draught exhibitions series is curated by Igor \u0160panjol. "

      "text":" Pierre Mechain was born on August 16, 1744 in Laon. He was son of an architect, and originally wanted to follow his father in a career in architecture. He studied math and physics, but due to financial difficulties left college. For some time, he worked as a tutor. Then he became friend of Jerome de Lalande, who let him proof-read parts of his book \"L'Astronomie\". In 1772, Lalande obtained a position for Mechain as assistant hydrographer at the Depot of Maps and Charts of the Navy in Versailles. In the beginning, this was only a temporary position, and Mechain was forced to get additional income from teaching mathematics.     In 1774, Mechain obtained the more permanent post as a calculator with the Depot of the Navy. At that time, he has met Charles Messier, who worked for the same department, but at the small observatory at Hotel de Cluny. Apparently, the two astronomers became friends around this time.     On the new post, Mechain was first involved in surveys of the French coastline. In addition, he had occasion to make some observations at Versailles. In 1774, he observed an occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon, which he later presented as a memoir to the Academy of Sciences.     Like Messier, Pierre Mechain became much devoted to comet observing and hunting. Also like Messier, he soon started to stumble over nebulous objects, and between 1779 and 1782, discovered the considerable number of 30 deep sky objects, 29 of which were original firsts. As apparently he had got in close cooperation with Charles Messier at that time, he almost instantly communicated his observations to Charles Messier, who usually checked their positions and added them to his catalog. Both astronomers undertook a vigorous effort to find more nebulae between late August 1780 and March 1781, when the manuscript for the final version of the Messier catalog was sent out to print. Mechain's last two contributions, M102 and M103, went into the publication unchecked and without positions.     Four additional findings of Mechain missed the publication; these are now known as M104, M105, M106, and M107. He communicated them to Bernoulli, the editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch, in a letter dated May 6, 1783. As these four objects were not contained in the original Messier catalog, they were longly attributed separately to Pierre Mechain (e.g. by John Herschel and J.L.E. Dreyer, the author of the NGC). In this same letter, Mechain disclaimed - possibly in error - his discovery of M102 as an erroneous re-observation of M101, thereby initiating a still open discussion on the identity of this object.     Mechain discovered his first two comets in 1781, and because of his mathematical skills, he was able to calculate their orbits. He was made a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1782. A third comet followed in 1785, and in 1786, he discovered another one which later became famous as \"Comet Encke\" (after the calculater of its orbit, the German astronomer J.F. Encke). Comet Encke was later independently rediscovered by Caroline Herschel in 1792 and by Pons in 1805, and is the shortest-periodic comet ever discovered, with a period of 3.5 years.     In 1786, Pierre Mechain became an associate editor of the Connaissance des Temps, the journal which had e.g. published the Messier Catalog - one year after Charles Messier had been appointed for the same job.     In 1787, Mechain collaborated with J.D. Cassini and Legendre on measuring the acurate longitude difference between Paris and Greenwich. All three visited William Herschel at his observatory in Slough in the same year.     Mechain discovered his fifth comet in the same year, 1787. His next, 6th discovery occurred in 1790; this finding was periodic comet Tuttle with a period of 13.75 years, as recognized by Tuttle in 1858.     In 1791, a project was initiated of a new survey of the meridian from Dunkirk to Barcelona, and Mechain undertook the southern part, together with an assistant, Tranchot. The operation started June 25, 1792, suffering from various difficulties caused by the French revolution: At one time, Mechain and Tranchot got arrested by revolutioneers in Essone, who first mistook their instruments as weapons, but later let them proceed.     When in Spain, Mechain got hurt in an accident, and when he had recovered, war had broken out between France and Spain, and he got interned. Nevertheless, he discovered another comet, his 7th, from Barcelona on January 10, 1793. During the terror regime in Paris, while Mechain himself was away, all of his property got lost, and his family suffered greatly. Mechain was eventually allowed to leave Spain for Italy, where he stayed at Genoa for some time, and returned to Paris finally in 1795.     On his return, he bacame member of the new Academy of Sciences, and the Bureau of Longitudes. Moreover, he was made director of the Paris Observatory, where he discovered his 8th and last comet on December 26, 1799; Messier took part in observing this one in order to obtain its orbit.     Apparently, Mechain was concerned about the quality of the results of his survey, and refused to publish them for a long time. Eventually, he got permission from Napoleon to extend the survey, and left Paris in 1803.     After completing part of this work, Pierre Mechain caught yellow fever and died in Castillion de la Plana in Spain on September 20, 1804.     Mechain originally discovered 29 deepsky objects, all of which are contained in the modern-version Messier catalog, plus 4 independent co-discoveries; of these he disclaimed one (M102). The four objects which missed the original publication of the Messier catalog, M104, M105, M106, and M107 were eventually added by Camille Flammarion in 1921 (M104) and Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947; the two mentioned with M97 (M108 and M109) by Owen Gingerich in 1953.

      "text":" History     Antiquity, ancient Romans, Atrans     In different historical periods, Trojane was always an important spot for ancient travellers on the road from the middle to the eastern part of Slovenia (looking at the borders as they are today). Ancient Romans who travelled from Emona (today's Ljubljana) to Celeia (today's Celje) and onwards to Petovia (today's Ptuj) established their army and post office there. They named it Atrans. The oldest known written record mentioning the present name of the place goes back to 1229. Coins with the images of Roman emperors` (Comodus, Domitian, Hadrian) are a small part of the rich archaeological findings in Trojane.     At the time of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, before the railway line Vienna - Zidani most - Ljubljana - Trieste was built, there was a well-used road. The road was named the \"Old Vienna road\" by the native people and it connected Celje via Trojane and \u00c8rni graben with Ljubljana and Trieste. Along that road, locals built a great number of two-storey carter houses, relatively large for that period, with a tavern on the ground floor, accommodation above, big stables for horses and warehouses for storage. Old written records from 1826 tell us that the owner of the majority of such carter buildings around Trojane was Toma\u009e Kotnik (an ancestor of the Konj\u009aek family).     The Konj\u009aek family, the first bus link     Among all the buildings in Trojane which still serve their original purpose today, there is one, proudly showing its construction year which goes back to 1849. The year is engraved in a stone plate and fixed above the main entrance. The building belongs in the treasury of national immovable heritage and has been placed under monument protection. Credit for such classification of this impressive building goes to the first members of the Konj\u009aek family. In the years between 1911 and 1913, the landlords formed a union, organised as a shareholders' company, and invested in the purchase of three buses (Zaurer brand) from Vienna in 1913. Among the shareholders was Franci Konj\u009aek, father of Gregor Konj\u009aek. In the same year, the first two buses began carrying passengers to Trojane. The company bought the buses to establish a connection between Ljubljana and Celje. One bus ran from Ljubljana to Celje, the other went from Celje to Ljubljana. Both buses met at Konj\u009aek`s in Trojane at 8-a.m. and continued their way after a short stop for refreshment and a snack for the passengers. In the afternoon, both buses returned. The third bus was just a reserve in case of problems with the other two. It is interesting to note that the bus journey on the macadam road between Ljubljana and Celje took three hours. The first two buses came to Trojane in the year 1913. In 1939, a boarding house was built in Trojane - the Konj\u009aek hostel. Beside the hostel there was also a petrol station for the buses and infrequent cars.     Recent history, the 1950's and the late 20th century     After World War II the People's Republic of Yugoslavia accomplished the nationalisation of all private properties. No one was spared, not even the Konj\u009aek family. They had to incorporate all their properties into the Trojane Agricultural Co-operative, just like other local farmers. In July 1959, the co-operative opened the restaurant \"pri Kon\u009aku\" and revived activity in Trojane. Rajka Konj\u009aek was in charge. At the beginning, there was only one employee working in the restaurant. The traffic became heavier and tourism began to develop, so the Trojane restaurant, with its special position, expanded quickly. In 1959, the road was finally tarmaced. Accommodation called 'rooms for foreigners' was built in 1959-60. By that time, there were 18 people working for the company. In October 1960, the catering industry was separated from the co-operative and began to work independently. That year was a special landmark in the company's history, as it is was considered to be the year of establishment of the company as it is today. Soon after, in 1961, the company started to produce the famous dessert 'Trojanski krof ' (Trojane doughnut), well known in Slovenia and most of Europe, just occasionally at first, but since 1962 on a regular basis. Finally, here is a short summary of the events in the last decade of the 20th century, which were important for the company. In 1992-93 the company's administration successfully accomplished negotiations on the denationalised property of the Konj\u009aek family. To the satisfaction of both sides, they agreed on a settlement and a pay-off . In 1994-96, the right of ownership was settled, and in September 1996 the company was registered as a shareholders' company.     Trojane doughnut     Our famous doughnuts deserve to be mentioned separately, because they also carry the name of Trojane across Slovenian borders.     Certifikat SQ     We pride ourselves on the SQ certificate - Slovenian Quality Product-for our own Trojane doughnut, of which we are very proud.     Ecology     In the restaurant company trojane a lot of attention is also devoted to obtaining green energy and use of green energy. "

Gear inspection is 30 times faster with form measurement     Meltham Mills Engineering (MME) has adopted a new inspection philosophy to control their manufacturing, which has brought significant time savings. It now takes only eight minutes to inspect every critical feature on a typical component, compared to four hours previously \u2013 30 times faster.     Simultaneously, data is gathered on the form of features, the first time MME has had this automated capability. This has been made possible using Renishaw's SP25 scanning probe fitted to a new Mitutoyo Crysta co-ordinate measuring machine (CMM), allowing continuous measurement data to be captured along 3D profiles.     The purchase of this new measurement equipment is one result of MME's strategic review of its overall manufacturing operation, which is transforming a traditional machining company into a business better placed to meet the demands of a rapidly changing market. MME is not only reducing costs but also adding value where customers need it, and achieving faster response times and sustained levels of quality. MME has a long history of producing gears and associated components but have realised that new technology and thinking must be used to remain competitive, but used cost-effectively, not just for the sake of it.     Traditional inspection methods are very good at measuring the size and relative position of a feature, but the performance of a component in use is often determined by any deviation in shape or surface profiles. With gears, if the correct profile is achieved the teeth will mesh correctly, resulting in smoother running and less wear. Therefore having the ability to rapidly measure the form of the teeth profiles and feedback any variation to control the process has significant benefits.     One-stop shop for gear production     MME now believes strongly in having capability in-house for all the processes involved in gear production. The forgings are bought in at very competitive prices from overseas with all subsequent operations, the real value-added processes, closely controlled.     Turning is done first, followed by gear cutting, milling, heat treatment, grinding and final inspection. Between each of these production processes the relevant features are subject to sample inspection on the CMM, carried out by the machine operators themselves. This is an important change in working practises; the operators take full ownership of the quality of their work, with traceability back to a calibrated standard via the CMM.     MME is also a specialist in heat treatment, and currently uses the SP25 to scan the component form to determine how much grinding is required after this process. MME also plans to use the SP25 to provide customers with information that predicts the changes taking place during heat treatment, which can then be used to redefine the machining tolerances prior to treatment, reducing distortion and waste, and reducing overall cost.     Simple measurement programs     Nigel Peace, the production engineer responsible for these changes, has been given the role of Process Control Co-ordinator, demonstrating how MME views inspection and quality control as the control system for the whole manufacturing process.     Mr Peace programs the CMM using CAD models, where available, creating programs where the measured points and motion of the probe stylus is visualised on a 3D CAD model. This programming is done such that the machine operator can run through a series of step-by-step instructions, positioning the component in the right place on the machine bed, then running the rapid inspection cycle in a matter of minutes. The operator must use a specific password to start running the job and any measured data is automatically recorded against the specific component and batch.     Immediate visual check of profile tolerance     The inspection program immediately produces a plot of measured points, showing the deviation from the nominal line of the gear profile, and how that deviation compares to the upper and lower tolerance limits set by MME and its customers. Machine operators can see immediately whether there are any imperfections along the length of the gear surface, or indeed any other critical surface.     Nigel Peace is delighted with the new CMM and probe system \u2013 \u201cThis system is taking measurements we couldn't even dream of before. We used to subcontract out the inspection of any difficult component, which cost a fortune and added days, if not weeks, to the overall production time. Our manual CMMs and shadow-graphs were capable of less complicated measurements but still took hours compared to the minutes taken now.\u201d     How the Renishaw SP25 works     The Renishaw SP25 is different from the original Renishaw touch trigger probes such as TP2 and TP6, fitted to thousands of CMMs worldwide. It is a miniature 3 axis machine in its own right, capable of measuring the deflection of the stylus tip in any 3D direction.     The CMM is programmed to drive the stylus tip of the probe across the surface of the part, maintaining a constant probe deflection normal to the surface. If this deflection changes, the software adjusts the direction of travel to regain the constant deflection. At the same time, data is gathered at a rate of up to 2000 points a second, both from the three axes of the probe and the three axes of the CMM. This continuous stream of data would be impractical to gather using touch trigger probes.     The net result is that a large number of 3D points can be used to construct a 3D surface or profile in a matter of seconds, which when compared to a CAD surface or profile, immediately highlights any deviations.     A key feature of the SP25 is the ability to change between different styli during an automated cycle, which MME uses during the measurement of a number of parts. The different styli are mounted on modules with repeatable mounting joints, so that when the modules are attached to the probe body, the ball on the end of the stylus is back in the same position to within a fraction of a micron of the position in the which the ball was calibrated.     Modules are changed several times during certain inspection cycles, so that, for example, a longer stylus can be used to access the lower teeth of a double gear, or a smaller ball used to measure a small diameter hole. The time to change between modules is a matter of seconds using the automated change rack. "

In line with Directive 2010\/53\/EU, she has been appointed responsible physician for the donor programme in Slovenia. Within the Eurotransplant international foundation for organ exchange, of which Slovenia has been a member state since 2000, she is a Board member (since 2016) and member of the advisory Ethical Committee (ETEC, since 2014).

Hospital transplant coordinators     In every donor centre, there is a hospital transplant coordinator, who closely cooperates with central transplant coordinators and Slovenia Transplant.     Hospital transplant coordinators are experienced physicians, who perform this function alongside their regular work in the donor hospital. When a patient has been definitively diagnosed as brain dead, hospital transplant coordinators discuss the possibility of organ and tissue donation with the deceased person\u2019s closest relatives or friends and obtain their consent to donation or refusal. They provide psychological support to the family and friends and are available for possible questions regarding further donation procedures.     List of hospital transplant coordinators, appointed by decision of the Minister of Health of RS (status on 1 April 2020):     University Medical Centre Ljubljana: Rade Stani\u0107 MD, MSc     University Medical Centre Maribor: Tanja Kuprivec MD     Central transplant coordinators     Central transplant coordinators play a key role in the process of deceased donor organ and tissue donation and transplantation in Slovenia and in the Eurotransplant region.

Rolji\u0107 concluded the event with the thought that ideas should be realised right away instead of being put off until tomorrow, and that it might just happen that you will not always be the best at something, but that it is therefore all the more important that you give it your best shot.     Part of the event was also a panel on the particularities, similarities, and differences between Slovenian, Austrian, Czech, and Hungarian ecosystems. The discussion was moderated by the ABC Accelerator\u2019s Jakob Gaj\u0161ek, while guests included Eva Rez (Day One Capital, Budapest), Andrej Kiska (Credo Ventures, Prague), and Markus Lang (Pioneers Ventures, Vienna).     All the startups will now tackle new challenges, as will the ABC Accelerator team, which is about to start preparations for its new and redesigned programme. In October they will welcome 10 of the best \u201cDeep Tech\u201d startups, who will work and accelerate for at least a month in Silicon Valley as part of the three-month-long programme. They will accelerate even faster than before as they focus on products pertaining to blockchains, artificial intelligence, big data, and analytics. "

Together with their product development and planning services for the most demanding plastic injection moulds, TECOS are creating an integrated range of services, supported by state-of-the-art technologies.     The construction of plastic products is a complex task involving a number of factors linked to the list of final product requirements, which also answer the questions:     How is the product used?     How does it fit into other parts of the whole assembly?     What kind of stresses will occur when using?     In addition to the functional and structural parameters, the process parameters play an important role in the design of plastic parts. They answer questions about how the polymer melt enters, fills and cools down in the mould cavity, its deformations, the orientation of the fibres, and what visual and mechanical changes in the properties can be expected, as these play a key role in the final properties of plastic products.     Our experienced experts, the use of cutting-edge simulation tools and our own testing and prototype equipment provide our customers with state-of-the-art moudls with the fastest possible cycles, optimal material consumption and exceptional surfaces. At the same time, in keeping with the sustainability of our operations, we strive to minimise energy consumption. "

Commission report on AMR     The European Commission published its 5th progress report on the implementation of the European One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). FVE welcomes the report and especially the One Health approach in addressing AMR. The key objectives of the plan are: making the EU a best practice region; boosting research, development and innovation as well as shaping the global agenda. The progress report put emphasis on three main actions at EU level:     - The F2F target aiming to reduce by 50% the overall EU sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals by 2030: it will be supported by the implementation of the recent Regulations on Veterinary Medicinal Products and on Medicated Feed for which implemented and delegated acts are currently being drafted.     - The new Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020\/1729 on the monitoring and reporting of AMR in zoonotic and commensal bacteria;     Fur farming in Europe     A webinar co-hosted by Eurogroup for Animals, Human Society International\/Europe and Fur Free Alliance in collaboration with the European Parliament\u2019s Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals was delivered in the wake of COVID-19 outbreaks on mink farms throughout Europe. The meeting looked at the health and welfare issues around the farming of fur animals. Animal welfare organisations call for the permanent closure of fur farms in Europe. Culling across Europe continues in a bid to control the virus but there is concern that farms that have been shut down will restart in countries that are yet to ban fur farming.     BreedersTalkGreen     Francesco Proscia and S Moody attended the first webinar in a series from EFFAB and FABRE-TP on new animal breeding techniques and their positive impact on sustainability of the livestock sector. EFFAB represents the EU animal breeders\u2019 associations. Gene-editing techniques are currently used and can be further improved to select livestock able to emit less greenhouse gases, convert feed more efficiently and achieve higher health-performance indexes (e.g., fertility and resilience). Most of the speakers agreed on how climate action as a breeding goal requires a multi-faceted approach: efficient use of feed, optimal survival rates, good quality products, robustness to handle different qualities of feed and fluctuations in environmental conditions.
