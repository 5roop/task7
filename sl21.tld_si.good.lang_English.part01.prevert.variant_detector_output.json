By using an innovative model, an increase in the institutional capacity of public institutions for social and employment services will be achieved through social activation and the strengthening of mutual partnerships. In the cross-border area, the project can be performed as the first in practice proven social activation, which is crucial for the transformation of the work of Social Work Centres and Employment Services as key public institutions for changing the existing situation. Outputs:     Strengthening partnerships between public social activation bodies in the cross-border area,     Improving institutional capacity through the 2SoKroG model,     Transforming the 2SoKroG model into practice and raising public service quality levels in the field of social activation,     Improving knowledge and skills for staff in the field of social activation.     An innovative approach to use of social activation model in public authorities leads to rise of different functional competencies and skills, potential for a reintegration of vulnerable groups into the labour market, integration into the various social systems and, consequently, affects health improvement in the cross-border peripheral area, which reduces the use of social transfers and increases their effectiveness.

        "text":" Information security standards in payment card industry     Abstract     Data security is an important activity in many companies, especially if they operate in an environment with sensitive data. To facilitate the implementation of data security measures, a variety of standards, frameworks and best practices are available as a guidelines according to which a company can or must act. These standards can be different in their requirements, while some of their requirements and chapters can be similar. This work examines theoretical background of information security in the processing of payments, while selected standards and frameworks that help to safeguard information are also analysed. The case of implementation of the standard PCI DSS and ISO\/IEC 20000 using ITIL in companies in the business of processing payment transactions is presented. Additionally, implementation in cases of risk and vulnerability, modelled in the ArchiMate language, is also demonstrated. The main aim of the master thesis is to examine how the company could at minimum cost and use of various sources implement standard ISO\/IEC 27001 on the basis of what is already available from the standards PCI DSS and ITIL. For this purpose, the master thesis reviews, compares and conducts mapping of various requirements between those standards. On this basis, the concept of the implementation model of ISO \/ IEC 27001 with the integration of the PCI DSS and ITIL is developed. Through this model, companies could lower their costs and more easily implement the new standard as well as reduce the level of risk. The conclusion of the thesis offers overview of the findings and suggestions for further work. In this master thesis knowledge acquired in postgraduate study of Information Systems and decision-making at the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science is used. Moreover, this thesis makes use of the knowledge and experience gained from my work in the field of software development, in particular web applications and web services, as well as the implementation of safety standards in the network which is discussed in this thesis. In addition to this, domestic and foreign scientific, technical articles, conference contributions, standards and frameworks are used as a relevant knowledge sources. "

What makes us tick, what we have in common with AI machines, and what makes us different. How wise leaders use their brains differently, concluding with some practical ways to \u2018wise up our brains.\u2019 Here we present the full article.     As digitization and AI stream into almost every aspect of our professional and personal spaces, we could argue that it\u2019s too important to leave in the hands of specialists, says Job Voorhoeve, Leader of the Amrop Global Digital Practice. As executives, we all owe it to ourselves and our organizations to raise our digital literacy \u2014 to learn and understand.     This article clearly demonstrates our potential to do that. Yes, AI machines can learn. But millions of years of evolution have ensured that the human brain is unmatched. Not only in its constant adaptation to new information, but in understanding the reasons why. And if we cultivate our neuroplasticity throughout our careers, we are never too senior to learn.     CIOs might disagree. They tell us that their role is all too often misunderstood, even by their boards. If we have an enormous potential to learn from each other, then it has yet to be fulfilled, it seems.     CIO\u2019s and their non-digital counterparts have a major opportunity to learn from each other. To share perspectives. And this has important implications for digital leaders. To foster a digital learning organization that supports the \u2018digital neuroplasticity\u2019 of the organizational brain, the CIO needs to master four domains1. Technical and strategic acumen, certainly. Digital organization-building, undeniably. But the fully actualized digital leader must also be able to foster a digital culture.     It is in this cultural dimension that organizational learning sits, in the CIO\u2019s ability to install a growth, rather than fixed, mindset (as proposed by Carol Dweck), to cultivate digital agility, nurture talent and foster collaboration. And to make wise decisions.     How can we model the wise digital leader? We define a clear set of characteristics. S\/he skillfully resolves ESG dilemmas (for example, \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018wealth\u2019). S\/he fosters ethical, responsible and sustainable digitization. S\/he not only enlightens the organization and its performance, but also addresses the concerns of the wider business community, encouraging new heights of moral excellence.     Covid-19 has driven home the importance of four-dimensional digital leadership. It has catalyzed \u2018forced learning\u2019, pushing organizations to embrace virtual management strategies as never before. Yet the risks of this are only now emerging: the erosion of personal, live interaction, the water cooler encounters, the social dance so vital for wellbeing and innovation. How to balance virtual with physical? How to transform data into information? We are still learning.     If four-dimensional digital leadership is vital, it\u2019s elusive. Such leaders are in demand. Perhaps no single person in your organization embodies all four dimensions. One solution is to build carefully selected digital teams, giving a multi-dimensional interplay of brains.     For this, the best talent management strategists \u2013 indeed any executive with a hiring responsibility - place digital search, assessment and training at the center of the agenda. They engineer the learning bridge between the technical domain and the other organizational spaces into which it flows.     This work by Amrop guest writer Dr. Peter Verhezen is both fascinating and informative. Whether you are a digital native, or affected by digitization, I warmly recommend it. We have so much to learn!

        "text":" Environmental health     An article posted by Anne Godfrey, Chartered Institute of Environmental Health on 02 September 2016 \u2013 Follow the link     Environmental health has been defined in a 1999 document by the World Health Organization (WHO) as:     Those aspects of the human health and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially and affect health.     Hygiene of facilities and processes     Health risk factors have to be managed indoor and outdoor where people live, work and spend their free time. Among other qualifications sanitary engineer is also qualified for hygienic analysis and solving hygiene problems in different facilities and working processes. Especially in facilities that are important for maintaining health throughout the life cycle of man (Health facilities, kindergartens, schools, food industry, homes for the elderly, laundries, etc.). In this context, we pay the attention to the elements and methods of technical and hygienic management of buildings and processes in different environments and circumstances.     Risk assessment and risk management     Understanding the risks to human health is one of the most important challenges in the field of public health. That is why the risk assessment has been rapidly developing in the last 30 years. Risk assessment is a significant segment of identifying and studying risk to health and environment. It is extremely interdisciplinary work, involving different experts including chemists and biologists, doctors, statisticians, physicists, and sanitary engineers. Primarily, the approach of risk assessment, was developed for the evaluation of risks to human health due to exposure to chemicals. During the development, the use of the risk assessment was successfully extended to the segment of the environmental impact. In addition we can also assessed exposure to a physical or (micro) biological risk factors. If the risk assessment confirms that the risk exists, it is always followed by the next step, management, control and reduction of risk (Polj\u0161ak and Jereb, 2012).     Emergency situations     At the large-scale natural disasters (floods, devastating earthquake, storms, epidemics of infectious diseases and other cases), the affected community is faced with the so-called emergency situations. Emergency situations arise when there are (usually suddenly) the disproportions between the needs of the group of people and ability to manage that needs at the affected area (Macarol-Hiti, 2000). Organization of work in this circumstances is the most essential component of the protection and rescue. It ensures simultaneous and efficient work of various departments. Of course, in order to, as far as possible, minimize the consequences of each accident, and especially to prevent or minimize human casualties (Poor, 2006). From the sanitary point of view it is necessary in an emergency, especially when it is required the relocation of people from vulnerable places, to implement technical and hygiene measures such as:     Sodelovanje sanitarnih in\u017eenirjev na strate\u0161kem forumu mednarodne revije Environmental Health Perspectives https:\/\/t.co\/qnLSbth7k6 "

        "text":" Category: Windows     If someone has a problem with activation of Windows server 2019 Standard Evaluation edition, maybe I can help someone with my post. When I tried to activate the server, I received the error code 0xC004F069. Searching for this code on internet, I received many explanations like problems with KMS server, not accessible thru internet and so one. Of course, no one of this errors was the right error and I had to do my research. The problem in this case is Evaluation edition and you have to solve this issue as first. To do this you have to change the scope of server using DISM command: DISM \/online \/set-edition:serverstandard \/productkey: N69G4-B89J2-4G8F4-WWYCC-J464C \/accepteula \u2013 this key is GVLK Key! This example is for Standard edition. Be aware that as product key you must use GVLK Keys! If you need to know to which edition you can change, use the command Dism \/Online \/Get-TargetEditions before you specify eddition in previous command After this (you will see a progress bar with installation) you need to reboot the server. When the server will come back, you can activate it with your key: Slmgr -ipk:YOUR-KEY Slmgr -ato Hope that I helped someone. Let me know.     In past I already wrote about resetting Administrator password in this post. That was perfect for Windows 10 (till 1903) and Servers 2012 and 2016. Probably Microsoft was not really satisfied that users were able to \u201crecover\u201d lost passwords in such an easy way (this is my opinion). It is OK if these steps are used to reset your lost password, but not if you use them to reset a password from a stolen computer.     I think that this is the reason that you cannot rename cmd.exe in other executables and run it before you log in \u2013 for example to change the password. It makes sense, it is perfect for me as it is more secure. But someone forgot something: it is not a requirement to open CMD to use NET USER command, you can do it from PowerShell as well \u2013 and it\u2019s working also in Server 2019!     Here are the steps (they are very similar as previous steps):     Boot from DVD \u2013 you need to access to Windows system drive offline \u2013 installation DVD has all tools that you need.     From menu select Repair your computer. This will give you the ability to change some files.     In the next menu select Troubleshot.     Select Command prompt. This is what we need \u2013 we want to modify some files.     Now you need to replace the file:     Go to C: (supposing that C: is your system drive)     Type cd \\Windows\\System32 \u2013 to enter into the folder     Type ren osk.exe osk.old \u2013 be smart, you need to preserve the original file and put it back at the end of the process! If you don\u2019t replace it again it means that you leave open a surface attack!!!     Replace the file with a copy C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe osk.exe     Reboot the server in normal mode.     From the logon screen choose Onscreen keyboard (as in picture).     PowerShell window will be opened \u2013 and you are a local system user!!! You can do a lot of things.     Change the password with command Net user Administrator Password \u2013 where Administrator is the username of local or domain administrator and Password is the password that you want to set.     Login to server with the new password \u2013 just to test that it is working.     Reboot the server and redo all the steps from 1 to 5, but in the way to put back all things in the original state. You need to replace original onscreen keyboard:     Type cd \\Windows\\System32     Type del osk.exe     Replace a file with ren osk.old osk.exe     That\u2019s all. I recommend you to disconnect the server from the internet in the time you are doing these steps. In the same way you can access to the PowerShell window, it can be accessed by anyone who can see logon screen!     As system administrator I always prefer to be the first one who upgrades to new versions (if there are some bugs, I know them in advance). Of course, also in this update, there are some bugs\u2026 In my upgrade, I found these problems:     Unable to edit Local Computer Policy: \u2013 this is not difficult to solve and will take just a second and a computer restart:     Open Windows Explorer and go to the folder C:\\Windows\\System32\\GroupPolicy (it is hiden; you have to type it)     There you will find a folder Machine. Rename it to something else (Machine.old for example)     Try to open Local Computer Policy again     Restart the computer just to be sure that all policies are applied.     Microsoft Edge is not able to connect to almost any page (Cannot securely connect to this page). Here it can be more complicated and you should try more things. Let\u2019s start in the right order:     Review if TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 are enabled:     Open Control Panel and then Internet Options     Go to the tab Advanced Settings     In Setting window search for Security and check if TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 are enabled. I believe that everything is OK, because it worked before the upgrade; but just in case\u2026     Antivirus. Can be a course of the issue. Try to disable or better uninstall antivirus services (disabling is not always enough). Look also on the knowledge base of antivirus company. It was my case. If you have Sophos, here is an article about this issue.     Check the network drivers and update them to the latest version (yes, in some cases this can be a source for the issue; Edge depends on this drivers)     Disable, than reenable IPv6 and after this execute also ipconfig \/renew.     Change the setting in Local Computer Policy.     Start mmc.exe as Administrator and add snap-in Group Policy Object Editor     Select Local Computer     Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > App Package Deployment     Change the Allow deployment operations in special profiles to Enable.     Reinstall Microsoft Edge:     Open PowerShell as Administrator     Run the following cmdlet: Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register \u2018$($_.InstallLocation)\\AppXManifest.xml\u2019     You may receive some errors during the installation, but don\u2019t care about them.     If nothing of this will works, Microsoft recommends reinstalling Windows.     Hope that I helped someone on time. Tomorrow will be a patching date.     In some cases, you need to establish VPN before you login to Windows. As some VPN clients offer this method (not all of them, of course), I had a requirement to create this option with Windows build in client. Here I found a trick; If you want to create VPN connection thru Windows settings, it will not appear on logon screen and this is not useful for me. If you create VPN thru network and sharing centre it is different \u2013 VPN connection appears on logon screen. Makes sense? No, but if you need it, is good to know how to configure it. So, here you can follow the step by step instructions:     Open Control Panel     In Control Panel click View Network status and Tasks     In Network and Sharing Centre you will find a wizard to create a new VPN connection by clicking on Set up a new connection or network. It is almost the same as in other ways, but if you create VPN here, it will appear on the start screen. It is important, that you create VPN for all users!     On the Set up a Connection or Network wizard you have to choose Connect to workplace     On the next step you can use an existing VPN connection or create a new one. If you already have a VPN configured, you can just modify it. In my case I will create a new one (I prefer always to create a new connection). If I have an old configuration, I always delete it and recreate a connection from the scratch     On How do you want to connect, choose Use my Internet connection (VPN)     Write the name or IP of the VPN endpoint, destination name and do not forget to check Allow other people to use this connection. Then click on Create     If you want to do additional setting on this connection (specify protocol, add certificate \u2026), you have to open the ncpa.cpl (Network Control panel) and from there you can review or change all settings you want     A connection done in this way will appear on logon screen and it is possible to establish VPN before you login in Windows.     Lately I had a lot of problems with TLS 1.0 standards, which have changed. For a lot of secure applications you have to disable TLS 1.0, if you want the connection to work. Well, set settings for any user it makes no sense and the only acceptable way it is thru GPO settings. There is no real setting for change-enabled protocol (you have to do it in Internet Explorer settings). The only way I found was changing the registry value of SecuredProtocol, located in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings. But here is only a numerical value and I had to find how is it calculated. I found some values in an article and from here you can calculate the desired value. The basic numbers are: 0 = Do not use secure protocols 2 = PCT 1.0 8 = SSL 2.0 32 = SSL 3.0 128 = TLS 1.0 512 = TLS 1.1 2048 = TLS 1.2 If you want to enable more protocols, just sum the desired numbers. For example, to enable TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2 and SSL 3.0 is 512 + 2048 + 32 = 2592. This is a decimal value for a registry key SecuredProtocol. Deploy a registry value true GPO and the setting is done.     About me     I am working in IT for more than 10 years, concerning most of my time with small companies.

        "text":" Forefoot strikers exhibit lower running-induced knee loading than rearfoot strikers     Abstract Purpose. Knee pain and Achilles tendinopathies are the most common complaints among runners. The differences in the running mechanics may play an important role in the pathogenesis of lower limb overuse injuries. However, the effect of a runner's foot strike pattern on the ankle and especially on the knee loading is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether runners using a forefoot strike pattern exhibit a different lower limb loading profile than runners who use rearfoot strike pattern. Methods. Nineteen female athletes with a natural forefoot strike pattern and pair-matched females with rearfoot strike pattern (n = 19) underwent 3D running analysis at 4 m\/s. Joint angles and moments, patellofemoral contact forces and stresses, and Achilles tendon forces were analyzed and compared between groups. Results. Forefoot strikers demonstrated 1ower patellofemoral contact force and stress compared to heel strikers (4.3 +\/- 1.2 vs. 5.1 +\/- 1.1 body weight, BW; P = 0.029 and 11.1 +\/- 2.9 vs. 13.0 +\/- 2.8 Mpa; P = 0.04). In addition, knee frontal plane moment was lower in the forefoot strikers compared heel strikers (1.49 +\/- 0.51 vs. 1.97 +\/- 0.66 Nm\/kg; P = 0.015). At the ankle level, forefoot strikers showed higher plantarflexor moment (3.12 +\/- 0.40 vs. 2.54 +\/- 0.37 Nm\/kg; P = 0.001) and Achilles tendon force (6.3 +\/- 0.8 vs. 5.1 +\/- 1.3 BW; P = 0.002) compared to rearfoot strikers. Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show differences in patellofemoral loading and knee frontal plane moment between forefoot and rearfoot strikers. Forefoot strikers exhibit both lower patellofemoral stress and knee frontal plane moment than rearfoot strikers which may reduce the risk of running-related knee injuries. On the other hand, parallel increase in ankle plantarflexor and Achilles tendon loading may increase risk for ankle and foot injuries.     The human metabolic response to chronic ketosis without caloric restriction: preservation of submaximal exercise capability with reduced carbohydrate oxidation.     Abstract To study the effect of chronic ketosis on exercise performance in endurance-trained humans, five well-trained cyclists were fed a eucaloric balanced diet (EBD) for one week providing 35-50 kcal\/kg\/d, 1.75 g protein\/kg\/d and the remainder of kilocalories as two-thirds carbohydrate (CHO) and one-third fat. This was followed by four weeks of a eucaloric ketogenic diet (EKD), isocaloric and isonitrogenous with the EBD but providing less than 20 g CHO daily. Both diets were appropriately supplemented to meet the recommended daily allowances for vitamins and minerals. Pedal ergometer testing of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was unchanged between the control week (EBD-1) and week 3 of the ketogenic diet (EKD-3). The mean ergometer endurance time for continuous exercise to exhaustion (ENDUR) at 62%-64% of VO2max was 147 minutes at EBD-1 and 151 minutes at EKD-4. The ENDUR steady-state RQ dropped from 0.83 to 0.72 (P less than 0.01) from EBD-1 to EKD-4. In agreement with this were a three-fold drop in glucose oxidation (from 15.1 to 5.1 mg\/kg\/min, P less than 0.05) and a four-fold reduction in muscle glycogen use (0.61 to 0.13 mmol\/kg\/min, P less than 0.01). Neither clinical nor biochemical evidence of hypoglycemia was observed during ENDUR at EKD-4. These results indicate that aerobic endurance exercise by well-trained cyclists was not compromised by four weeks of ketosis. This was accomplished by a dramatic physiologic adaptation that conserved limited carbohydrate stores (both glucose and muscle glycogen) and made fat the predominant muscle substrate at this submaximal power level.     First Human Tests of New Biosensor That Warns When Athletes Are About to 'Hit the Wall'     July 24, 2013 \u2014 A new biosensor, applied to the human skin like a temporary tattoo, can alert marathoners, competitive bikers and other \"extreme\" athletes that they're about to \"bonk,\" or \"hit the wall,\" scientists are reporting. The study, in ACS' journal Analytical Chemistry, describes the first human tests of the sensor, which also could help soldiers and others who engage in intense exercise -- and their trainers -- monitor stamina and fitness.     Joseph Wang and colleagues explain that the sensor monitors lactate, a form of lactic acid released in sweat. Lactate forms when the muscles need more energy than the body can supply from the \"aerobic\" respiration that suffices during mild exercise. The body shifts to \"anaerobic\" metabolism, producing lactic acid and lactate. That helps for a while, but lactate builds up in the body, causing extreme fatigue and the infamous \"bonking out,\" where an athlete just cannot continue. Current methods of measuring lactate are cumbersome, require blood samples or do not give instant results. Wang's team sought to develop a better approach.     They describe the first human tests of a lactate sensor applied to the skin like a temporary tattoo that stays on and flexes with body movements. Tests on 10 human volunteers showed that the sensor accurately measured lactate levels in sweat during exercise. \"Such skin-worn metabolite biosensors could lead to useful insights into physical performance and overall physiological status, hence offering considerable promise for diverse sport, military, and biomedical applications,\" say the scientists. Future research will further correlate sweat lactate levels with fitness, performance and blood lactate levels, Wang added.

Sixteen endurance-trained cyclists were assigned randomly to a control (CON) group, who consumed their habitual diet (30% \u00b1 8% mJ fat), or a HFD group, who consumed a high-fat isocaloric diet (69% \u00b1 1% mJ fat). At 5-day intervals, the subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); on the next day, they performed a 2.5-hour constant-load ride at 70% peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), followed by a simulated 40-km cycling time-trial while ingesting a 10% 14C-glucose + 3.44% medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) emulsion at a rate of 600 mL\/h. In the OGTT, plasma glucose concentrations at 30 minutes increased significantly after 5 days of the HFD and remained elevated at days 10 and 15 versus the levels measured prior to the HFD (P < .05). The activity of carnitine acyltransferase (CAT) in biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle also increased from 0.45 to 0.54 \u03bcmol\/g\/min over days 0 to 10 of the HFD (P < .01) without any change in citrate synthase (CS) or 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (3-HAD) activities. Changes in glucose tolerance and CAT activity were associated with a shift from carbohydrate (CHO) to fat oxidation during exercise (P < .001), which occurred within 5 to 10 days of the HFD. During the constant-load ride, the calculated oxidation of muscle glycogen was reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 g\/min (P < .001) after 15 days of the HFD. Ingestion of a HFD for as little as 5 to 10 days significantly altered substrate utilization during submaximal exercise but did not attenuate the 40-km time-trial performance.     Changes in the Energy Cost of Running during a 24-h Treadmill Exercise Gimenez, Philippe1; Kerherv\u00e9, Hugo2; Messonnier, Laurent A.3; F\u00e9asson, L\u00e9onard1,4; Millet, Guillaume Y.1     Collapse BoxAbstract Purpose: Although fatigue generally increases the energy cost of running (Cr), the changes of Cr and associated variables during an ultramarathon are not known. This study aimed to determine the changes of metabolic and cardiovascular adjustments during an ultraendurance exercise.     Methods: Twelve healthy males ran 24 h on a motorized treadmill (24TR). Overall oxygen consumption (V\u02d9O2 mL\u00b7min\u22121\u00b7kg\u22121), net energy cost (Cr J\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7m\u22121), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were determined before, every 2 h, and after the 24TR at 8 km\u00b7h\u22121. Running speed and heart rate (HR) were continuously measured during the 24TR.     Results: V\u02d9O2 increased (+7.6%, P < 0.001) during the 24TR, principally in the first 8 h of exercise. The RER mirrored changes in V\u02d9O2, that is, decreased significantly until the eighth hour and remained constant thereafter. As a consequence of RER decrease, the increased Cr was markedly attenuated but was still significantly higher at the 8th and 12th hour compared with pre-24TR. Speed was constant over the first 6 h then significantly decreased during the 24TR. HR increased until the sixth hour (i.e., HR drift), then decreased until post-24TR. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation (R = 0.75, P < 0.01) was observed between the velocity sustained during the 24TR (expressed in percentage of the velocity attained at V\u02d9O2max: %VV\u02d9O2max) and the pre- to postchanges in Cr.     Conclusions: The present study characterized accurately the changes of energy cost and substrate use during an extreme run, showing a plateau after 8 h of exercise. It is also concluded that the participants who maintained the highest %VV\u02d9O2max were also those having most deteriorated their Cr over the 24TR, supporting the notion of a trade-off between running speed (relative to VV\u02d9O2max) and Cr.

        "text":" HIDSENZ \u2013 Pressure sensor for controlling the injection moulding process     The main objective of the project is to develop a new product \u2013 a pressure sensor for controlling the injection moulding process.     We are developing a pressure sensor for controlling the injection moulding process, with the following characteristics:     diagnostics, prognostics and self-maintenance of smart machines and processes;     design of new components that will contribute to stronger integration of the physical and digital world in factories of the future;     development of modern tools and components for systems and processes monitoring and control.     Project description:     In response to the globalisation of business and manufacturing processes and the increasing demands for quality and security, the worldwide need for intelligent management systems in automated processes is growing. The need to monitor production processes in real time is growing, especially in the automotive industry, where the built-in safety components are crucial. Injection of plastic materials is often a blind process, since the user relies on the process parameters of the injection moulding machine itself, but at the same time does not have a direct insight into what is happening in the mould. For the needs of the automotive industry, Hidria AET has developed a pressure sensor called the Hidria Optymus Pressure Sensing System, which is integrated into the Pressure Sensor Glow Plug (PSG) for the requirements of EURO 6 and EURO 7. Hidria has been awarded the CLEPA Association of European Automobile Suppliers for this innovation. Knowledge and technological processes of the development of PSG plugs with pressure sensor will be used to develop a pressure sensor that can be used in industrial processes, for example, injection moulding of polymer materials, aluminium and magnesium die casting, LSR processing, powder spraying, etc.     The key objective of the pressure sensor development is to increase the efficiency of the use of resources in order to reduce electricity and water consumption during processing, reduce the consumption of raw materials and increase the use of recycled materials with the goal of sustainable development.     Hidria and TECOS, in accordance with the objectives of the fifth priority of Slovenia's development strategy, will have to influence the reduction of energy and material intensity. For both partners, the HIDSENZ project means the adoption of new specific expertise in key areas, for example, in the field of monitor, control and optimisation of the injection process with the help of a developed pressure sensor and the development of modern complex injection moulds that will have integrated and affordable pressure sensors.     The role of TECOS:     The role of TECOS is predominantly to extensively test, validate and improve the functionality of the developed prototype pressure sensor as well as performing comparative tests with existing pressure sensors on a specially developed prototype injection mould.     The investment is co - financed by the Republic of Slovenia and the European Union from the European Regional Development Fund.

Mit einem pr\u00e4zisen 3D-Scannen des Originals und mit der Fertigung des funktionalen CAD-Modells wurden genaue Daten zur Fertigung des Ersatzrotors und der Messer gewonnen.     Der Kunde sah bei der Werkzeugentwicklung etwaige \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfige Biegung des Spritzgussprodukts bei der Abk\u00fchlung (Werkstoff PA66 mit 30% der Glasfaser) vorher. Mit der Spritzgusssimulation wurden die Deformationen vorhergesehen und das Problem wurde erfolgreich gel\u00f6st.     F\u00fcr das dargestellte Beispiel sah der Auftraggeber nur eine Phase vorher, aber es gab Zweifel in Bezug auf die Fehler beim Tiefziehen. Mit der Analyse wurden die Zweifel entkr\u00e4ftet.     Wir f\u00fchrten eine Vergleichsstudie zwischen der experimentell gemessenen Tragf\u00e4higkeit des behandelten Produkts und der Vorhersage der FEM-Festigkeitsberechnung unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung der tats\u00e4chlichen Faserorientierung aus.

And it was indeed. This topic led us to discover insides of Komiza and Komizan people aka: komizians. It is known that important jobs in this city are run by female directors. The mayor of the city is female as are the director of nautic center, director of school, director of elderly home, director of kindergarten, director of \u201ckomunala\u201d system and a few more.     Brief (link-rich) info page on the MA in Media Arts and Practices Programme of the University of Nova Gorica School of Arts.     The second day of Visioneca was paced somewhat differently than the strict 50-film staccato of the day before, with host-of-the-day Bob Cotton's very own fluxus manner. Still I wonder, how do the English manage to get things done quite precisely on time, but looking as if punctuality or schedules were the last thing they cared about. So again, I shall mention only the most memorable: Kavi, a sunrising graduate student from Bournemouth, presented her BA project \"cerebral interface\" and even though it didn't work live on Paul's head, it left a convincing impression (and optimism) of the things to come -- visualizing states of mind, the wild dream of many a media artist of the last century.     Getting digitally dressed up for the \"Designs on eLearning\" 2012 conference at the University of The Arts London (Sep 5-7, 2012) under the motto of \"Crowd and cloud: towards a collaborative future\":     Just like last year the School of Arts participated in the Komi\u017ea New Media Port (Video Vortex Summer School) international gathering in Komi\u017ea on the island of Vis, Croatia, July 7-15, 2012. Lead by renowned artists Dan Oki and Dalibor Martinis the summer school joined 24 students and mentors from 6 art schools (Zagreb, Brighton, Reka, Gent, Split, Nova Gorica) in an 8-day multi-process of workshops, research-based productions, conceptual experimentation, and good fun.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

        "text":" Vietnam \u2013 Beijing Layover     So, we\u2019ve come to Beijing, now what? There\u2019s quite a few options, because you can get a free Visa, you just need to stand in line for about an hour, and off you go-your only limitation is how much time you got on your hands\u2026     We decided to go to Tiananmen Square, to see The Forbidden city and then to The Temple of Heaven. I\u2019m a bit of \u201cHistory addict\u201d, especially if something\u2019s Ancient by origin\u2026 So, we went to the famous square, through The Forbidden city, took a few pictures and clips, but didn\u2019t stay there for too long, because it was freezing cold and we were all tired from the trip so far. So, we went through the old part of the city, found a Starbucks, and stopped there for a while to regain, well\u2026.coffeine ;). After that, we went on their Subway again and headed to The Temple of Heaven. And I looooooved it. It\u2019s a great complex, built somewhere between 1406-1420 during the reign of Yongle Emperor, who was according to Wikipedia, also responsible for building the Forbidden city (didn\u2019t know that). Later on, it was renovated in 18th century. But, because it was still cold, around 0 degrees C, we got out of there, and headed back to the Airport.     I liked their subway system, it can be a little confusing at times, but it\u2019s all colour-coded and numbered, and with the map that you can get anywhere, it\u2019s quite hard to get lost.     We had a 2AM flight to Hanoi, Vietnam next day, so\u2026we were all excited to finally getting there. "

Kako si ocenil ta artikel? *     The new ultra bright and indestructible night and hunting binoculars Pirschler 15x56 Abbe-K\u00f6nig \/ Magnesium     are the long-awaited new star of our Pirschler with 15x magnification. Besides excellent optical qualities these binoculars are specially designed for longevity. Additionally, the most modern materials and construction technologies from airplane manufacturing have made these 15x56 binoculars much lighter than their predecessor.     Stability and sturdiness of the binoculars     There are absolutely no plastic parts to be found on the new Pirschler binoculars (except for the tripod protection cap). Not on the body, not on the expendable parts. Body and bridge are made of an ultra hard but extremely light magnesium alloy from airplane construction and make the binoculars almost unbreakable. Additional advantage: The magnesium lowers the total weight to 1200g. The diopter (adjustment range +-4) isn't situated on the focusing wheel anymore, but on the right ocular, because of better functionality. All these features - diopter, ocular, focusing wheel - are made of duraluminium and are thus a guaranty for excellent long time use. A so called best-grip armoring on the outside of the casing prevents a slipping of the hands. Thus, the one-handed gripping and holding of these compact binoculars, even with gloves, are coveniently comfortable and safe.     Brilliant binoculars optics in a completely separately manufactured body     There are two possibilities to enlargen binoculars series. One the one hand the manufacturer can take the body of the already existing binoculars and exchange optical elements. On the other hand the manufacturer can put effort in it and completely change the optics in order to reach an optimum for binoculars with 15x magnification. We chose the extensive way for the Pirschler and designed an entirely new body which is 4cm longer than the body of the Pirschler 8x56. This is the only way to reach an optimal result for binoculars with 15x magnification.     Specialist during the night     Even if the optics delights during the day, the Pirschler has been made or the hunt during the night. With progressing twilight the Pirschler starts to show its qualities, even if other products already lose their image brightness and brilliancy. One could almost get the impression that the resolution and contrast are even better during progressing twilight. Even the Pirschler with 15x magnification doesn't disappoint in late night. That way one can reliably target even in progressed darkness.     Great partner in Africa     The 15x56 could already convince in the large expanses in Namibia. While the size of the model attracted resentments at first, the Pirschler 15x56 soon won over the hearts of the users. The advantage to target on distances on up to 900m more than balanced the small disadvantage of the size. And a weight of 1200g is still tolerable. Anyway, the 10x binoculars soon stayed in the hotel rooms and everybody wanted to use the 15x design.     Water pressure tight casing and water-repellent nano coating     The \"raindefender nano\" coating ensures a water-repellent lotus effect, the binoculars are completely water pressure tight until 1m in warm and cold water.     Smart Focus 50m-infinity     The Smart Focus is an advantage during twilight and night: this technology almost entirely excludes the refocussing for the Pirschler 15x56. After an acuity adjustment on an object in a distance of 100m the eye can automatically adjust in a range of 50m up to infinity without having to constantly refocus.     Adjustment of the 50m-infinity feature     To adjust the feature the palpable marking on the focusing wheel needs to be turned to \"up\".     Wide field of view     The field of view of 80m offers clear advantages during observation and makes recognition and targeting of game a lot faster.     Also suitable for spectacle wearers     The metal eye cups are adjustable in three positions and thus ensure a perfect eye distance. The adjustment is hard-going, solid and works without play. The eye cup mechanics are of a clearly ameliorated quality compared to the predecessor model and can be felt through an appropriate haptic resistance and the clearly defined lock of the positions. (No clicking, no play, no unintentional adjustment). The Pirschler 15x56 also features a larger distance of the exit pupil (20mm) compared to other binoculars of its category.

        "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Independent taskforce of legal experts: Proposed legal solutions for unresolved issues following the bank recovery and resolution of 2013     05\/05\/2021 \/ Press release     Banka Slovenije has taken a more active role in seeking solutions to unresolved issues in connection with the recovery and resolution of the banking system in 2013, and the impact on those involved in that process from the decisions made at that time by the competent institutions. Given the unsuccessful attempts to find solutions to unresolved issues, judicial relief has still not been guaranteed for all participants in that process. The independent taskforce of legal experts set up at Banka Slovenije to draw up proposed solutions for unresolved issues has completed its work, and today presented a report of its key findings.     The taskforce consists of Prof Miha Juhart, Dr Miro Prek, Prof Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00fcm and Franc Testen. Their findings, which they presented to leaders of parliamentary groups earlier today, are cited below.     Banka Slovenije will study their findings, and will brief the competent institutions accordingly.     Taskforce\u2019s conclusions and proposed solutions     Objective liability on the part of Banka Slovenije is not the key to a solution of the issue of (potential) claims against commercial banks by former holders of qualified liabilities.     Changing the definition (qualification) of Banka Slovenije\u2019s liability for damages (from qualified culpability to objective liability and back again) is not a suitable solution that could satisfactorily resolve the issues of bank recovery and resolution.     a) Article 350a of the ZBan-1 is not a suitable basis for assessing the former holders\u2019 entitlement to the reimbursement of the loss suffered in the write-down. It is thus possible to clarify why the Constitutional Court interpreted the ZBan-1 such that it sets out objective liability for any losses incurred. Objective liability was then also enforced by the ZPSVIKOB. The described intervention by the Constitutional Court and the adoption of the ZPSVIKOB in essence mean that barely anything remains of the original content of Article 350a in connection with Article 223a of the ZBan-1. To put it more precisely: only the provision that Banka Slovenije is passively legitimate and liable for payment (even under modified conditions).     The provisions of the Banking Act (Article 350a of the ZBan-1) did not provide a suitable basis for resolving the claims of former holders of qualified liabilities. The Constitutional Court built upon them with its requirements for effective judicial relief, which were pursued by the legislator in the adoption of the ZPSVIKOB. Banka Slovenije's liability was modified from culpability to objective liability, where the tendency is for Banka Slovenije\u2019s liability to again be judged according to the criteria of culpability (following the decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union). For now, it is clear only that under all arrangements to date Banka Slovenije has been designated as responsible for paying compensation to the former holders, and will also be the defendant in judicial proceedings; it is extremely questionable whether Banka Slovenije can be ordered to pay compensation.     The introduction of a reimbursement scheme funded from the budget would be a consistent solution.     b) The enforcement of objective liability is in accordance with the concepts on which Directive 2014\/59\/EU is based (although adopted subsequently), although these arrangements would require the compensation for the aforementioned curtailment to not be borne by Banka Slovenije. This means that in regulations governing judicial relief for former holders on the basis of Article 350a, the state should be designated the passively legitimate party (at least until the establishment of any scheme for financing resolution). Otherwise it would be a case of impermissible monetary financing: Banka Slovenije would have to settle the state\u2019s liabilities.     For similar cases, the applicable arrangements in the EU (the BRRD) envisage resolution via funding from special resolution funds, which are built up through contributions by banks. Bank resolution would first be the responsibility of the state, and then the responsibility of the banking community, but never the responsibility of the central bank. The central bank\u2019s obligation to provide funding for bank resolution breaches the prohibition of monetary financing, and at the same time encroaches on the independence of the central bank.     c) With regard to the existing legal arrangements (passive legitimacy of Banka Slovenije), a solution is offered by legislating for a claim of recourse by Banka Slovenije against the state on the basis of exculpation through proof of the absence of culpability. Or a solution that is even more in keeping with the nature of the legal relationship: a government scheme for financing resolution (potentially with a claim of recourse, under the principle of culpability on the part of Banka Slovenije).     Should Banka Slovenije be required to pay compensation, it could demand reimbursement from the state if it proves that it was not culpable. A more direct solution would be the establishment of a reimbursement scheme.     d) According to the described arrangements for Banka Slovenije\u2019s objective liability, the possibility that former holders only formulate declaratory claims on the merits, and the general arrangements under the ZPP, the courts will be able to order the submission of all necessary documents and the disclosure of all necessary information, which Banka Slovenije will be required to submit and to disclose. The submitted documents and disclosed information will be properly protected, and provisions on virtual data rooms are not essential for the exercise of the former holders\u2019 rights.     The arrangements already in force allow the former holders\u2019 claims to be pursued even without special additional arrangements with regard to access to documents and disclosure of information. Banka Slovenije has already granted access to all information required by the attorney of a former holder to lodge a lawsuit.     The reimbursement scheme seems to be the only solution that is sufficiently acceptable in legal terms, transparent, consistent and effective.     e) The establishment of a reimbursement scheme to reimburse the curtailment, having regard for the precepts formulated in legislation in certain similar cases of curtailment, where it was not feasible or reasonable to substantiate a system of liability for damages, seems to be a suitable option for resolving issues in the pursuit of claims by former holders.     All finally awarded amounts of all former holders and all amounts to which former holders are found to be entitled by competent authorities in prescribed proceedings (this refers to arbitration, settlement and other forms of dispute resolution that might occur: this is contingent on the appropriate amendment of the legislation) would be settled from the reimbursement scheme.     f) Restricting the burdens of the implementation of the ZPSVIKOB to the functioning of Banka Slovenije can be achieved by spinning off the resolution of disputes to a specialist department or by transferring these tasks by law to another (or new) public sector entity, which can be a solution that helps Banka Slovenije to participate more effectively in judicial disputes of this type.     g) Process mechanisms: Stipulation of the exclusive territorial and material jurisdiction of a single court, mandatory consolidation of actions, encouragement of actions lodged via a joint representative, indispensable co-litigation, special provisions on lists of parties, etc. do not satisfactorily resolve the legal and practical problems faced by the court and in particular by the defendant as a result of the sheer number of plaintiffs expected. This problem (in the phase of proceedings after declaratory claims) can be partly alleviated by the amendment of the provision on co-litigation, such that genuine indispensable co-litigation is legislated for former holders of the same class at a particular commercial bank. The taskforce also assessed the feasibility and suitability of other solutions to this problem: representative test proceedings, the collective action, and the transfer of process legitimacy.     None of the solutions under the ZPSVIKOB that the legislator believed could meet the objective set by the Constitutional Court (effective judicial relief) is of itself capable of meeting the objective: a large number of lengthy, complex judicial proceedings would be necessary. Representative test proceedings have previously been legislated, as have proceedings with collective actions; some of the potential solutions (e.g. the transfer of process legitimacy, which entails the mandatory representation of all former holders in a specific class by a single statutory representative) are extremely constitutionally questionable. Significant gains might only come in the second part of the proceedings, when and if they happen (the courts could find in the first part of the proceedings that the former holders\u2019 claims are substantiated, and would determine the amount of compensation in the second part).     h) Representative test proceedings: There is an argument that the existing ZPSVIKOB allows for representative test proceedings to be conducted, under the mutatis mutandis application of the ZPP. If the provision on mandatory consolidation of actions is shown to prevent this, it would only require a minor revision to the ZPSVIKOB. However, representative test proceedings would significantly reduce the burden on the court solely in the event of them ending with a finding fully in favour of the claim. Otherwise the proceedings that would continue in suspended cases would face the same problems caused by the sheer number of disputes.     i) Collective action: Compensatory redress for qualified creditors could be pursued as a collective action, but it is highly uncertain what reduction in the number of proceedings would actually be brought by this solution. A solution of this type would in any case require an amendment of the law (the ZKolT, or even better, the ZPSVIKOB), which is not constitutionally questionable, as the collective action does not replace individual judicial relief, but merely augments the possibilities, provided that the opt-in principle is applied. Here the main issue seems to be the creation of a representative organisation for creditors. This approach to lodging compensatory redress might be appealing to creditors, if mechanisms for positively motivating creditors to join such an approach to pursuing redress were to be set out.     j) Transfer of process legitimacy: This is an almost perfect solution, but not only is it demanding in legislative terms, it is also constitutionally extremely questionable. It is a matter of the exclusive transfer of the right of access to a tribunal, which denies plaintiffs their right to judicial relief, and would find it hard to withstand a constitutional assessment under the strictest test of proportionality. The essential attributes of the transfer of process legitimacy and the necessary constitutional caveats addressed by the European Court of Human Rights in the Lithgow case are perhaps of interest, as they touch on certain issues that might be relevant in any decision to apply the institution of collective action under the opt-in principle to the disputed case of the former holders.     k) The taskforce draws attention to the possibility of reducing the problem of the sheer number of disputes in the scheduling phase. The solution of having the matter decided on by administrative units in administrative proceedings is worthy of consideration. This would ensure decentralisation and sharing of the burden of the large number of claims. The bases for scheduling are simple and standardised, while standardisation of the practices of administrative units could be ensured by the use of software to calculate compensation schedules.     About the reimbursement scheme:     All cases of already-functioning reimbursement schemes (trial without undue delay, the erased in part, the wrongfully convicted) involve objective liability for certain consequences of acts issued by the authorities. In all cases it is also stipulated by law that compensation payments should be borne by the state from the state budget, either from a special fund on behalf of and for the account of the state, or from an item in the financial plan of the designated authority.     The ZPSVIKOB also defines Banka Slovenije\u2019s objective liability for the curtailment suffered by the former holders. As soon as unlawfulness is established in the narrower sense, i.e. irrespective of culpability, Banka Slovenije must reimburse the former holders for the actual curtailment of their assets, namely the value that would have remained had the extraordinary measure not been imposed (i.e. if the bank had not received state aid and would potentially not have fallen into bankruptcy, or, in the event of bankruptcy, the former holders would have been repaid (at least in part)).     The reimbursement scheme is a solution that the taskforce believes would provide an effective answer to the prohibition of monetary financing. In previous discussions this option was not elaborated in detail.     One of the potential solutions would be for the funding for the reimbursement scheme to be provided by the BAMC, the state and Banka Slovenije in accordance with the rules that were just about to be aligned in various processes.     There are several different options with regard to the approach to the creation and operation of the reimbursement scheme:     1. first proposed solution: restriction of the burdens of the implementation of the ZPSVIKOB to the functioning of Banka Slovenije:     a) Spin-off within the framework of Banka Slovenije (ensuring the organisational and functional independence of a department to deal exclusively with issues in connection with the former holders\u2019 proceedings).     b) Tasks in connection with bank recovery and resolution now performed by Banka Slovenije are transferred by law to any of the already functioning institutions. Issues with regard to this transfer are regulated by law.     c) A new public sector entity is established by law with the exclusive task of making repayments for which it is determined in judicial proceedings and amicable resolution proceedings that such repayments should be made, to whom and in what amount.     2. second proposed solution: create a system for the amicable resolution of claims, and submit it to stakeholders for discussion and confirmation in principle (having regard for the two major groups of creditors, namely large investors and retail investors, and the two categories of claimants, namely holders of bonds and similar rights, and shareholders), then adopt it in the form of a law or other legal rules.

        "text":" Abstract: The rule of law is the fundamental basis for the functioning of any constitutional democracy in a free and democratic state. It is a precondition for a person's self-fulfilment and a functioning economy. A strategic constitutional and actual priority for Slovenia is to lay the foundations for the functioning of a real rule of law, which need to be internalised by the people, both in the public and the private sector. The rule of law is a precondition for the functioning of all state systems, as well as its social subsystems, particularly the economy. Slovenia started its path towards the rule of law only after declaring independence in 1991. In adopting a new Constitution -- despite legal continuity from the previous state -- Slovenia accepted explicitly and with high political consensus the values of the rule of law and the protection of human rights, setting them at the top of its normative, constitutional and legal framework.

        "text":" Lecture of 23rd November 2015     Alain Badiou     Keywords: mass murder, contemporary fascism, war, symptom, the return of politics     Abstract     In this lecture, which aims at an elucidation of what happened on the 13th of November in Paris, the speaker designates the perpetrated mass murder as one of many current symptoms of a serious disease of the contemporary world as a whole, while attempting at the same time to outline the possible ways for a healing of this disease, of which the proliferation of similar events in the world is but a particularly violent and particularly spectacular symptom. Starting out from a brief analysis of the world as it is today, characterised by mass crimes and the war declared by the State, the speaker then returns to the actual situation, describing it not as it is, but rather as the situation that we should desire that it becomes, involving the will and action that will make similar symptoms disappear. In conclusion, the speaker considers the possibility of a different thought, one that would evade the traps of the shaping of public opinion and the reactive orientation of the State. Such a thought will focus on the conditions of what the speaker calls a return of politics, more precisely, a return of emancipatory politics, this being a politics that will reject all inclusion within the framework of the world, as was described at the beginning.

Elements of a CMM system     Get in touch     RESOLUTE\u2122 encoders also offer a wide range of rotary (angle) scale diameters providing greater flexibility in product design.     SOLPOWER (Taiwan)     VIONiC\u2122 encoder series     The VIONiC encoder series is Renishaw's highest performing incremental optical encoder. VIONiC encoders provide direct digital position feedback with superior metrology, high reliability, intuitive auto-calibration and a super-compact form factor.     Encoder scales for CMMs     Substrate mastered scales offer a range of benefits for precision CMMs with low CTE \/ high thermal mass substrates. An alternative encoder scale solution is Renishaw's floating RTL stainless steel tape scales, which can be mounted with the FASTRACK\u2122 scale carrier system, providing easy installation with no fixing holes required and also allowing scale to be quickly replaced, even where access is limited, thus reducing machine downtime.     XM-600 multi-axis calibrator     The XM-600 multi-axis calibrator has been designed with additional functionality allowing it to communicate directly with Renishaw's UCC controllers. Using technology developed for the XM-60 multi-axis calibrator, XM-600 simultaneously measures all six degrees of freedom within a single measurement. This provides the ability to easily create an accurate error map for each linear axis of your CMM.     XM-600 maintains the same compatibility with CARTO as XM-60, making it the ideal calibration solution for any manufacturing facility that utilises both machine tools and CMMs.     RESOLUTE\u2122 True Absolute Encoder System     For CMM applications that require an absolute encoder system, the RESOLUTE encoder series offers superior absolute position feedback at fine resolutions and with ultra low Sub-Divisional Error and jitter.     Powerful metrology software     MODUS metrology software provides a powerful platform for 5-axis measurement. A configurable user interface allows programs to be developed offline, drawing geometry, embedded dimensions and tolerance data from CAD, with full simulation and collision detection. The software includes certified algorithms for feature measurement, feature construction and part alignment.     Programs can be created offline directly from CAD with on-screen probe path verification. The CMM environment, the fixture and the location of the part on the machine can all be defined, enabling full simulation and crash detection of 5\u2011axis measurement programs. This minimises CMM down-time as programs arrive at the machine ready to run, with little or no prove-out time required.     Controllers     Renishaw's range of UCC universal CMM controllers provide precise control of the motion of the machine, interfacing to all Renishaw CMM sensors, and communications with the metrology software. Renishaw's UCC flexible controllers provide advanced touch-trigger and scanning algorithms, which allow fast, accurate, adaptive part measurement. "

        "text":" Center for Contemporary Arts     V-F-X Ljubljana Programme     Luka Prin\u010di\u010d: trans.fail     Duration: 45\u2032 Free tickets     This hybrid AV solo performance utilises pre-recorded and real-time live audio-visual elements and texts to create a frantic and chaotic mesh of data, images and noise. It sources data from various media channels and transfigures them: online videos, home-made software, sonic explorations and visual algorithms, hacks, glitchings and a number of thematic focuses, such as the Slavic-Romani mythical futurism, gender fluidity, imperialism, media theories, praxis and the artistic critique of digital capitalism. The performance premiered online; this is the first time that it will be performed before a live audience.     Luka Prin\u010di\u010d is a musician, performer and intermedia artist, who has worked in the field of computer and electronic music, sound art, intermedia installations and performance art for years, focusing on diverse approaches to creative processes and their manifestation in artistic events and works.     Production: Emanat     Wednesdy, 7 July, 21.00     sixpackfilm Presents: Body Games     Art & Revolution was the name of the action that ended up becoming one of the most famous happenings of the Austrian post-war period. G\u00fcnter Brus, Otto M\u00fchl and Peter Weibel were summoned to court. Otmar Bauer was also present that day. His famous action known as Vomit-Action remains one of the most radical works of Viennese Actionism. Birth of Venus by Moucle Blackout is more relaxed, but no less offensive. Stiffness 1-3\/7 is a long-term serial conceptual project about masturbation. Mara Mattuschka is one of the most outstanding representatives of Austrian avant-garde filmmaking. Her films are well-known for their extreme high- and low-angle shots and shifts in perspective with which she modulates the appearance of the filmed bodies and faces. In Couples, Maria Lassnig combines animation techniques and real image to depict bodies that do not always wish to fit into one another. Cmelka, in turn, rubs cream on her body, affected by neurodermatitis, in a film in which the artist\u2019s very skin fuses with the skin of the film strip. In Prince of Peace, against the backdrop of tolling church bells and a staccato editing, Hans Scheugl\u2019s camera follows several men as they enter a public toilet that, at the time, was a well-known gay cruising place. For Ashley Hans Scheirl, super 8 has been one of their favourite artistic tools since the very beginning of their filmmaking career; the films they made in collaboration with Ursula P\u00fcrrer show a strong commitment to the queercore and punk movements. This hedonistic subculture is particularly present in Summer of 1995, which captures the drag king fever that was raging in London at the time.     The programme will be introduced by Jonida La\u00e7i.     Art & Revolution (Kunst & Revolution) Ernst Schmidt jr., Austria, 1968, 16 mm, 1.33, 2\u2032, 2\u2032, silent ______________ Actions by G\u00fcnter Brus, Otto Muehl, Peter Weibel, Franz Kaltenb\u00f6ck, Otmar Bauer, Herbert Stumpfl, Anastas, Oswald Wiener, and an unidentified masochist. Experimental documentary film about one of the most famous happenings by the Viennese Actionists, which includes real footage from the event. Having scandalized the Austrian society and government, the happening led to multiple attacks by the press and ended up with Otto Muehl and G\u00fcnter Brus summoned to court. Oswald Wiener was forced to flee the country.     Otmar Bauer Shows (Otmar Bauer zeigt) Otmar Bauer, Austria, 1969, digital (shot on 16 mm), 7\u2032, silent ______________ One of the most radical works of Viennese Actionism \u2013a performance during which Bauer drinks, vomits, eats, urinates, and wallows in his own effluents, without showing the slightest consideration for himself or the audience.     Birth of Venus (Die Geburt der Venus) Moucle Blackout, Austria, 1970\u20131972, 35 mm, 1.37, 5\u2032 ______________ To three songs by The Beatles and in free association with the eponymous Botticelli figure, Blackout combines symmetric cuts of pigs (using a mirror effect) with portraits of different people and pictures of dancing women.     STIFFNESS 1-3\/7 (STEIFHEIT 1-3\/7) Albert Sackl, Austria, 2018, 35 mm, 1.37, 9\u2032, silent ______________ A serial conceptual long-term project about masturbation. Every ten years, Sackl sits in front of his 16mm camera and tries to keep an erection for around four hours. The resulting footage is then compressed into a 3-minute film through time lapse and single image recording. To this date, 3 of the 7 episodes that Sackl plans to create have been completed. The project, which may, at first glance, look banal and chauvinistic turns out to be a humorous self-deconstruction that incidentally happens to offer an overview of the history of pornography through the lens of its reception by the viewers.     Nabel Fabel Mara Mattuschka, Austria, 1985, 16 mm, 1.33, 4\u2032 ______________ Mara Mattuschka is one of the most outstanding representatives of Austrian avant-garde filmmaking who had already caused a stir with her alter ego Mimi Minus. \u201cIn Navel Fable she subjects herself to a second birth through endless pairs of tights. Her body struggles so hard and in such a deformed manner from out of the layers of nylon that the sheer struggle for survival becomes visible.\u201d \u2013 Peter Tscherkassky     Neurodermitis Kerstin Cmelka, Austria, Germany, 1998, 16 mm, 1.37, 3\u2032, silent ______________ Cmelka rubs cream on her body affected by neurodermatitis in a film in which the artist\u2019s very skin fuses with the skin of the film strip.     Couples Maria Lassnig, Austria, USA, 1972, 16 mm, 1.37, 10\u2032 ______________ Lassnig combines animation techniques and real image to depict bodies that don\u2019t always wish to fit into one another. This footage is paired with short and repetitive but hilarious episodes that portray a failing love affair.     Super-8 Girl Games Ursula P\u00fcrrer, Ashley Hans Scheirl, Austria, 1985, digital (shot on 16 mm), 1.37, 2\u2032 ______________ The film radiates an incredible freshness of intimacy and vitality. The filmmakers characterised the series of films that Super-8 Girl Games belong to as \u201chome movies\u201d.     Prince of Peace Hans Scheugl, Austria, 1993, 16 mm, 1.37, 6\u2032 ______________ With a backdrop of tolling church bells and a staccato editing, Hans Scheugl\u2019s camera follows several men as they enter a public toilet that was, at the time, a well-known cruising place for gay men. The footage is intermingled with inserts of fragmented pictures from a porn magazine in which the portrayed model wears a Jesus tattoo on his upper arm. The film is dedicated to a friend who \u2013 as the year of production suggests \u2013 died of AIDS.     S.O.S Extraterrestria Mara Mattuschka, Germany, Austria, 1993, 16 mm, 1.33, 10\u2032 ______________ The world as a playground for a giantess from outer space. A Godzilla imitation on the way to herself: the giantess from outer space in the streets of a big city, fooling around, producing destruction, copulating with the Eiffel Tower.     Summer of 95 Jason Elvis Parker, Ashley Hans Scheirl, Austria, 1995, 16 mm, 1.33, 13\u2032 ______________ For Ashley Hans Scheirl, whose works with Jakob Lena Knebl have been selected to be featured at the Austrian Pavilion for the Venice Biennale 2021, super 8 has been one of his favorite artistic tools since the very beginning of his filmmaking career. The films he made in collaboration with Ursula P\u00fcrrer in the 80s show a strong commitment with the queercore and punk movements. His work materializes positive sexual energies that denounce the bourgeois judgmental and moralist perspectives while celebrating sexual pluralism.     Thank you, I have been very pleased (Danke, es hat mich sehr gefreut) Mara Mattuschka, Austria, 1987, 16 mm, 1.33, 2\u2032 ______________ A nude Mimi Minus engages in autoerotic activity while the camera distances itself, in leaps and bounds, to the point that Mimi\u00b4s white figure is tiny and eventually disappears in a glaring, high-contrast mountain landscape.     sixpackfilm was founded in 1990 as a non-profit organisation. The task undertaken by sixpackfilm is to secure an audience for Austrian film and video art, both inside Austria and abroad. Their current catalogue encompasses over 1,900 titles, including the historical classics of the Austrian film avant-garde.     Thanks to Austrian Cultural Forum Ljubljana for help in organising the programme.     Thursday, 8 July, 16.00     Round Table: Space and Time to Experiment     Duration: 90\u2019 Free tickets In English     At the round table discussion, we will talk about the circumstances in which experimental film and video works are forged, made and shown. The participants will present their experiences, thoughts and initiatives. The discussion between An\u017ee Per\u0161in (Stenar Projects, Lisbon), Greg de Cuir Jr. (Alternative Film\/Video, Belgrade) and Sa\u0161o Sedla\u010dek (Academy of Fine Arts and Design, Ljubljana) will be moderated by Varja Mo\u010dnik (Slovenian Cinematheque).     Thursday, 8 July, 19.00     Curated Programme Stenar Projects: A Support Structure Through Its Catalogue     An Emotional Sherpa by the Norwegian artist Trygve Luktvasslimo was Stenar Projects\u2019 first production and is the first film in this curated programme, an examination of a support structure and its catalogue. Sunstone by Filipa Cesar and Louis Henderson was the first project that Stenar Projects received film funding for. Contemporary art funding often does not cover the total cost of a moving-image project, so access to the majority of film funds requires festival distribution. That is why, in addition to funding and production, Stenar Projects also took up festival distribution. The third film in the programme is I gave my love a cherry that had no stone by the British artist Emily Wardill. Emily defines her piece as a sculpture. It is usually installed on a big heavily tilted screen and runs as a loop. This is the first time she has apprehensively agreed to show it in a cinema. It is on this point of discomfort and ambition between how we exhibit, how we produce and how we finance that Stenar has been meeting its artists for the last six years.     The programme will be introduced by An\u017ee Per\u0161in.     An Emotional Sherpa Trygve Luktvasslimo, Norway, Portugal, 2015, DCP, 2.35, 22\u2019 ______________ The film tracks Fresnel lenses from their site of production to their exhibition in a museum of lighthouses and navigational devices. It also examines the diverse social contexts in which optics are implicated, contrasting the system of triangular trade that followed the first European arrivals in the \u2018New World\u2019 with the political potential seen in Op art in post-revolutionary Cuba. Incorporating 16mm celluloid images, digital desktop captures and 3D CGI, the film also maps a technological trajectory: from historical methods of optical navigation to new algorithms of locating, from singular projection to multi-perspective satellite visions.     Sunstone Filipa C\u00e9sar, Louis Henderson, Portugal, 2018, DCP (shot on 16 mm), 16:9, 34\u2019 ______________ The film tracks Fresnel lenses from their site of production to their exhibition in a museum of lighthouses and navigational devices. It also examines the diverse social contexts in which optics are implicated, contrasting the system of triangular trade that followed the first European arrivals in the \u2018New World\u2019 with the political potential seen in Op art in post-revolutionary Cuba. Incorporating 16mm celluloid images, digital desktop captures and 3D CGI, the film also maps a technological trajectory: from historical methods of optical navigation to new algorithms of locating, from singular projection to multi-perspective satellite visions.     I gave my love a cherry that had no stone Emily Wardill, Portugal, 2016, DCP, 16:9, 9\u2019 ______________ Holding in her mind Dorothea Tanning\u2019s painting Some Roses and their Phantoms (1952) and its sickening presentation of objects as between states of being, Wardill made a film that also hovers between definitions. The architecture of the Gulbenkian auditorium in Lisbon, its colours and sense of being lost in time accompany us through a loop where a man wanders the building at night, followed by something that is not human. Through the care and paranoia with which she approaches the digital image, the artist investigates the haunting of the present by the past and the remnants of textures longing to be touched.     Stenar Projects is a production platform that focuses on the artists\u2019 moving image and supports novel film practices through development, funding, production and distribution. Ranging between various genres and formats, its projects include an experimental feature documentary, a speculative short film, a digital animation and a micro-film, among others. Working closely with its collaborating artists, Stenar Projects has been producing new works for major art institutions and exhibiting films at international film festivals.     An\u017ee Per\u0161in has 18 years of experience in film. He had worked on commercial film production throughout Southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and owned a commercial production company in Lisbon. Since 2015, he has been developing Stenar Projects, a production platform for the artists\u2019 moving image, based in Portugal. An\u017ee is a member of Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Produtores de Cinema e Audiovisual in Portugal and a 2019 Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program Grantee.     Thursday, 8 July, 21.00     Selection from the DIVA Station Archive: An Escape into Experiment     From a TV signal to video, from film stock to computer generated images. Te selection of works from the DIVA Station archive is a collage of different aesthetic and substantive approaches that reflect the time of their making and the technical limitations of a particular medium. All works share the creation of their own interspace of interpretation within the classically defined bearers of messages (words, images, sound, music\u2026).     The programme will be presented by Peter Cerov\u0161ek and Vesna Bukovec.     Space 2 Miha Vipotnik, Slovenia (Yu), 1986, digital (shot on U-matic), 4:3, 1\u2019 52\u201d \u00bb video ______________ In this video, Vipotnik makes an ironic statement about the state of Slovenian video production at the time and its (non-)inclusion in the TV programme. At first, the artist is sitting in a studio like a TV presenter, but then his statement continues as a voice-over accompanying a montage of segments from his older black-and-white video entitled Space, which were subjected to chroma keying. The video was broadcast as part of Avtovizija (1986), the first programme on auteur video on RTV Ljubljana.     Tereza Zemira Alajbegovi\u0107, Slovenia (Yu), 1983, 4:3, digital (shot on VHS), 4\u2019 24\u201d \u00bb video ______________ A collage of the manifestations of socialist victories and funerals, melodramatic films and family TV shows accompanied by the singing of Tereza Kesovija, the star of Yugoslav pop culture. A society ruled by old men and socialist populism; public and intimate life intertwine, connected in a dull and stuffy rhythm of passing time.     Three Doors Gorazd Krnc, Slovenia, 2007, digital, 4:3, 3\u2019 11\u201d \u00bb video ______________ The video collage is accompanied by the narration and dialogues borrowed from Barbarella (Roger Vadim, 1968). Using a green screen, the scenes cut out from the film are applied to the background composed of collaged shots covered by various filters during the editing. With this process, the film\u2019s galactic content is transferred into the real world and the metaphor of three doors on which Barbarella is based obtains a realer context.     Here and Now Neven Korda, Slovenia, 2007, digital, 4:3, 8\u2019 50\u201d \u00bb video ______________ The visualised and dubbed biography of Neven Korda is composed of a number of films from the New New Films (NNF) series. The film begins with the entire Gagarin and the narrator of 1 Sec of My Life. The sound and picture of Reincarnation on Taxidermist Monitor, Angelic Wreath on Speed and Angelic Wreath on Ocean are mixed. The artist characterised the work as a post (re-)use of finished works in the mode of editing on a timeline.     Computering_preview Sara Bezov\u0161ek, Slovenia, 2019, HD, 2\u2019 \u00bb video ______________ The video is a collage of clips from all 13 videos that were presented on their own media at Computering, an exhibition at Kino \u0160i\u0161ka\u2019s gallery. In the mash-up video technique, which has spread extensively with the phenomenon of mass image sharing on the internet, it focuses on the shots that include a computer. In addition to the experience of contemporary visual culture, the work also offers the starting points for the questioning of the role of the author and cultural appropriation in the contemporary world.     Memory Machine Kristina Kokalj, Slovenia, 2018, digital, 4:3, 4\u2019 25\u201d \u00bb video ______________ The video is a collage of black-and-white images shot on 35mm analogue film. The images follow one another at a rapid pace and, according to the principle of stop-motion animation, create the illusion of flickering and hectic movement. The images of nature (treetops, branches) and urban landscape (street lights, graffiti, fences, roads) are intertwined. Open aperture shots produce a branch-like linear light drawing that transitions and flashes alternately with close-ups of bare branches. The stroboscopic flashes of images are accompanied by Klemen Tehovnik\u2019s original music and emphasise temporariness, fragmentation and anxiety.     Videographics 19 Borut Savski, Slovenia, 2007, 4:3, 4\u2019 23\u201d \u00bb video ______________ Videographics are modern experimental narratives in which the image acts as a sound marker. Images are abstract and the connection between video and audio is direct, even though it does not follow any logic. A video graphics is a materialisation of an audio signal and an integral part of the experimental context.     Liquid Solidity Ur\u0161ula Berlot, Sun\u010dana Kulji\u0161 Gaillot, Slovenia, 2017, HD, 5\u2019 6\u201d \u00bb video ______________ This digital animation is based on the idea of simulating life at the molecular level. It shows a round shape in the process of constant transformation. A structure that alternately resembles the composition of viruses, complex proteins and carbon fullerenes is being decomposed, transformed and re-shaped in a string of ordering processes. The soundtrack was made by Scanner (Robin Rimbaud).     NO.4 (SONAR) Agnes Momirski, Slovenia, 2017, HD, 3\u2019 33\u201d \u00bb video ______________ A music video for Sontag Shogun no.4 (Sonar) from the Patterns For Resonant Space LP. In collaboration with Brencha (Brina Vidic \u2013 costume design).     Nightmares of the New World Nata\u0161a Prosenc Stearns, USA, 2017, HD, 7\u2019 31\u201d \u00bb video ______________ A series of three single-channel videos: Humans Crossing, Deafening Whispers\/Alternative Facts, Nucleus Brass. The world is being ruined by overpopulation, the deafening processes of destruction and people\u2019s outrageous audacity.     Sky In Ruins (di sotto in s\u00f9) Sa\u0161o Sedla\u010dek, Slovenia, 2016, HD, 3\u2019 40\u201d ______________ This dystopian visual illusion that alludes to the tradition of Renaissance ceiling painting opens a window into the nearby cosmos, where, in the blackness of the orbits along which satellites circle the Earth, there is far more space trash than satellites. Despite its vastness, the universe is not so unlimited that humans could simply continue spreading their bad earthly habits out into space without any ecological consequences. The 3D animation was made with the open source software Blender. The video installation was presented at the 8th Triennial of Contemporary Art \u2013 U3, at the Museum of Modern Art Ljubljana.     Galapagos Damjan Kracina, Vladimir Leben, Slovenia, 2005, 4:3, 5\u2019 39\u201d \u00bb video ______________ The video was created for a joint eponymous exhibition project by both artists. The close-ups of an installation of the Galapagos Islands with a volcano are followed by motifs of individual animal species from the paintings of Vladimir Leben. The video includes a clip from the video Ape Boys, which is followed by shots of the sculptures and drawings of fictitious animal species created by Damijan Kracina. The artists share an examination of issues related to animals, their rights and characteristics, and a good sense of humour and the absurd.     Postaja DIVA is a online and physical archive that the Centre for Contemporary Arts SCCA-Ljubljana has been developing since 2005 in order to research, document, archive and present art films, videos and new media art.     Friday, 9 July, 19.00     deskt0p_cinema     Compiled by: Greg de Cuir Jr. Duration: 70\u2032 Free tickets     This programme takes the form of a projector performance or, better yet, an interface performance, in which the platform is both an artistic tool and a canvas: the desktop display. The desktop as material, as editing suite, as camera, as projection mechanism \u2013 as perhaps the most consequential surface that touches countless people every day across the globe. Practiced by visual artists to challenge conventional forms of expression, used by academics to present and perform new modes of research, by film critics to engage with their objects of contemplation, and by legions of nonprofessionals who distribute all types of user-generated content online. Desktop cinema deletes divisions of high and low, commercial and non, film and video. It is the lingua franca of the 21st century. This projection performance will take a short journey through the various aesthetic and technological contours of the art of the desktop.     Programme will be performed by Greg de Cuir Jr.     Greg de Cuir Jr. is the selector of the Alternative Film\/Video festival in Belgrade. As an independent curator, he has prepared several video and film programmes at various international institutions. He is the editor-in-chief of NECSUS: European Journal of Media Studies and the book series Eastern European Screen Cultures. He writes specialist texts for magazines and publications. He obtained his PhD from the Faculty of Dramatic Arts, University of Arts in Belgrade.     Friday, 9 July, 21.00     Retrospective: Ema Kugler     People made of flesh and blood are captured in the mythic matrices of civilisation or the stifling laws of society that they themselves write. The tight (but also astonishing and practically palpable) frameworks can be transcended only by experiment that equals progress and destruction that creates a space for something new.     This programme is the beginning of the retrospective of Ema Kugler\u2019s films, which will take place in autumn at the Slovenian Cinematheque.     The programme will be presented by Ema Kugler.     The Visitior Ema Kugler, Slovenia, 1995, DCP (shot on Beta SP \u2013 digital mastering), 4:3, 27\u2019 \u00bb video ______________ The artist insists on the duality of human nature: the same dreadfulness is part of both the mythical and the real world. The duality is explicitly presented by means of electronic effects that can petrify a human face, or wall-up a human body in a few seconds. Human figures dressed in extravagant costumes are returned back to nature by means of electronic effects: a man in a costume reminiscent of a bird transforms into a real bird. The costumed and real birds are accentuated by the bird\u2019s eye view, which always emphasises man\u2019s smallness and forlornness in his own world and within nature.     Taiga Ema Kugler, Slovenia, 1996, DCP (shot on Beta SP \u2013 digital mastering), 4:3, 8\u2019 \u00bb video ______________ Video Taiga is made after eponymous performance carried out at the international festival of contemporary arts City of women in October 1995 in Ljubljana. Taiga is a dark video landscape with human figures in menacing costumes, but it also includes two almost naked fighters and a drowning woman. Wax dogs add to the coldness of the video taiga; they actually melt away, while the electronic effect only serves to accelerate the process. The essence of taiga is the act of destruction, or transition. The destruction of art form creates a new, entirely different pattern. The transition becomes an event with a message. Sculptures are the landmarks of the beginning and of the end.     Menhir Ema Kugler, Slovenia, 1999, DCP (shot on Beta SP \u2013 digital mastering), 4:3, 35\u2019 \u00bb video ______________ Urbanity is finally erased with mythological rituals, which is defined by the title of the video film: menhir, a large upright standing stone from the Neolithic Period which was used in sacred rituals. A man and a woman are Adam and Eve who are formed before us with electronic transformation (morphing) and are marked by blood, which also marks all the other elements of the video image: murder of an individual committed by a menhir or the trinity (politics, church, army), bodies of dancers. Blood, murder and death are only beaten by the second basic element: stone which is in the next moment drenched in blood. Electronic tricks, which turn rulers from flesh and blood into stone and vice versa, also act in the battle between natural elements.     Ema Kugler is a film director, producer and multidisciplinary artist with a distinctly unique authorial poetics. Since the 1990s, she has created a series of performances, films, installations and auteur videos that are a product of complex narratives, perfected scripts and original costume and set designs. She has received numerous Slovenian and international awards and prizes.

Za kulturni spomenik dr\u017eavnega pomena je razgla\u0161en vodni tok reke Ljubljanice in Male Ljubljanice z obre\u017eji od izvirov v Mo\u010dilniku in Retovju do razvodja Ljubljanice in Gruberjevega kanala na \u0160pici v Ljubljani. Spomeniku pripada \u0161e del reke Ljubije na Vrhniki do soto\u010dja z Ljubljanico ter raz\u0161irjeno obmo\u010dje spomenika med Kaminom pri Bevkah in ledino Livada pri Podpe\u010di.Doslej je bilo v strugi Ljubljanice in njenih pritokih odkritih \u017ee preko 8000 predmetov iz razli\u010dnih \u010dasovnih obdobij. V bre\u017eino struge pri Verdu je \u0161e vedno ujeta edinstvena rimska tovorna ladja iz 1. stoletja. Skrivnostna reka in njeni nepojasnjeni pojavi so bili v preteklosti navdih \u0161tevilnim mitom in legendam, kot prepoznavna veduta pokrajine in mest je tudi pogost motiv umetni\u0161kih upodobitev. V obdobjih prvih poselitev je slu\u017eila predvsem za hitro in varno komunikacijo, po izgradnji cest in \u017eeleznice ter obse\u017ene urbanizacije pa je prevzela vlogo priro\u010dnega odpadnega kanala. Kulturni spomenik je trenutno najbolj ogro\u017een na obmo\u010dju Verda, kjer zaradi spodjedanja neutrjene bre\u017eine grozi uni\u010denje dvema ploviloma iz rimskega obdobja. Ker gre v obeh primerih za izjemno redke ostanke iz mo\u010dno degradiranih materialov arheolo\u0161kega mokrega lesa, ki se ohranijo izklju\u010dno v mokrem okolju, bi bila \u0161koda ob morebitnem uni\u010denju neprecenljiva. Za\u0161\u010dita tovrstnih spomenikov je zelo kompleksna, ve\u010dji problem pa predstavlja \u0161e velika dimenzija objektov in zahtevna podvodna dela. V neposredni bli\u017eini rimske ladje je bila odkrita tudi najstarej\u0161a lesena konica na svetu, stara okoli 40 000 let. Obmo\u010dje pore\u010dja Ljubljanice ima izjemen potencial na podro\u010dju kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine, dostopnost do nje pa je parcialna in premalo izkori\u0161\u010dena. Posamezne dejavnosti in projekti, ki so bili izvedeni v preteklem obdobju, so preve\u010d razpr\u0161eni in nepovezani. Prav tako je zaznati pomanjkanje dolgoro\u010dnih usmeritev, ki temeljijo na strokovnosti in temeljnem poslanstvu ohranjanja dedi\u0161\u010dine za bodo\u010de generacije ter kvalitetne prezentacije za lokalne prebivalce in turiste, ki bi posledi\u010dno pripomogle k razvoju regije in kvalitetnej\u0161emu \u017eivljenju lokalnih prebivalcev, hkrati pa bi spodbudile razvoj turisti\u010dne dejavnosti in drugih storitvenih dejavnosti. Trend zadnjega desetletja nakazuje obse\u017eno priseljevanje v ljubljanske primestne ob\u010dine z dnevnimi migracijami v prestolnico ter konstantno pove\u010devanje turisti\u010dnega obiska, ki pa je omejen na kratek obisk uveljavljenih turisti\u010dnih destinacij s prete\u017eno vodenimi skupinami. Prav pomanjkanje kompleksnej\u0161e ponudbe za razli\u010dne ciljne publike z mre\u017eenjem posameznih vsebin onemogo\u010da dalj\u0161e zadr\u017eevanje obiskovalcev na tem obmo\u010dju, novo nastala poselitev pa spreminja kraje z bogato tradicijo v spalna naselja prestolnice. Ozave\u0161\u010danje lokalne javnosti s posebnim poudarkom na vzgoji in izobra\u017eevanju ter kvalitetnemu pre\u017eivljanju prostega \u010dasa je zato predpogoj za krepitev identitete kraja, hkrati pa odpira nove mo\u017enosti za razvoj turizma ter o\u017eivljanja starih obrti in lokalnih tradicij. Omogo\u010da tudi kvalitetnej\u0161e varovanje in ohranjanje dedi\u0161\u010dine kot lastne vrednote in potenciala za bodo\u010de generacije. Prepoznavnost Vrhnike je danes razpr\u0161ena med ve\u010d tradicij, med katerimi izstopajo Argonavti (mit), Ivan Cankar (rojstni kraj pisatelja), izviri Ljubljanice (Bistra, Mo\u010dilnik) in industrializacija po drugi svetovni vojni (IUV, LIKO,..). Ljubljanica kot edini tovrstni spomenik naravne in kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine dr\u017eavnega pomena v Sloveniji, z edinstveno in \u0161iroko paleto potencialov (reka sedmerih imen, kra\u0161ki svet, Ljubljansko barje, podvodna arheologija, razvoj mesta skozi razli\u010dna zgodovinska obdobja kot posledica prehodnosti prostora in komunikacij po Ljubljanici,\u2026) je popolnoma zanemarjena, hkrati pa zdru\u017euje vse zgoraj omenjene podobe trenutne prepoznavnosti.Lega Vrhnike in njen potencial sta optimalna dejavnika za razvoj turizma v naj\u0161ir\u0161em pomenu besede: na sredini poti med dvema najbolj obiskanima turisti\u010dnima destinacijama (Postojnska jama in Ljubljana), vpeta med vse tri spomenike, ki so razgla\u0161eni na svetovni seznam dedi\u0161\u010dine UNESCO (\u0160kocjanske jame, Idrija, Ljubljansko barje \u2013 koli\u0161\u010da) in potencialom, da to postane tudi sama (Ljubljanica) ter obse\u017enimi infrastrukturnimi mo\u017enostmi za razvoj turizma ob glavni avtocestni povezavi s katerimi je omogo\u010dena tudi revitalizacija degradiranih obmo\u010dij, ki so posledica propada ve\u010djih industrijskih obratov in posledi\u010dno trajnostni razvoj kraja in \u0161ir\u0161ega zaledja. Za\u0161\u010dita dedi\u0161\u010dine brez revitalizacije, ki je usmerjena v sodobne in aktualne tokove vsakdanjega \u017eivljenja, je nesmiselna in vodi v nadaljnje propadanje, zato je upo\u0161tevanje dostopnosti do dedi\u0161\u010dine skozi razli\u010dne metode komuniciranja klju\u010dnega pomena pri prijavljenem projektu. Poseben poudarek je namenjen sinergiji naravne in kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine, ki predstavlja dodaten potencial za \u0161irjenje dostopnosti. Prispevek projekta k re\u0161evanju problematike Projekt obsega prvo fazo \u0161ir\u0161ega in celovitega projekta revitalizacije kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine Vrhnike, katerega temeljni cilj je varovanje, ohranjanje, prezentacijain maksimalna dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine z dolgoro\u010dnimi u\u010dinki na dru\u017ebeni in trajnostni razvoj v lokalnem, nacionalnem in svetovnem kontekstu ter kvalitetna ponudba za prebivalce kraja ter doma\u010de in tuje obiskovalce. S prijavljenim projektom re\u0161ujemo najbolj akutno ogro\u017eenost edinstvenega spomenika v Sloveniji, ki mu zaradi lege, stopnje degradacije in vrste materiala grozi uni\u010denje. Na podlagi rezultatov predhodnih arheolo\u0161kih raziskav in projekta za sanacijo desne bre\u017eine Ljubljanice bomo izvedli za\u0161\u010ditorimske ladje, ki se po kulturnovarstvenih smernicah ohranja in situ ter premestitev ostankov \u010dolna \u2013 deblaka, ki ga bomo dvignili iz ogro\u017eene lokacije ter za\u0161\u010ditili z aktivno konservacijo in mikroklimatsko komoro, kar bo poleg ohranjanja omogo\u010dilo tudi razstavljanje objekta. S sanacijo bre\u017eine bomo dolgoro\u010dno za\u0161\u010ditili kulturni spomenik v \u0161ir\u0161em obmo\u010dju, hkrati pa prepre\u010dili potencialno uni\u010denje rimske ladje in ekolo\u0161ko katastrofo ob mo\u017eni poru\u0161itvi bre\u017eine in izlitju vode iz enega od ribnikov opu\u0161\u010denih glinokopov na Verdu v Ljubljanico. Na podlagi testnih rezultatov bomo s pilotnim projektom rednega monitoringa, vzor\u010denja in analiz spremljali mikrobiolo\u0161ke in fizikalno-kemijske vplive okolja na rimsko ladjo v Ljubljanici in vzorce lesa v depozitoriju. Dobljeni rezultati bodo namenjeni spremljanju stanja rimske ladje in situ in ustvarjanju mo\u017enosti za trajno hranjenje najbolj ogro\u017eenih spomenikov iz mokrega lesa v depozitoriju ter pripravi standardov za upravljanje tovrstne dedi\u0161\u010dine. Poleg prioritetne za\u0161\u010dite najbolj ogro\u017eenega delaspomenika, bomo v projektu najve\u010djo pozornost namenili dostopnosti do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine, mre\u017eenju v \u0161ir\u0161em prostoru ter o\u017eivljanju degradiranih obmo\u010dij, ki poleg revitalizacije prina\u0161ajo \u0161e dodaten potencial za \u0161irjenje dejavnosti (razvoj turisti\u010dnih dejavnosti, kreativnih industrij, storitvenih dejavnosti,programov za robne in ranljive skupine, vzgojno in izobra\u017eevalno dejavnost za mlade in starej\u0161e, o\u017eivitev tradicionalnih obrti in nesnovne dedi\u0161\u010dine, znanstveno raziskovalno dejavnost ter posledi\u010dno omogo\u010dili gospodarski razvoj in nova delovna mesta). S tem bodo omogo\u010deni tudi pogoji za kvalitetnej\u0161e varovanje in ohranjanje kulturnega spomenika za bodo\u010de generacije. Do\u017eivljajsko razstavi\u0161\u010de Ljubljanica bo ume\u0161\u010deno v sredi\u0161\u010de Vrhnike, saj neposredna lokacija kulturnega spomenika ni primerna (reka, naravovarstveno obmo\u010dje, infrastruktura) in ne omogo\u010da dostopnosti za naj\u0161ir\u0161o javnost. Objekt, ki je namenjen kulturnim in izobra\u017eevalnim programom, je \u017ee v fazi energetske sanacije, zato so stro\u0161ki izvedbe bistveno ni\u017eji in obsegajo izklju\u010dno vlaganje v prostor za potrebe razstave. Kompleksna vsebina razvoja vrhni\u0161kega prostora iz perspektive reke Ljubljanice bo predstavljena nivojsko in ve\u010dplastno za razli\u010dne ciljne publike. Poseben poudarek bo namenjen dinamiki ogleda (slika, zvok, taktili, interakcija, svetlobni in vodni efekti) in sodobnim muzeolo\u0161kim standardom. Izku\u0161nja obiskovalca bo ve\u010dplastna in abstraktno uokvirja tri svetove, ki jih definira prostor reke, kot nosilne gradnike razstave: svet spodaj (podvodni svet, podzemni svet krasa, prostor arheologije, prostor neznanega); svet gladine (nivo vmes, prehajanje iz enega sveta v drugega, ravnina\/tok vode - tok \u010dasa); svet zgoraj (svet ob reki, svet ljudi, svet znanega). Z izvedbo prijavljenega projekta se bomo bistveno pribli\u017eali zadanim ciljem celovitega projekta revitalizacije kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine: - Za\u0161\u010diten, obnovljen in kvalitetno upravljan edinstveni kulturni spomenik dr\u017eavnega pomena. - Prepoznavna celostna podoba spomenika, ki zagotavlja usmeritev v trajnostni razvoj in omogo\u010da izdelavo dolgoro\u010dnih strategij s podro\u010dja varovanja in ohranjanja kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter njihovo prezentacijo in popularizacijo za naj\u0161ir\u0161o doma\u010do in tujo javnost. - Pove\u010dana dostopnost do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter ustvarjen potencial za izobra\u017eevalne, vzgojne, prosto\u010dasne in turisti\u010dne dejavnosti, za razvoj kreativnih industrij, ohranjanje starih obrti in nesnovne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter s tem zvi\u0161ana kvaliteta \u017eivljenja v mestu in \u0161ir\u0161i regiji ter ustvarjena nova delovna mesta. - Vzpostavljena povezava med dvema najbolj obiskanima turisti\u010dnima destinacijama v Sloveniji (Postojna \u2013 Ljubljana) in omre\u017eene lokacije v pore\u010dju Ljubljanice s kvalitetno, interaktivno in do\u017eivljajsko to\u010dko v sredi\u0161\u010du Vrhnike. Dopolnjena ponudba prestolnice in omogo\u010deno dalj\u0161e bivanje turistovna Vrhniki. - Revitalizirano degradirano urbano obmo\u010dje, ki je zaradi razvojnih gibanj zapu\u0161\u010deno in zaostalo v razvoju. Z izvedbo projekta Do\u017eivljajsko razstavi\u0161\u010de Ljubljanica bomo ustvarili u\u010dinkovito platformo za realizacijo ostalih faz celovitega projekta v prihodnosti. Bilateralno sodelovanje z eno od partneric EGP smo na\u010drtovali z raziskovalci Norgesteknisk-naturvitenskapeligeuniversitet in NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet iz Norve\u0161ke, ki se v sklopu mednarodnega projekta RAAR (2003\u20132050) ukvarjajo z ohranjanjem in preme\u0161\u010danjem spomenikov iz mokrega lesa v morskem okolju. Zaradi kratkega prijavnega roka se \u017eal niso pozitivno odzvali. Ker prijavljen projekt na\u010drtuje zelo specifi\u010dne posege (delno pilotne tudi v svetovnem merilu), bi vsako drugo sodelovanje v tej fazi pomenilo zgolj formalnost, zato se zanj nismo odlo\u010dili. Cilji projekta Splo\u0161ni cilj projekta Kulturna dedi\u0161\u010dina obnovljena, restavrirana in za\u0161\u010ditena. Specifi\u010dni cilji Eden od specifi\u010dnih ciljev projekta je vzpostavitev sinergi\u010dnih u\u010dinkovin pove\u010dana dostopnost do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine kot celote. S tem bo omogo\u010dena ve\u010dja prepoznavnost dedi\u0161\u010dine \u0161ir\u0161e regije doma\u010dim in tujim obiskovalcem. Pore\u010dje Ljubljanice je javnosti manj znano predvsem v kra\u0161kem svetu (ponikalnica), nekoliko bolj znani so izviri na Mo\u010dilniku in Retovju. Bogato kulturno dedi\u0161\u010dino (UNESCO \u2013 koli\u0161\u010da, Nauportus, \u2026) dopolnjuje tudi naravna dedi\u0161\u010dina Ljubljanskega barja (Natura 2000, Krajinski park). Specifi\u010dni cilj predstavlja iskanje dolgoro\u010dnih re\u0161itev na podro\u010dju za\u0161\u010dite in ohranjanja dedi\u0161\u010dine iz mokrega lesa zmonitoringi in analizami mikrobiolo\u0161kih in fizikalno-kemijskih dejavnikov okolja. V projektu se poleg akutnega re\u0161evanja najbolj ogro\u017eene dedi\u0161\u010dine v strugi Ljubljanice vzpostavlja trajnostni sistem hranjenja v mokrem okolju (premestitev \/ depozitorij), ki bo bistveno pripomogel k ve\u010djim mo\u017enostim za dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine tudi bodo\u010dim generacijam. Specifi\u010dni cilj predstavlja tudi dostopnost do kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine, ki je bila pridobljena s postopkom abolicije in izvira iz struge Ljubljanice. Namen abolicije je bil poleg dokumentiranja in pravilnega hranjenja predmetov, tudi \u010dim hitrej\u0161a dostopnost do te dedi\u0161\u010dine. V do\u017eivljajskem razstavi\u0161\u010du bodo razstavljeni in interpretirani \u0161tevilni tovrstni predmeti. Ciljne skupine Vsi rezultati projekta so namenjeni naj\u0161ir\u0161i javnosti, z iskanjem dolgoro\u010dnih re\u0161itev pa \u017eelimo dose\u010di predvsem trajnostne u\u010dinke, ki bodo omogo\u010dili dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine tudi bodo\u010dim generacijam. Ozave\u0161\u010danje lokalne javnosti je ena od temeljnih nalog projekta. Z vsebinami in programi, ki segajo v \u0161ir\u0161e obmo\u010dje pore\u010dja Ljubljanice ustvarjamo potencial za razvoj turizma in \u0161irjenje ciljnih publik. Osrednja informacijska to\u010dka z do\u017eivljajskim razstavi\u0161\u010dem je namenjena prevladujo\u010dim in robnim ciljnim publikam, ki jih \u017eelimo spodbuditi k aktivnemu sodelovanju in na\u010drtnemu razvijanju skupne odgovornosti za dedi\u0161\u010dino. S povezovanjem strokovnjakov in vklju\u010devanjem lai\u010dne javnosti ter mre\u017eenjem kakovostnih programov bomo vzpostavili izmenjavo znanja in spretnosti, vrednot in pogledov ter dolgoro\u010dno povezovanje v lokalnem, nacionalnem in mednarodnem prostoru. Z razli\u010dnimi metodami komuniciranja (interakcije, sodobne tehnologije, taktili, atraktivni vodni elementi, eksperimentalne delavnice, programi, dogodki) bomo nagovarjali posamezne starostne in interesne skupine. Posebna pozornost bo s prilagojeno opremo in aktivnim vklju\u010devanjem namenjena ranljivim skupinam in obiskovalcem s posebnimi potrebami. Rezultati za\u0161\u010dite spomenika in analiz bodo dostopne \u017ee v \u010dasu trajanja projekta tako strokovni kot tudi lai\u010dni javnosti.

Dopolnil bo ponudbo prestolnice in omogo\u010dil dalj\u0161e bivanje obiskovalcev tudi izven Ljubljane \u2013 na Vrhniki. Ustvaril bo potencial za razvoj kreativnih industrij, \u0161olskih in ob\u0161olskih dejavnosti in turisti\u010dnih dejavnosti ter s tem zvi\u0161al kvaliteto \u017eivljenja v mestu in \u0161ir\u0161i regiji ter ustvaril nova delovna mesta. Partnerji PARTNER1 Naziv institucije: Muzej in galerije mesta Ljubljana Status: pravna oseba javnega prava Naslov: Gosposka ulica 15 Po\u0161tna \u0161tevilka: 1000 Kraj: Ljubljana Dr\u017eava: Slovenija Prispevek partnerja k projektu: Muzej in galerije mesta Ljubljana je poobla\u0161\u010deni muzej za obmo\u010dje Vrhnike. Skladno s poslanstvom in strategijo je v letu 2013 izdelal idejni projekt celovite revitalizacije kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine Vrhnike, na podlagi katerega je bil kot prioritetna faza pripravljen projekt Do\u017eivljajsko razstavi\u0161\u010de Ljubljanica. V letu 2012 je vodil projekt vzpostavitve dr\u017eavnega depozitorija na Verdu in sodeloval pri arheolo\u0161kih raziskavah rimske ladje v strugi Ljubljanice, v letu 2013 pa vodil projekt monitoringa testnih vzorcev v depozitoriju. Ogro\u017eenost kulturnega spomenika ter izjemen potencial spomenika za prezentacijo sta bila izhodi\u0161\u010di za pripravo vsebinskih izhodi\u0161\u010d za prijavljen projekt. Muzej in galerije mesta Ljubljane bo pri projektu aktivno sodeloval v vseh fazah in podro\u010djih dela. Dejavnosti, ki jih izvaja po pooblastilu Ministrstva za kulturo, bo izvedel v sklopu rednih dejavnosti (evidentiranje, dokumentiranje, pridobivanje, prou\u010devanje). Projektno delo pa obsega vsebinsko in strokovno vodenje in koordiniranje projekta pri arheolo\u0161kih raziskavah, aktivni konservaciji, izvedbi razstave in monitoringih; pripravo vsebinskih izhodi\u0161\u010d za izdelavo projektne dokumentacije in razpise javnega naro\u010danja, vsebinsko zasnovo razstave s scenariji, besedili in izborom slikovnega in filmskega gradiva, aktivno konservacijo predmetov za razstavljanje, koordinacijo zunanjih izvajalcev pri konservaciji mokrega lesa, monta\u017eo in mikroklimatske pogoje muzejskih predmetov ter koordinacijo monitoringov z vzor\u010denji.

BASIC INFORMATION Project title: Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site Project acronym: Ljubljanica Programme: EEA Financial Mechanism 2009-2014 Area of the call in Set B: Cultural Heritage 2. PROJECT SUMMARY Besides being natural attraction, the Ljubljanica River is also famous for itscultural heritage. The riverbed between Vrhnika and Ljubljana is classified as one of the most important of its kindin terms of abundance, quality and scientific value of the findings. But it is also one of the country\u2019s most endangered cultural monuments. There is a unique ancient Roman cargo ship dating from the 1st Centuy AD trapped near the village of Verd, threatened to be destroyed by the erosion. Through our project its most vulnerable parts shall not only be protected, but also expertly preserved and made available to a large audience. Our further objective is to allow a considerably easier access to the cultural heritage and natural attractions of the Ljubljanica River for the public. This interactive experience and exhibition site located in downtown Vrhnika has been designed to encourage the public, including vulnerable groups, to activelyparticipate in strengthening common responsibility for heritage and for developmentof tourism, creative industries, revival of old crafts and local traditions. The present scheme is here to create a network and synergies between both cultural and natural heritage preservation activities within the Ljubljanica basin. This project is about an efficient platform for a revitalisation of heritage in Vrhnika and the wider region. 3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Justification of the project Because of abundance, quality and scientific value of its findings, the Ljubljanica riverbed between Vrhnika and Ljubljana is classified as one the most important, but also the highest endangered archaeological sites in Slovenia. The water flow of both the Ljubljanica and Mala Ljubljanica Rivers from their sources at Mo\u010dilnik and Retovje, up to the Ljubljanica and Gruber\u2019s Channel watersheds at \u0160pica is declared cultural monument of national significance. Part of the Ljubija River (Vrhnika) and the area between Kamin, and the Livada fallow, are complementing this monument. So far more than 8000 ancient items have been found here. The unique ancient Roman cargo ship from the 1st century AD is still being trapped near Verd. The mysterious river and its unexplained phenomena have inspired many myths and legends in the past. It has also served as a frequent motif of art. Once primarily used as a means of communication, the river has assumed role of a convenient waste channel following the large-scale urbanisation. This monument is presently most endangered in the area around Verd. The erosion is threatening two ancient Roman vessels. Both are extremely rare residues of badly deteriorated materials - archaeological wet wood that can only be preserved in wet conditions. In case of their destruction the damage would be priceless. It is an extremely delicate and complex task to protect these findings. Their dimensions and the necessary underwater interventions present a major challenge. An additional finding has been discovered in their immediate vicinity: the world\u2019s oldest wooden tip of some 40 000 years. The area of the Ljubljanica basin has great potential in terms of cultural and natural heritage, which at the moment is under-exploited. Specific activities have so far been running too scattered and unrelated and in a lack of long-term orientation, based on expertise and fundamental mission to conserve heritage for future generations including public presentations, all contributing to an improved quality of life of local residents. Service sector and tourism would thereby be encouraged. Massive Immigration to Ljubljana\u2019s suburban has shown in the last decade, causing daily commuting to and from the Capital. Meanwhile, tourist visits are limited to daily trips by guided groups to the famous destinations. Due to the lack of a more complex and differently targeted offer by means of networking a prolonged stay of visitors in this area is prevented. Meanwhile the recent immigration trends are converting these places to the Capital\u2019s dormitories. Promoting quality leisure time and encouraging local community\u2019s awareness are of crucial importance for the area\u2019s identity. At the same time, these activities contribute to new opportunities for local tourism and revitalisation of old crafts and local traditions. It also enables a more efficient protection and preservation of heritage as own value and potential for future generations. Visibility of Vrhnika is suffering from being scattered among its various traditions, such as the Argonauts (myth), Ivan Cankar (writer\u2019s birthplace), the Ljubljanica sources (Bistra, Mo\u010dilnik) and post-World War II industry. Neglected is the Ljubljanica River as the country\u2019s only natural and cultural heritage monument of this type - despite its unique and rich potentials (River of seven names, Karst, Ljubljana Marshes, underwater archaeology, town\u2019s history, etc). are combined by the river. The position of Vrhnika is optimal for tourism in the broadest sense. Located right in the middle between two most frequently visited destinations (Postojna Cave and Ljubljana), and between the three monumental sites listed as world heritage by UNESCO (\u0160kocjan caves, Idrija, Ljubljana Marshes pile dwellings), thanks to the Ljubljanica River the town has great potential to become one by itself. Further great infrastructural opportunities come from its location near the main motorway link, also encouraging a sustainable development of the town including the hinterland, and, finally, revitalisation of areas heavily deteriorated. Protection of heritage without revitalisation focused on modern and current trends of everyday life is meaningless and may lead to further deterioration. Therefore, taking into consideration the accessibility of heritage through a variety of communication methods is crucial for the project. Special emphasis is placed on synergy between natural and cultural heritage as an additional potential for widening the access. Contribution of the project to solving the issue The project represents the first phase of a broader and integrated project of revitalization of cultural and natural heritage of Vrhnika. Its objective is to protect, preserve, and present the heritage, but also to provide maximum accessibility and thereby long-term effects on a sustainable social development in the local, national and global context - including quality offer for the local residents, domestic and international visitors. The project as applied has a mission to solve the most acute threat to the unique monument in Slovenia, threatened due to its location, degree of degradation and type of soil material. Based on the results of previous archaeological research work and the Project for the Rehabilitation of the Right Bank of the Ljubljanica River, we shall conduct both the preservation of the ancient Roman ship which -following the guidelines of cultural protection - shall remain in situand the relocation of the trunk boat residues. The latter shall be raised from its threatened location and protected by using special active conservation methods and microclimatic chamber, allowing the exhibition of the object in addition to its preservation. Through the rehabilitation of the bank, we intend to provide long-term protect to this culturalmonument within an extended area, but also to prevent the Roman ship from its possible destruction. An environmental disaster provoked by the possible collapse of the embankment and the escape of water from one of the ponds belonging to the abandoned clay pits located at Verd into the Ljubljanica shall thereby also be prevented. Based on testresults we shall conduct a pilotproject of regular monitoring, sampling and analyses to monitor microbiological, physical and chemical impact of the environment on the Roman ship both in the Ljubljanica and its wood samples stored in the depository. The results obtained shall be used to monitor the state of the ship in situand create the necessary conditions to preserve the most endangered items from wet wood stored in the depositoryand standards of managing heritage of this type. In addition to the priority of protecting the most threatened part of monument, great attention shall be placed on accessibility of our cultural and natural heritage to a large audience, networking within an extended area and revitalisation of deteriorated areas, bearing additional potential for expansion in terms of tourism, creative businesses, service sector, dedicated programs for marginal and vulnerable groups, educational contents for both young and elderly, revival of traditional crafts and intangible heritage, research and development. Providing an improved prospective of economic development and new employments shall lead to a considerably improved level of protection and preservation of the cultural monument for future generations. The Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site shall be placed right in the centre of Vrhnika, since the the monument\u2019s direct location is less suitable - location at river, within an environmentally protected areaposing infrastructural issues - and would allow a much lessee accessibility to great public. The premise intended for cultural and educational programs is already being subject to energy rehabilitation, so the implementation costs are expected to be much lower and only limited to the investment in the exhibition space. The complex content on the development of the Vrhnika area from the prospective of the Ljubljanica River shall be presented multi-level and multi-layered, adjusted to various target groups. Particular emphasis will be placed on the dynamics of visit (image, sound, clocking, interaction, light- and water-effects) and modern museum standards. The visitor\u2019s experience shall be provided multi-layered in shall in an abstract way framed by three worlds, defined by the river as carrier vehicle of the exhibition: the world below (underwater world, Karst underworld, space dedicated to archaeology, space dedicated to the unknown); the world on the surface (the level in-between, transition from one world to another, the plane \/ flow of the river - flow of the time); the world above (world on the river, world of the people, world of the known). The implementation of the project applied shall bring us much closer to the objectives of the Overall Project of Revitalisation of Cultural and Natural Heritage: - Protected, restored and managed unique quality cultural monument of national importance. - A distinctive comprehensive identity of the monument, which provides guidance on sustainable development and enables producing long-term strategies in the field of protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage as well as their presentation and popularisation for the broadest domestic and international audiences. - Improved access to cultural and natural heritage, potential for educational activities, leisure and tourism businesses, developing creative industries, preserving old crafts and intangible heritage as well as improving quality of life in the city and the wider region with new employments as a result. - Connection established between two of the most visited tourist destinations in Slovenia (Postojna - Ljubljana), networking between locations within the Ljubljanica basin with high quality, interactive and experiential focus point at Vrhnika. Improved offering capacities of the Capital allowing tourists to stay longer in Vrhnika. - Revitalised previously deteriorated urban area, abandoned and lagging behind due to unfavourable economic trends. By implementing of the Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site Projectan efficient platform shall be set-up as basis to achieve further phases of the Overall Project in the future. Bilateral collaboration with Norway, one of the EEA members, has been planned together with the researchers at the Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet in NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet, active in preservation and relocalion of wet-wood-monuments in maritime areas within the RAAR International Project (2003\u20132050). Due to the short application deadline they have unfortunately been unable to respond positively. Since very specific interventions are planned by the project applied (partly pilot projects on the global level), any other partnership would only be formality at this stage, which is why we haven\u2019t opted for such a solution. Objectives of the project General objectives of the project Cultural heritage restored, renovated and protected. Specific objectives One of the specific objectives of the project is to create synergy effects and increased access to cultural and natural heritage as a whole. This will enable greater visibility of the heritage of the wider region for both domestic and international visitors. The Ljubljanica is especially less known to the large public in the Karst area (disappearing underground stream), somehow better known are sources at Mo\u010dilnik and Retovje. The roich cultural heritage (UNESCO \u2013 pile dwellings, Nauportus, etc) are complemented by the natural heritageof the Ljubljana Marshes (Barje, Natura 2000, Nature Park). The specific objective is to find long-term solutions in the field of protection and conservation of heritage items from wet wood by continuous monitoring and analyses of microbiological, physical and chemical environmental elements. In addition to acute rescue of the most endangered heritage in the Ljubljanica Riverbed, the projectshall establish a sustainable system of storage in a wet environment (relocation \/ depository), contributing significantly to improved access options to heritage for future generations. The specific objective is also access to cultural heritage originating from the Ljubljanica riverbed and obtained by abolition. In addition to the documentation and proper storage of items the goal of abolition has been to allow quick access to the heritage. Numerous items of this type shall be exhibited and interpreted at the described Experience and Exhibition Site. Target groups All results of the project are aimed at the general public. It is mainly sustained effects what we are strive to achieve searching for long-term solutions focused access to the heritage of future generations. Raising awareness of the local community is one of the fundamental tasks of the project. The content and programs that concern the wider Ljubljanica area create the potential for tourism development and expansion of target audiences. Central information point with an adventurous Exhibition is intended to dominant edge groups and audience, targeted to be encouraged in sense of an active participation and to systematically develop a shared responsibility for heritage. By bringing together experts, integrating the lay public and by networking all those quality programs the exchange of knowledge and skills, values and attitudes as well as long-term integration of local, national and international arena shall be established. By following various methods of communication (interaction modern technologies, strokes, attractive aquatic features, experimental workshops, programs, events) each age and interest group shall fell addressed. By using customized programs and encouraging active involvement special attention will be paid to vulnerable groups and visitors with special needs. Results in terms of protection of monuments and analyses will be available to both the professional as well as the general public already during the project running.

        "text":" Increasing the energy efficiency of injection molding process (Joint R2B Innovation voucher under OISAIR Project)     The OISAIR Project pursues the final goal of establishing the Open Innovation System of the Adriatic-Ionian Region (OISAIR), a single competitive and attractive marketplace for technology and innovation at macro-regional level. OISAIR intends to strengthen the development of industrial and entrepreneurial activities within a virtuous circle involving relevant stakeholders, from research institutions to SMEs and public administration in the Adriatic-Ionian Region. Coordinated by Area Science Park (Italy), the OISAIR project is co-funded by the Interreg ADRION Programme and is developed in collaboration with 6 partners based in the Adrion Region: University of Basilicata; HR \u2013 National Chamber of Economy; RS \u2013 Belgrade Technology Park; SI \u2013 Ljubljana Technology Park; AL \u2013 Ministry of Finance and Economy; GR \u2013 Centre for Research & Technology Hellas.     Joint R2B Innovation vouchers (experiments) under OISAIR will transform early stage technologies (between TRL 3 and 6) and patents deriving from universities and research institutes into commercial applications and products for the market through the co-development of prototypes\/testing with established SMEs.     Experimental plan description:     The main objective of the experiment is to develop an innovative solution according to Industry 4.0 requirements for increasing the energy efficiency in injection molding process and thus optimization of energy and material consumption inside the injection molding production cycle, when producing complex metal-plastic parts. After reviewing existing solutions in the tool-and-plastic market, we can confirm that there is currently no such solution available that would specially focus also on metal inserts since majority of solutions is focused strictly on the mold and injection molding machine side.     The heat increase that is introduced inside the mold once the correctly heated metal insert based on artificial intelligent (AI) algorithms and temperature measurements with IR camera is inserted inside the mold would allow for smart balancing of temperature field inside the mold, and also lower electrical energy and material consumption. Lower electrical energy consumption would be reached by special AI algorithms that would constantly control the temperature of metal inserts and mold. Lower material consumption would be reached by optimized process parameters in real time that are constantly monitored using the appropriate communication protocols that would help also to increase the overall effectiveness of production (OEE).

Joint R2B Innovation experiments under OISAIR: Scientific Partner: TECOS Business Partner: FLEXIDO     Sample Project     The client had to renew a wore down rotor with knife segments for which they didn't have any documentation. With precise 3D scanning of the original and creation of functional CAD model we provided them with data for production of replacement.     The customer has presumed problems with excessive warpage in the stage of tool design. The material is PA66 with 30% of glass fibers. With the help of advanced injection moulding analysis we predicted the trend and values of warpage and thus successfully eliminated the problems.     Our client has planned a single phase deep drawing process for the presented case, however several doubts about manufacturability arose. The conducted analysis has cleared all doubts.     We made a comparative study between experimentaly and numerically determined strength of a fibre reinforced product, which yielded extremely good match of the results from both methods. "

Computer science has found its way to practically all areas of contemporary life. Students benefit from several online resources like chat, video conferencing, email, social media and internet bulletin boards.     As most applications don\u2019t take a scholarship resume, adding one is a superb way for students to acquire an edge. The theoretical part of the computer science curriculum helps to ensure that students have the formal tools to stay current as technologies change. Moreover, there are lots of free resources offered for studying computer science.     Wgu Computer Science Reddit \u2013 What Is It?     If you\u2019re nursing assignment help thinking about pursuing a computer science career, or merely curious, here\u2019s a list of 50 of the top-paying work in the area. Because of this, job growth won\u2019t be as fast as during the previous decade, as jobs that would have gone to computer computer software engineers in the USA would instead go to computer computer software engineers in nations such as India. In general, Umali says studying computer science can result in cool jobs in a variety of industries.     On-line nursing programs are somewhat more plentiful than many different degrees as it is so convenient to educate aspiring nurses via distance education. Open courseware may also function as a refresher for college graduates that are hoping to bone up on a specific subject that is related to their career. These courses can result in a number of the fastest growing jobs through 2014, as stated by the Labor Statistics Bureau.     However, this doesn\u2019t indicate that trained nurses from other nations don\u2019t get hired. There\u2019s no dearth of colleges in India that provide engineering courses in a variety of streams. If you\u2019re self-employed https:\/\/guides.library.ucsc.edu\/c.php?g=119795&p=781322 you will need to arrange your own training but most employers will offer on-going training whilst working.     Needless to say, if you\u2019re juggling work together with your college degree program, it\u2019s almost always a positive feature for employers. The degree is usually completed in four decades, or five years in the event the co-op option is chosen. Inside my experience, it turned out to be a overall degree.     Wgu Computer Science Reddit \u2013 What Is It?     A Master in Computer Science is a significant alternative. Computer science examines the theoretical elements of computers. Distance-learning If you\u2019ve decided to make a graduate degree in computer science but cannot commute or relocate, you could consider an on-line level.     Students may earn their degree in no more than one year. They must complete the total subjects in order to qualify for the program. Depending on the exam requirements, they may need to schedule multiple weeks or months in advance.     Our writers know of the demands of all Computer science papers. The 2 tracks will usually incorporate some common courses, but a distinct general architecture. As with the majority of engineering disciplines, acquiring a sound understanding of mathematics and science is essential for computer engineers.     Each track has a distinct set of requirements through the overall structure stays the same. Steve (obviously, his name was changed) had to compose some of his tests in an internet system. Any sort of this work is an arduous job to write.     With a major in CIS you will likewise be able to manage information systems and networks in a organization.

All to make this chain even stronger than before. We won\u2019t tell this like a travelogue, about weather and the beautiful scenery you can\u2019t find words for anyway. Not even about the flora and fauna. I love to hear stores of individuals, who accompanied me on this journey. I begin to see that the participating members of the march up to Kredarica and all the way to Triglav are not coincidental; they are a part of their own life\u2019s story. I begin to see and admire values that I didn\u2019t seem to detect during our business meetings. And with each step my admiration grew. And when I reach the final chapter, I talk to the next person. A new person, a new life story to tell, the story which lead him\/her to this steep slope beneath the mountains. At steeper ends of the march, the words tend to get fewer and in my mind I then began to think about my own life story. Why am I here? Why I am in the midst of this team of hikers, which trusted and agreed to spend one day in their life with me? Do I really deserve this trust? Which person do I really have to thank for this? At this question, I start to think back about my pretty screensaver at home. About the first real telephone call, which invited me and allowed me to step into their embrace. Then \u2013 either you are, or you aren\u2019t. And I was. And happy and thankful too, for this life changing call I received. I think further ahead of this, through my friend circle I have, which helped me discover new paths in life, making jumps on other sides of the river and seeing and experiencing things I would have never imagined. Things, that later, turn out to be the best stories you can tell others at cozy campfires in the winter. Upon looking at our team\u2019s joy then they first saw the sunrise on the top of Triglav, a heavy weight was lifted off my shoulders. Not a heavy weight really, more like the weight of the whole world. With the effort and help of the whole team we made it. The trust I really did deserve, and I get a new chance. A chance to step into new chapters in our lives together. The end therefore turns into another chapter, a part filled with emotions, my personal favorite. Life runs by fast, so there is no reason for blank chapters in your life story. Onward we go, to write many more new stories.

        "text":" Motivation     When it comes to timber as sustainable and renewable construction material, it is usually equivalent to softwood, namely spruce. Hardwoods almost never appear in this context. This is despite the fact that significant amounts of hardwoods are already or will be available, e.g. in France, Germany or Austria due to the ongoing transformation of large areas of forests. It may be assumed that stronger utilization of hardwoods will result in two positive effects: better timber availability on the whole for the wood processing industry and the support of the European forestry strategy to increase the amount of hardwood as targeted in the European and national forest policies. So far, hardwoods have seldom been used for timber structures due to versatile technical challenges, mainly specific species properties, which influence the whole building product chain. It is vital to create the required value added hardwood products to enable the economic and innovative application of hardwoods in the building sector. EU Hardwoods aims at delivering answers to recent questions for the various (production) processes which need to be considered. Appropriate processing will clearly differ from the processing of softwoods. The highest potential in the usage of hardwoods lies most commonly in glued timber products, e.g. glulam (homogenous = all lamellas are of the same species and have the same strength class as well as inhomogeneous = all lamellas are of the same species but have different strength classes) or cross laminated timber. Also hybrid products are in consideration, in which the main part consists of softwood supported by hardwood components utilizing their species dependant characteristics in an optimal way and thereby bolstering the performance of the product. Last but not least, some European hardwood species, e.g. oak, chestnut or black locust, exhibit natural resistances against weathering effects or biological attack comparable to tropical hardwoods. Thus, increased use of these wood species will substitute tropical hardwoods and protect these endangered ecosystems.     State of the art in hardwood application in the building sector     The approach of more extensive use of hardwoods in the building sector started only a few years ago, but the application still requires further development as innovative products are still rare. A small number of projects aiming at product development, technical approval and investigations towards standardisation have been performed so far, building the basis for the proposed project approach. These projects tackled the problems of appropriate strength classification and grading systems for the sawn hardwoods and their further manufacturing to construction components:     a) Hardwoods for construction purposes can be visually graded using national grading rules. EN 1912 allocates national (visual) grades to the European strength class system for hardwoods, i.e. so called \"D\" classes. Besides tropical hardwoods, beech, ash or oak from Germany as well as chestnut from Italy are allocated to strength classes as high as D40. For all other hardwood species and origins this strength classification system cannot be applied due to missing data or allocation.     b) Besides visual grading, the application of machine strength grading would be another option to allocate hardwood species to a specific strength class. However, so far no machine strength grading for hardwoods has been established, not even for glulam lamellas.     c) Only recently some technical approvals have been issued on a national basis regulating the production and design value of some glued hardwood products: Z-9.1-704 (DIBt) Glulam made of oak, Company Gamiz, Spain Z-9.1-821 (DIBt) Glulam made of oak, Company Schiller, Germany Z-9.1-679 (DIBt) Glulam made of beech or hybrid glulam combining beech and softwood, German association of producers of glued laminated timber products, Germany     d) Recently, first national approvals for adhesives have been issued on a national basis providing the evidence to be used for hardwood components, e.g. Z-9.1-807 (DIBt).     e) The former harmonized standard for glulam production EN 14080:2005 offers the possibility to produce CE-marked glulam made of hardwoods by testing of lamellas, finger-joints and whole glulam beams. However, this legal basis for hardwood products expired with EN 14080:2013 \u201cTimber Constructions \u2013 Laminated Timber Requirements\u201d, voted positively in EU formal vote just recently. At the moment, efforts concerning a CUAP (\u201cCommon Understanding of Assessment Procedure\u201d) related to glued hardwoods products are made.     f) In some European countries research related to the use of hardwoods in the building sector has been performed, e.g. allocation of hardwood lamellas to European strength class system, gluing of hardwoods as well as loading capacity of these building construction elements. It has been focused on the main hardwood species, i.e. oak, beech and chestnut, accompanied by some smaller projects on ash or poplar. However, important knowledge gaps in production and characterisation of performance of hardwood glulam still exist, with the consequence that glulam made from hardwood may be manufactured and traded, but still no general admission in building regulations has been achieved such as glulam from softwood, and no discernible increase in the use of hardwoods has been reached so far. An equivalent status is reached for cross laminated timber.     Aims of this project proposal     Previous experience indicates that possible utilisations of hardwoods are engineered products. The use of solid hardwood products is atypical mainly because production to date is too expensive. Therefore, in the future the predominantly manufactured building products made of hardwoods will be hybrid glulam or hybrid cross laminated timber (CLT) consisting of lamellas with smaller cross-sections than solid wood products. To fill the gaps of knowledge and technological developments for a broad application of hardwoods in the construction sector, the following tasks have been identified. This research proposal focuses on beech, oak, ash and Sweet chestnut with the following aspects:     i) Definition of the raw material with respect to availability and log quality. The aim is to define the potential for different roundwood qualities and grades including sawing potential \/ patterns.     ii) Compiling existing and\/or new data to enhance the characterisation of the hardwood species of interest with respect to mechanical properties (strength, modulus of elasticity, density) to complement the database for a grading classification system (visual and machine strength grading) as grading is the pre-requisite to widen the range of applications.     iii) Pre-normative testing and assessment aiming at certification of adhesives for the use with hardwoods.     iv) Development of solutions for the most important building products, respective components and dimensions for: a) finger-joints in solid timber and finger-joints in lamellas, b) homogeneous and inhomogeneous as well as hybrid glulam, c) usage of hardwood glulam in service class 3 for weather exposed outdoor use and cladding.     v) Development of new high-tech products: cross laminated timber as a combination of hardwood and softwood lamellas. E.g. hardwood lamellas from beech can be placed in the inner zone to increase the (rolling) shear capacity in this zone which is often responsible for low strength values of the whole plate. This fact enables the usage of a broad variety of strength grades of hardwoods in high quantity.     vi) Optimisation of the production processes of homogeneous and inhomogeneous glulam and cross laminated timber made from hardwoods on the basis of the results of i) to v) in terms of sawing and gluing.     vii) Derivation of strength models for glulam and cross laminated timber on the basis of strength properties of lamellas and finger-joints, validation through testing (see ii and iii). The main aim is to transfer and complete the knowledge along the whole production line of hardwoods to broaden the use of hardwoods in an efficient and economic way in practice. "

We are introducing an innovative development model for generating various forms of sustainable development, taking into account the vital energy properties of the physical space and in cooperation with different professions in a spirit of environmental and social responsibility.     We are proceeding from a new paradigm: the physical environment is a living organism, meaning that we can work with the landscape as an intelligent and sentient being. The basic guidelines for development in the landscape or in a company can be discerned in the energy underpinning the environment and in the consciousness of the space - the genius loci - which ancient cultures recognised. In Slovenia, testament of this was preserved right up until the middle of the previous century.     After an introduction to geomancy and collaboration with Marko Poga\u010dnik in the middle of the 90s, we developed our own approach.     This approach to designing sustainable development that includes the vital energy potential of the physical space was developed through experience with geomantic planning of settlements, and individual constructions (Projekt 8 Dom\u017eale neighbourhood, Planina hamlet, settlement of Visoko pri Ajdov\u0161\u010dini, Vid Nova Gorica private medical centre, Costella water bottler, Fara; \u010ce\u0161minov Park in Dom\u017eale), and geomantic guidance for business and introducing the integrated treatment of companies (TA-BU nepremi\u010dnine (real estate) d.o.o. Ljubljana, Cestno podjetje Koper (road company), In\u0161titut za delni\u010darstvo (shareholding) Ljubljana, Fla\u0161ka d.d. Begunje, Endovital Ko\u010devje, Vita center d.o.o. Naklo and more).     Robi Lavin received a special award from the Slovenian Chamber of Commerce in 2010 for innovation in business consulting.     Karin Lavin extends her creative approaches from art into various forms of public activity within the modern art genre of land-art (education and awareness-raising about the importance of heritage and its integration into development). In this way she expands the field of art to the area of consciousness, both individual and collective. The projects yield results ranging from new methods of teaching through heritage to labyrinths and graphic and industrial design, which incorporates the energy function of forms.     In the Upper Kolpa Valley we worked creatively with the Municipality of Kostel in its efforts towards sustainable development and creating green jobs in the sparsely populated, unspoilt nature of the valley. We collaborated in designing the brand Svet Kolpe (World of the Kolpa). In converting the old school into a Tourism Development and Information Centre, after studying the location we drew up a plan to arrange it with lithopunctures and decorative paintings that reflect the archetypes of the physical environment. We provided an energy enhancement for a water pump and designed a water bottle applying the principles of holistic design, and its design in this way reflects the energy quality of the water.     Modern geomancy continues the tradition of old cultures whose traces are recognisable in Slovenia and Europe. At the same time they coincide with the findings of modern cognitive knowledge.     Development planning using a holistic approach is vital to the development of local communities (municipalities, local communities) and regions. By incorporating the vital elements of the landscape we ensure the health of the physical space and consequently of the inhabitants. Our proposals have been incorporated into the Regional Development Plans 2014 - 2020 in four Slovenian regions.     On the municipal level the municipal spatial plans are those that provide a basis for healthy development. We made a detailed analysis of the area earmarked for expanded settlement for the municipality of Dom\u017eale. The analysis discusses individual locations in the wider area and demarcates zones that are unsuited for building, along with the deeper qualities of the space, with guidelines for urban planners and architects regarding how to include them optimally in planning, so as to avoid any damage to the vital energy and spiritual potential of the location, and with pointers as to how we might enhance the quality of the given features. Dom\u017eale was the first municipality in Slovenia to include an energy study of a location envisaged for settlement expansion in municipal spatial planning documents.     Education is of truly special importance for developing an integrated approach to the environment. We organise education with the aim of generating integrated development in various areas and through various activities: from schools and nursery schools to local communities, societies and other groups.     A special set of education sessions for educators - teaching through heritage - is being provided in various locations around Slovenia: a multi-year collaboration with the Slovenska Bistrica and Nova Gorica nursery schools, and as part of various projects in Dom\u017eale, Gorenjska - the Forest and Countryside project - open learning environment for young people, the international project Living Landscape at the University of Primorska and more.     We work with various creative people and experts in different fields: architects and urban planners (Aleksander Ostan, Ira Zorko, Adrijan Cingerle), scientists and innovators (Andrej Detela, Maks Vre\u010dko, Anton Fabjan).     The project KRRES Geomancy - platform for sustainable development of Rifnik and its archaeological site, \u0160entjur, Kalobje and Resevna     Through in-depth research of the location, in which we discerned the subtle spiritual and energy dimensions of the environment, we gained an insight into both the characteristics of its existing ancient patterns, and the principles for the most appropriate development of the wider area and individual microlocations, farms and local companies.     The inclusion of local people and entrepreneurial guidance in developing activities and in designing a common local brand served to express the identity of the landscape and the established programme of green tourism.     The KRRES Geomancy project, with its added value of spiritual and energy dimensions, goes beyond the established norms. It involves an integrated and innovative approach to spatial and social development. The use of intuitive knowledge, which is woven into the working methodology of the project, provides a multifaceted contribution to the wellbeing of the environment and people. It introduces a new hologram model of development that signals co-existence, co-living, an expression of deeper potentials of individuals and the landscape and thereby an enhancement and upgrading \/ enriching into diversity. This heralds a modern-day solution for various environments elsewhere in Slovenia and the world.     In the future we will develop activities in various projects from green tourism to pilgrimages with trained guides, who will offer visitors a deeper experience of the landscape, cultural monuments, nature and themselves.     Through education we wish to bring people closer to a new concept of success, based on personal development and the fulfilment of deepest desires or a personal calling, and contribute to diversity and concern for the community.     As in Sol\u010davsko, we are striving to revive the wisdom of heritage and to design new models of coexistence and respectful collaboration with the environment.     The development of activities, be it for the individual, company or landscape, derives from deeper potentials, from the spirit core.     We therefore wish in future to develop various forms of green tourism, to cooperate in various environments in new forms of social organisation and to promote a new model of success, based on deeper potentials of the individual and on the expression of the individual's unique qualities, the expression of the deeper potentials of the landscape, social responsibility and concern for the community.     Heritage through perception, discovery and creativity - Karin Lavin     The human capacity for perception is much greater than that which we are accustomed to using. A number of abilities lie latent within us: we do not use them and we frequently do not even discover them. Using exercises which are often designed as games, we can awaken these capabilities, become aware of them, and develop them. Intuitive thinking is as important a tool of judgment as rational thinking.     The subtle experience of nature enables us to connect with a multi-dimensional space, with the intelligence of nature. Some years ago studies using a lie detector showed that plants in some way perceive our intentions. Nature is much more than a collection of biological organisms.     The vital energy of space was recognized by our ancestors. They knew how to build and shape space in such a way that they did not damage its vital sources of energy.     The landscape with its boulders and rocks had for them a different meaning compared to what it has for us today. They perceived manifold expressions of life in their environment. Thus life was given to them not only from the crop fields but also - looking at it from a modern perspective - from the ostensibly insignificant rocks beside them. They recognized particular roles and laws contained within the shapes of nature which in harmony with the whole gave vitality to the environment.     The understanding and recognition of these messages of nature often spilled over into stories, the symbolic language of legends and folk tales, whose deeper message can be understood only when we learn their archetypal language.     The creative potential of the individual means a constant source of inspiration and changes. Through artistic expression we stimulate our creative thinking. In artistic expression we come to know our personal uniqueness and the symbolic language of images. The modern way of life directs us primarily toward rational thinking, which is usually not balanced by giving equal value to the intuitive, feeling part of us. And it is the language of images that is the language of intuition. Images which are expressed in art work can bring us a rich message about ourselves and the way we experience the environment.     Creative teaching using heritage and connection with nature     Objectives     On this course participants will learn how to use heritage as a means for teaching and learning about the world.     The work takes place mainly outdoors, in natural settings and on visits to cultural sites.     The course treats the person and the environment in a holistic way.     It is intended for schoolteachers, preschool teachers, and other mentors.     It includes heritage in compulsory teaching content and other forms of mentoring work with young people and adults.     It will take into account the potential of the individual and encourage creative thinking.     It will bring together various fields of knowledge and capabilities and create\/design new approaches to the treatment of heritage of different kinds.     THEMES:     Development of creative methods of teaching using heritage     - Perception, research and creating using heritage     - Understanding people and space in a holistic way     - Land-art - activities in the landscape and awareness     Recognition, expression, and development of the potential of the individual     - Creative potential - commitment to the realization of the talents and interests of the individual     - Creative process: feeling \u00c3 idea \u00c3 action \u00c3 result     - Artistic expression as a stimulus for creativity     - Archetypes - symbolic language of images     - Hidden potential of the individual: the development of inner senses and intuitions as capacities for deeper perception     - How to cultivate curiosity - the basis for learning and creativity     - Inclusion in social life (institution, company), a model for connection     The program of sensibilization of the subtle dimensions of nature and of a creative approach towards heritage = learning through heritage and the holistic experience of people and space develops a sensitive attitude towards the environment. A sensibilized person functions as a co-worker of nature who through his activity builds on natural properties.     The course includes trips, excursions, and tours of cultural monuments, in the course of which exercises for deepening the appreciation of heritage and creativity will be conducted. By the conclusion of the course participants will have developed their own approaches towards the treatment of a theme from heritage which they choose themselves.     - Sensibilization exercises     - Development of individual methods of work using heritage     - Cultural visits, excursions     Following up     As a follow-up each participant will be asked to lead an exercise in his home environment with a group (of children, pupils, adults, museum visitors, etc.) and document it (a brief description, three photographs) and send the material to the organizer by mail. The program leader is available to all participants for any further explanations or guidelines after the conclusion of the course (by mail).     The exercises conducted will be published on the website of the organizer.     PRESENTAZIONE DELL'APPROCCIO SOSTENIBILE DELLA GEOMANZIA     Per conseguire soluzioni innovative di progettazione, relative alla conservazione e al miglioramenton della qualita dell'ambiente e della sua identita, usiamo l'approccio sistemico sostenibile.     In base al riconoscimento dell'innovazione ricevuto nel 2010 dalla Camera di Commercio e Industria di Lubiana, abbiamo perfezionato la nostra conoscenza attraverso la realizzazione di progetti di ricerca scientifico - geomantica, di pianificazione territoriale, di consulenze sull'energia, di formazione e di ecologia sistemica dell'ambiente, dove trattiamo l'ambiente nella sua interezza, ossia non solo le singole parti della natura. In base alle soluzioni conseguite abbiamo creato un modello di lavoro trasferibile, utilizzabile per la realizzazione di un'autentica progettazione sostenibile. Per implementare la valorizzazione, la tutela e lo sviluppo dei beni culturali e naturali includiamo nello sviluppo sostenibile il potenziale energetico-vitale del paesaggio, cosi come nuovi contenuti culturali e storici. Cio garantisce la salute del paesaggio e offre le condizioni di un'esperienza esauriente delle\/i visitatrici\/ori. Con il turismo verde sensibilizziamo le visitatrici\/ori riguardo l'importanza della conservazione dei beni culturali e dell'identificazione delle loro origini. Questa e una nuova tendenza nel turismo, che trasforma un turismo stagionale e superficiale in un turismo esauriente e continuativo con contenuti legati alla natura e alla cultura.     La scienza ambientale ecosistemica (Ecosystem Environmental Science) della geomanzia e una metodologia di ricerca basata sulla concezione sistemica dell'ambiente, dell'ecologia, del patrimonio immateriale, della geobiologia, della geografia dell'energia. Le conoscenze relative alla tutela della natura sono versatili. Tale scienza contiene un nuovo paradigma di sviluppo ambientale, e identica agli imperativi del cambiamento globale ed e stata testata su progetti realizzati nel settore del turismo verde, dell'urbanistica, dell'architettura, dell'ecologia, della geobiologia, del patrimonio, nel mondo degli affari e nei progetti innovativi riguardanti la salute del territorio.     MISSIONE     La nostra missione e introdurre un modello innovativo di sviluppo verde per uno sviluppo sostenibile. Si fonda sulla Piattaforma geomantica della ricerca ambientale dell'interezza.

        "text":" Red Pitaya tutorial     PING PONG game     Summary     This tutorial is an upgrade of the first lesson \u201cDisplay picture with VGA\u201d, where the basics about how to start working with Red Pitaya are covered. It is a step by step guide on how to make a simple game on Red Pitaya board. I choose the PING PONG game, but with little modification, it can be changed to something else. Game is designed for two players. Score is displayed on the top of the screen. The player that reaches 11 points first, wins the game and the score bar is cleared. Different colors, ball speed and size, and size of the tables can be easily set, so the players can modify game appearance and difficulty according to their wishes.     Required software     Xilinx vivado     SDK I used the latest version 2017.4, but older versions should also be fine. Software can be installed from official Xilinx website for free.     Required hardware     Step by step tutorial     Synchronizes monitor (VGA)     Draw tables (rackets)     Draw ball     VGA IP sends the coordinates to PP_ball, Table and Table IP. Each of those three generates their part of the picture. PP_ball is the first in the row, and it draws the ball and score bar. Two Table IPs add the first and the second racket. They are in a series connection, and the last component sends the united RGB signal to the screen. Btn_RE IP is there for capturing the signals from the buttons and rotary encoder from the extern board.     Creating AXI peripheral block     To connect SDK application and hardware designed in Vivado there needs to be some registers reserved through which the data can be send and received from. There are two ways to do this. The first one is general purpose interface, AXI_GPIO. Two disadvantages of this solution are, that it uses a lot of resources, and that it only has two ports. Although it is a fast and simple solution, I would need to use a lot of them to communicate with all my ports. The second way is packing our code as AXI peripheral, where we can decide how many register we are going to use. Adresses can be seen in address editor above block diagram. The first address is written and others are shifted by 4, because 32 bits width data bus are used.     To make the AXI peripheral IP, write you code in vhdl, then select AXI peripheral when you want to package your IP.     Axi peripheral has two components. The first component is the one where registers are defined, the second one contains our code. To access our component, I included my code in the project and connected components with port map. Data bus width is set to 32 bit, but because not all bits are needed, I had to match the signal vector length with the number of bits that I am reading from the registers.     Draw Table component     This component has 3 inputs for tracking current cursor position on the screen, which are also visible on the block diagram. Additional 5 inputs, that aren\u2019t directly seen on the block diagram are connected to the registers. These are registers for communicating with SDK application. As I already mentioned each of the registers has its unique address and has to be initialized in the SDK.     Hardware inputs:     hst, vst and rgb - ports for monitor     rgbPrev - tells us what was is the output of the previous component. I connected the components in series, and don\u2019t want to overwrite the output with next component in series.     Software inputs:     data_position - position in the array     offset - moving picture on the screen     size - how much array we are using     background - which color is in the background, where we don\u2019t draw our picture     First I created an array, for saving my data. I choose array dimensions 16 * 256, with 3 bits for color data, so 8 different colors can be set.     Array mustn\u2019t be read from and written to at the same time, so I set the flag, to enable writing in it.     Below is the code that enables reading from the array. We have to remember that our array is smaller then the screen size, so we have to calculate, when our cursor is in the right position. I set picture start position (XOff, YOff), and the picture size (Hp_Size, Vp_Size).     Here is the picture of our region     Last thing that needs to be taken care of is sending data to the rgb output. I devided the whole region into 3 subregions:     outside the screen     inside the screen, but outside of the picture region     inside the picture region     According to this regions, I set different values on rgb data bus.     I have components connected in series, and I check if anything is already written on current point. If current component doesn\u2019t contain any new data, the previous data has higher priority than background, and previous data is send out. If nothing was written there I set the RGB signal to background.     Draw ball component     This component is similar to the previous one. Here rgb is set for the first time and that is why there isn\u2019t rgbPrev signal included. For score keeping I made separate array in the ball component. 3 bits of the 32 bits width are used for the background, the rest are unused. I added 3 more bits for the score bar color data, 11 bits to shift position on X axis as players gain points (Y axis is constant), and another bit for enabling writing in the array.     This could all be done in one component, but I decided to break the problem into smaller pieces for simplicity. Even if only one component is used, there would still have to be different arrays for every figure, because external RAM of the Red Pitaya can\u2019t be used, and there isn\u2019t enough memory on FPGA board to make the array as big as is needed.     Read buttons     On extension board there are 4 buttons and 1 rotary encoder. Their states are saved in the CLPD PISO register, and are later send one by one to Red Pitaya.     As is can be seen on the block diagram out IP interface has 3 output pins:     sck - 50 kHz clock for shifting data in shift register     load - data is uploaded in shift register     t - output that is then send to AXI_GPIO and used in SDK application.     clk50 - 50 MHz clock source     din - data from CPLD     Below is vhdl code that collects the data and sends it forward. Buttons are used for moving the rackets up and down the screen, while rotary encoder can be used to change game speed, ball or racket size. We need a process, where we gain information about the direction of rotation, and then the data can be manipulated in SDK environment. I used the rotary encoder for changing the size of the rackets.     The process where I read the buttons from the external board.     And another process below, for checking the direction of rotation of the rotary decoder.     Occupied resources     A picture below shows how many resources were used. You can find this information under Design runs below the block diagram.     SDK code     The game algorithm is all written in c programming language, and it is running separately from the FPGA part. I think the best way to explain the code is if I describe each function with a few sentences.     For easier ilustration of program execution below is a flow chart that shows how functions are called. Below is the picture how the games looks on the monitor.     Conclusion     In conclusion, this was my first project on Red Pitaya board. In the beggining I had quite a few problems, before everything was working the way I wanted, and even though I am quite happy with the result there are a few things that could be added and improved. Less resources could be used if all the arrays would be declared in one component and all the data bus width would be used. It depends what your goal is, less components spare the number of resources, but everything becomes more complicated to follow. Additional colors would also make aplication more interesting for different kinds of implementation. Another interesting thing would be to add bloks that display more graphic forms, for example different figures, text and graphs, that would really contribute to the application usefullness. "

Online map background with history storage + Android phones application for free lifetime     InStock     Price 247,00 \u20ac     HOW A GPS LOCATOR WORKS     The GPS locator is able to determine its position using a sensitive GPS module. The detected location can then be sent to you via SMS message or sent to a server, where you can monitor not only the current location, but also the complete history of movement.     In order for the locator to be able to communicate remotely, it is necessary to insert a SIM card with a charged credit (with an activated data plan if you want to use monitoring via a web server or smartphone application).     USE OF LOCATOR     Thanks to its very long endurance, the locator is suitable for use mainly for tracking passenger cars. However, its dimensions are not huge, so you can place it in a child's backpack, for example, to control the movement of your child. The locator is equipped with an SOS button that your child can press in case of a problem, and you will be informed immediately.     Consumption while moving     50mA     ENDURANCE UP TO 100 DAYS     The GPS locator is equipped with a high-capacity battery, thanks to which it will last up to 100 days in operation.     SENSITIVE GPS RECEIVER     Thanks to the sensitive GPS receiver, the locator is able to reliably determine the position with an accuracy of a few meters. At the same time, it is able to update its location a few seconds after waking up from sleep mode.     TRACKING VIA MOBILE APPLICATION     Tracking with a mobile application is simple and efficient. The application allows you to view the current location, as well as the history of movement in the selected interval. The application is compatible with Android.     SMS NOTIFICATION WHEN THE BATTERY IS LOW     You will be informed about the low battery status in time via an SMS message.     LOW CONSUMPTION DUE TO SHOCK SENSOR     If the locator does not detect movement for more than 5 minutes, it will automatically go into power saving mode, in which it consumes only 2mA. As soon as the car starts moving again, the shock sensor ensures that the locator wakes up again.     WARNING WHEN MOVING     This feature ensures that you are notified immediately when your vehicle starts moving.     GEO FENCE     Allows you to set allowed or prohibited sites where the locator may \/ may not occur. You will receive an SMS notification when entering or exiting the set zone.     REMOTE EAVESDROPPING     The GPS locator is equipped with a microphone, thanks to which it allows you to listen to its surroundings. Just call the SIM card number inside the locator from your mobile phone, and you can listen immediately. Of course, the locator does not ring and answers the call automatically.

These products have been engineered and tuned to create a perfect match for extraordinarily dynamic, realistic sound reproduction and a spatial sound impression. With Alpine X-Series subwoofers, you get the top of Alpine\u2019s subwoofer technology for massive and accurate bass output. These flagship subs have been engineered and tuned with highest precision and use highest grade materials.     Peak Power: 2700 Watts     RMS Power: 900 Watts     Frequency Response: 26 Hz - 200 Hz     Podatki o modelu     Introducing the ultimate subwoofer     The New X-Series subwoofers were developed from a sound philosophy we call Alpine ID \u2013 a focus on highly accurate components built for superior imaging. A triple stacked magnet surrounds an extended voice coil, which allows a very long excursion resulting in huge air movement. A specialized CRC pole with integrated cooling fins and an aluminum shorting cap reduce the lag of coil\u2019s alternating movement while also providing cooling within the motor. The cone structure is suspended by two spiders and our patented H.A.M.R. surround. The stability of the dual-spider along with the even unfolding of the multi-roll surround create incredibly linear cone travel, free of any unneeded movement that cause distortion.     Overview     Alpine ID Sound Quality     900W RMS, making it a perfect match for the X-Series X-A90M 900W mono amplifier     24mm linear Xmax (1 way), 48 mm peak to peak     Dual spiders for precision control over the large dynamic range     Dual shorting rings for strong motor control ensuring low THD and tight bass     Center pole radial heat sink which wicks heat away from the voice coil and transfers it outside the motor, for long term high output     The biggest HAMR surround yet, for linear cone movement throughout its large range of excursion     Light but rigid pulp\/mica cone which allows for highly accurate bass with great natural tone     Twist-lock Trim ring with full mesh grill included     Built to move tons of air     The 24mm X-max is best in class and allows close to 2 inches of full cone motion. In order to create a powerful yet accurate subwoofer, we had to implement several technologies that keep the cone under control. Dual spiders ensure a rigid moving assembly while the HAMR surround provides long linear travel. A shorting ring keeps the THD down while a custom heat sink integrated CRC pole and shorting cap keeps high magnetic force. These design aspects come together to produce incredibly precise, powerful bass.     All new motor design     The powerful and efficient motor coupled with its highly-controlled suspension give the X-Series subwoofer the ability to create loud and accurate bass in a very small, sealed box. Only requiring 28.3 l of air space (15.6 l for the 10\u201d), the 12\u201d X-Series subwoofer can reproduce frequencies down to 40 Hz before rolling off, leaving you with bass that digs deep and plenty of trunk space.     Easy grille and trim ring included     Taking design cues from tweeter development, we\u2019re incorporating a twist-lock trim ring which allows easy attachment of the included metal mesh grill. With a simple twist, the trim ring locks into place, concealing the mounting screws and locking the optional grille into place. The trim can be installed with or without the grille.     A perfect match     The X-Series amplifier X-A90M is the perfect amplifier for the job. Along with the 900W power matched specifications of both components, each were built under the same sound philosophy, Alpine ID. With a focus on musicality and sound imaging, the X-W12D4 \/ X-W10D4 is complimented by the amplifier's clean, low distortion output and >1500 damping factor. Add the X-Series speakers to the system and prepare to experience a new level of in-car imaging.

        "text":" Festivalito Rural 2012     Teachers     We are proud to have Melina Sed\u00f3 and Detlef Engel teaching at Festivalito Rural. Again. Here's some basic information about them, copied from their webpage:     Stylistically, they are at home in the traditional tango de sal\u00f3n, as it is danced in Buenos Aires, and which they interpret in a very personal and modern way. Their dance captivates through its intimate embrace, playful musicality and an almost puristic elegance: a sensual interplay of man and woman without clich\u00e9 or superficial effect. Thus, their tango is newly created in every single moment, and does not just express the music, but genuine feeling.     At the core of their lessons, which are always geared towards improvisational capability, are intensive body work and analysis of tango\u00b4s structures. But \u201etechnical\u201c understanding is just a means to concentrate better on the essential: developing one\u00b4s own style and relishing the embrace in unison with the music.     If you need proof that they are welcome in many places around the world, take a look at their references.     If you like to read, check out Melina's blog. In there, you'll find her opinion on almost anything... also on Festivalito Rural ;-)     Finally, if you're more of a visual type, here's a starting point for browsing YouTube: Detlef and Melina dancing to Tormenta of Carlos di Sarli at the Festival de Kerallic in France. Watching the video you will surely realise why a blog linking to this video calls them those masters of control ;-) "

        "text":" In order to prevent the spreading of Covid-19 and in accordance with recommendations from competent institutions, the Old Vine House is currently closed for visitors. You can still reach us via e-mail address stara-trta@maribor.si and phone number +386 51 335 521. We kindly invite you to visit our online wine shop and buy our products there. You can pick up your order in person by prior arrangement at the Old Vine House.     Indigenous grape varieties     Slovenia officially recognizes six indigenous grape varieties: ranina, klarnica, ranfol, Vitovska grganja, zelena and \u017dametovka, but we can add the seventh vine variety, Pinela.     Although in the past those were rather overshadowed by the world-famous varieties, smaller winemakers are now trying to revive them and put them on the world wine map.     The listed varieties must not be mixed with self-growing varieties such as jurka, \u0161marnica and others, nor with domesticated varieties, such as Malvasia or La\u0161ki Riesling, nor with varieties such as cvi\u010dek, jan\u017eevec, metli\u0161ka \u010drnina and many others.     Ranina     Austrian winemaker, Clotar Bouvier, in 1900, in the vineyards of Gornja Radgona discovered the white variety of ranina. It is projected that the variety is a cross between Pinot white and Green Silvaner. In Slovenian territory, ranina is the earliest variety. Its home is in Radgonske Gorice, where it is called simply special. It contains an extremely large amount of sugar and is suitable for special quality. It also produces an excellent must. The wine is rich, with a gentle acidity and rich with extract and alcohol. It has quite a unique bouquet and flavour.     Klarnica     Klarnica grows in the Vipava Valley. It was named after Mrs. Klara from Dornberk, because it is said that in the 16th century she planted it around her house as a protective boundary, so it is also called mejina (border). It is a vigorous variety that ripens late. In some places, they produce a sparkling wine from it.     Synonym: mejina     Colour: Golden yellow with greenish hues     Odour: fresh, grass (the Nokota flower)     Taste: The wine has a pleasant, rich body and, when in your mouth, it leaves your mouth with a long-lasting memory.     Ranfol     Ranfol\u2019s home is in Styria and was once quite the popular variety, though now it is almost extinct. Ranfol is not an aromatic variety, so winemakers use it in such genres as Halo\u017ean, though at the same time it has lively acids. In addition, it grows abundantly and ripens late.     Vitovska grganja     Vitovska grganija \u2013 this variety is found on the Italian and Slovenian Karst and is becoming very fashionable. It was first mentioned in 1844 by Matija Vrtovec, a known wine teacher and priest from Vipava. It is popular especially due to its relatively large cluster, a significant crop, unpretentious farming techniques and adaptation to agroecological conditions in Karst. In Karst, locals still use synonymous name 'Malvasia with the apostrophe'.     Synonym: Vitovska     Colour: strawish yellow     Aroma: fresh, fruity, slightly mineral     Taste: gentle because the wine is not rich in alcohol content, pleasantly sour     Zelen     Zelen is one of the most recognizable wines of the Vipava Valley (Vipavska dolina). As its name tells us (zelena is green in Slovenian), in addition to the green colour it boasts herbal notes and a well-rounded acid, though it was not named for those characteristics but for its characteristically light-coloured tendrils of its young vines. Matija Vertovec (1844) wrote about the prevalence of the Zelen variety in upper Vipava valley and listed Zelen among white noble varieties with a specific noble spirit.     Synonym: Vipava zelen     Colour: pale yellow with some noticeable green hues     Smell: apples, pears, rosemary     Taste: mature, spicy     \u017dametovka     This is one of the oldest domesticated noble wine varieties in Slovenia. It is most prevalent in the Posavje wine region, even in Podravska here and there. The oldest vine of \u017eametovka grown is in Lent, Maribor. The vine ripens late, bears many grapes and is highly resistant to pests. The variety is not picky of which soil it will root in, but is only picky about the position it will thrive in; it only thrives in a typical sunny position of a vineyard.     Pinela     It is a delicate variety for which DNA testing has not otherwise explicitly confirmed that it is indeed an indigenous Slovenian variety. After all, the morphological properties of Pinela belongs to the Western European geographical ecological group of varieties - Proles occidentalis, which means that considering the properties of a similar variety it has always been grown in Western Europe in contrast to the varieties that are grown in the east and by the Black Sea. In Slovenia, we can find it only in the wine-growing district of Vipava and sub district of Vrhe in the Karst wine-growing region, where it is grown as a recommended variety. In our area, it has been known since 1932. The variety gives a very full wine that can accompany complex dishes. "

There were 291 pupils in grades 1-8, and school lasted from Monday to Saturday. Works on school continued so the official opening was on 23rd of May 1959. The school was named Boris Kidri\u010d Primary School.     Throughout the following years the school continued to grow \u2013 extensions were built to provide space for a kindergarten, a library, a staff room, a dining room with a kitchen, a small and a big gym, a swimming pool, playgrounds, as well as some additional classrooms.     The school changed its name into Primary School Savsko naselje in the Autumn of 1997. Today, it is a medium-sized, state-owned school with approximately 360 pupils in grades 1-9, and a staff of 40.     School Facilities     Primary School Savsko naselje shares facilities with a private kindergarten, each working independently.     There is one administrative office, where parents can enquire about school-related things. To help our pupils study and develop to their best potential the school offers the following facilities and services:     Classrooms: Grades from 1-5 have their own classrooms \u2013 each classroom is equipped with its own PC and internet access. Grades 6-9 have a home classroom, but they change classrooms for individual subjects. Each classroom has a PC with internet access, and a projector. Research & reading: Our library and reading room maintains around 10,000 books. There are also computers with internet connection where pupils can research topics that interest them or that are related to school projects. Science, Information Technology, Craft Classrooms: The school has two Science classrooms, a Computer classroom, and a Crafts classroom. Computer facilities include a 30-workstation computer laboratory with internet connection. Three classrooms also have an interactive board. Dedicated classrooms: There are also dedicated classrooms for language learning (English\/German\/Slovene\/Spanish), Social Studies (Geography\/History), Music, and Art. Sport: Pupils can do sports in two gymnasiums, an indoor swimming pool, and an outdoor all-weather playing area. Kitchen: We provide breakfast, mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks; as well serving hot lunchtime meals. Breakfast and mid-afternoon snacks are only available to pupils from grades 1-5 who are part of the morning and\/or afternoon care. Extra-curricular activities: An interesting programme of extra-curricular activities is offered at the beginning of each school year. Activities take place in the afternoon. Most are available at no extra cost, and they run until the end of May. Special services: The school also houses an educational psychologist, two professors of special and rehabilitation pedagogy, and one qualified social pedagogue.     Staff     Here at Primary School Savsko naselje we have a dedicated staff who strive for excellence for all our pupils. All members of our staff, be it the cleaning ladies, the cooks, the caretakers, the secretary, or the teachers, make sure that they put maximum effort into their work to ensure the pupils\u2019 well-being.     We hope that when pupils leave our school, they are leaving as knowledgeable, confident, open-minded, reflective, and caring pupils who have high aspirations for their own future and who have fond memories of the time they have spent here at Primary School Savsko naselje.     Projects     In addition to following the basic curriculum, we also try to broaden our pupils\u2019 knowledge, minds, and horizons, which is why we are involved in various projects. Some of them are conducted on a school level, some on a city level, some on a state level, and some are international. Here are a few:     International Cooperation with pupils from Austria     eTwinning     Bike-Track-Bike     Every year we have a contest Create an Original Christmas Tree, in which pupils (and their parents) create Christmas trees from recycled materials of their choice. At the end of the competition we organise an auction at our Christmas bazaar; the money we raise goes into the school fund and is spent on providing school material for less-privileged pupils.     Thirty of the most diligent readers are invited to our Night of Stories at the Library. It is a night full of activities \u2013 from playing in the swimming pool, participating in workshops, eating pancakes, to reading stories late into the night. It definitely is a night they remember for a long time.     Pupils with a desire to perform are also able to try their hands at it. They can join the school choir, or if their forte is acting, they can take part in the school\u2019s theatre club. They usually perform at various school receptions and celebrations, as well as on cultural marathon day which we have at our school.     In the school year 2012\/2013 we also created our own project called Diversity enriches us. Pupils at our school come from different cultures and nationalities, and we wanted to include all of them in this project, thus showing everyone that we are all the same. The pupils learnt a dance, and then performed it in flashmob style in the city centre:     In addition to experiential learning, which children experience at Music, P.E., Art lessons and ecology, we have recently also been trying to become a model school for developing, testing and promoting Science and Craft. Our efforts have been focused on networking with Jozef Stefan Institute, educational establishments such as Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Academy of Fine Arts and Design as well as various companies, which could help us provide our pupils with as much experiential learning at a young age as possible.     Within the project we cooperate with eight partner schools in Ljubljana, to which we transfer our own knowledge and experiences as well as involve them in collaborative actions.     Our school was also chosen to organise a cultural performance in honour of Chinese New Year on 8th of February, 2016. Our pupils performed a play based on the book Ferdinand Avgu\u0161tin Hallerstein \u2013 A Slovenian in the Forbidden City by Huiqin Wang.     You can see the whole performance, including the opening speeches by Danijela Volj\u010d (member of the Board of Confucius Institute in Slovenia), Xie Duquan ( Chinese director of Confucius Institute), Maja Makovec Bren\u010di\u010d (Minister of Education, Science and Sport) as well as H.E. Ye Hao (Ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Slovenia), here: "

You can choose from a variety of screen colours and designs to best match your taste and vehicle.     7-inch Screen with 1 DIN chassis     More and more vehicles feature a dashboard space for a 7-inch or 8-inch screen, however behind the screen there is no space to fit a full 2DIN product. The new SMART is for example one of the the vehicles with such dashboard design. Alpine designed the INE-W720DC to overcome this problem by putting a 1DIN chassis in the back of a 7-inch screen.

The INE-W720DC includes an HDMI output as well to connect a rear monitor system via HDMI.

Note: X901 and X902 series systems are not compatible with park4night.     Set your vehicle\u2019s measurements     The big advantage of this navigation product is that you can input your vehicle\u2019s height, length, width, weight, and if you tow a trailer or not. These parameters are then considered when a route is calculated, to avoid results that are inappropriate for your specific vehicle.     Set your cargo parameters     The type of cargo you transport is equally important then a truck\u2019s measurements and weight: many areas have strict regulations when it comes to dangerous goods and can not be entered if a specific cargo type is loaded. This navigation unit allows you to input the type of cargo (such as explosives, flammable or non-flammable gas, poisonous substances, etc) to avoid that any route calculation includes restricted areas.     Online Navigation with Apple CarPlay     When you\u2019re driving, Maps helps you find the way to your destination with turn-by-turn spoken directions and new, easier-to-read visuals. When a turn is coming up, the view zooms in to show you exactly where to go.

The INE-W720DC works seamlessly with Android Auto and Google maps. Android Auto can even access the Alpine navigation antenna for highest positioning accuracy.     GPS and Glonass Compatible     More satellites equal higher navigation accuracy and a faster positioning fix. This Alpine product is compatible with GPS satellite signals and can also receive positioning data from Glonass satellites. This brings big advantages especially in an urban environment with many tall buildings and when driving next to high mountains. When using navigation with Apple CarPlay and Glonass you can also benefit from this new improved compatibility.     Built-in Bluetooth\u00ae Technology     The built-in Bluetooth\u00ae module allows wireless connection of a mobile phone for hands-free communication. A very intuitive user interface makes it very easy to set microphone and speaker volume. It also includes a speed dial function for the most frequently called numbers. Bluetooth\u00ae also enables audio streaming from the phone: audio content or even internet radio can be wirelessly transferred to your Alpine unit.     Vehicle Data-Bus Connectivity     If your car is equipped with parking sensors, you can continue to use this convenient function with your INE-W720DC.

Meeting point: Registration desk of IAU, Cankarjev dom     Ljubljana is one of the smaller European capitals, but we are convinced that many bigger cities can be envious of what Ljubljana has to offer. Its medieval city centre is squeezed between the castle hill and the Ljubljanica River. The river banks and many other important buildings were designed by renowned Slovenian architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik. Strolling through the city streets, one enjoys the pleasant view of the remnants of the Roman settlement Emona, the medieval old town, works by Ple\u010dnik, Baroque architecture and modern buildings specked with parks and squares.

        "text":" Simulation of job execution in managed distributed system     Abstract     Nowadays, the use of computers to solve complex computational problems is present virtually everywhere. There are more and more temporally and spatially complex problems. They are solved using purpose-built parallel systems. Most modern systems of this type fit almost exclusively into Flynn's MIMD category, examples of which are tightly coupled SMP systems, loosely coupled MPP systems, and clusters. Especially in the field of scientific computation, distributed systems have become established as an affordable substitute for parallel systems. They are suitable mainly for solving problems where the decomposition into subproblems is trivial. An important difference between the two approaches lies in its intended purpose. Parallel systems are designed to speed up problem solving (to enable a faster response time of the system), while distributed systems are mainly intended for environments where a high number of problems are solved (increased throughput of the system). A special type of distributed systems are voluntary systems that allow the exploitation of computing resources (processing and memory resources). The most famous and widespread systems are BOINC and Condor. The aim of both is the same, i.e. to exploit the computing resources during idle time. The BOINC system is used to exploit computing resources in a wide area environment, while the Condor system is suitable for closed environments. Both can be mutually complementary. The possibility of examining and evaluating the performance characteristics of such systems is crucial because it allows more efficient use of computing resources. Following the example of the BOINC and Condor systems and after simplifications were defined, a simulation model was designed in the form of an open queuing network with feedback. Simplifications were necessary since the simulation model would be otherwise difficult to manage. The queueing network consisted of a central queue and working queues. Working queues receive task from the central queue, carry them out and send the results back. The model verification confirmed the correctness of the operation, and the validation confirmed correct design. The implementation of the simulation model and of the simulation were carried out in the ns-2 discrete oriented open source simulation tool, which proved extremely versatile and flexible. The queue was designed with the help of two network nodes and their mutual network connection. The serving was realized by transferring the package via UDP network connections between nodes. Based on the designed model assumptions can be made about the behavior and performance of the real model. Any changes to the model parameters that were defined (such as queue capacity, number of queues, routing type, the probability of a feedback loop) can significantly affect its behaviour. The experiment results with the simulation model provided insight into the behavior of the model as its parameters were changed. For the input intensity, the Poisson process of UDP packets were used. It was found that as input intensity increases, so does the the model load, which means that the central server unit can quickly become a bottleneck. Its load further increases the greater the number of feeding units, and with the probability of returning UDP packets to the central queue. In the case of sufficiently powerful central queue, the bottleneck may be caused by working queues. Random routing does not allow for a steady load of working queues, especially if these have different performance. In this case a rapid increase in tasks to be performed, and consequently model saturation, follows working queues with worse performance. Balance is achieved by using the \"shortest queue first\" principle in routing. Working queues in this case are almost the same length. The use of this method of routing and of working queues with different performance enables us to discover some surprising behaviour. Working queues with better performance are automatically inclined to receiving long UDP packets, while those with worse performance receive shorter UDP packets. This might mean that more efficient free computer resources tend to implement more complex tasks, while less powerful free computer resources focus on implementing less demanding ones. The designed model is not restricted to simulations of a voluntary system. It is useful in any system consisting of a central unit and a set of work units. The only requirement is that the central unit sends jobs or tasks to the work units, which communicate the results back to the central unit upon completion.

        "text":" Natural healing factors     Thermal water, fango and turf     At Terme Dobrna, we have three natural healing factors recognised by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia, namely thermal water, fango, and turf.     Thermal water     The ancient Celts and Romans already knew the warm spring water in Dobrna. In the year 1403, the water was used the first time for health purposes. Since the year 1542, the thermal water in Dobrna is known as an ideal means in treating gynaecological and urological illnesses, rheumatic, and illnesses similar to rheumatism, for healing diseases and motor system injuries.     The alkaline thermal water with a temperature at the source of around 35 to 36,5 \u00b0C, and contains adequate amounts of calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen carbonate is the main healing factor in the Dobrna spa. Due to the calcium ions the water contains, the Dobrna thermal water acts as anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergy with all chronic inflammation of the digestion and urinary organs. It as well accelerates the purging of water from the body. Indirectly it helps in discharging kidney stones and gallstones from the body.     FANGO     Fango is an organic peloid made from the volcanic rock bentonite and thermal water. Fango has thermal and mechanical effects: heated to 40-45\u00b0C, it accelerates metabolism, tissue healing and reparatory processes, and softens and reduces tissue growth and scars. It can be used in a mud wrap, or in a bath. Fango wraps and baths are recommended for pain in the joints, spine, back and muscles, and rheumatic disease.     It helps metabolism, promotes sweating and eliminates waste substances, thereby promoting body detoxification.     TURF     Turf is organic peloid consisting of the decayed remains of plants with low dosages of oestrogens. Turf has thermal, chemical and mechanical effects. Mixed with water and heated to 40-45\u00b0C, it accelerates healing processes in the body and improves metabolism. As with fango, turf reduces and softens tissue growth and scars.     Turf baths promote the described body functions and strengthen its defence abilities, mitigating reduced joint flexibility, and rheumatic and degenerative pain.

June 2021     The film is an Italian-Slovenian-French co-production, with Mitja Li\u010den as the Slovenian director of photography.     Yesterday, Cannes unveiled the Critics\u2019 Week programme, which includes the Slovenian minority co-production Small Body, the debut feature of the Italian director Laura Samani that has qualified for the competition programme of seven selected films. On this occasion, the director stated the following: \u201cIf things do not have a name, they do not exist. Agata defies the established order of her time. She is a heroine who challenges the laws of society in the name of an unwritten law that is far more mysterious and unfathomable: absolute love. Her immense desire is to give her daughter a name so that she can let go of her once they become two separate beings. Agata\u2019s journey to the shrine is a gradual descent into the underworld, a path that leads her to the surprising discovery that there is a thin, unfathomable line between life and death, between reality and magic.\u201d     The film that is about to have its world premiere is an Italian-Slovenian-French co-production, with Mitja Li\u010den as the Slovenian director of photography. Mitja Li\u010den has received several awards for his previous work, including three Vesna Awards: for his features History of Love (2018) and The Tree (2014), directed by Sonja Prosenc, and the short film Paradise (2019), which he also co-directed with Sonja Prosenc.     The film was created with the participation of a number of Slovenian filmmakers, including a Slovenian technical team consisting of fourteen members. Furthermore, during the development stage of the project, the technical post-production of the photography, pre-production, and sound post-production were partly carried out in Slovenia. The Slovenian co-producer of the film is Danijel Ho\u010devar from the Vertigo production house, with Zala Opara as his assistant, while Matija Kozamernik is the production manager.     Italy, 1900. The young Agata gives birth to a stillborn child, who is therefore condemned to spend eternity in Limbo. Agata hears of a place in the mountains where infants can be brought back to life for just one breath and baptised so that their souls can be saved. She heads out on a journey with her daughter\u2019s tiny corpse hidden in a box and meets Lynx (Lince), a solitary boy who offers to help her. Together, they embark on an adventure that will bring them both closer to a miracle that seems entirely impossible.     Apart from the director, the screenplay was co-written by Marco Borromei and Elisa Dondi. Starring Celeste Cescutti as Agata and Ondina Quadri as Lince \/ Lynx. Also featuring Marco Geromin, Giacomina Dereani, Anna Pia Bernardis, Angelo Mattiussi, Luca Sera, Teresa Cappellari, Marzia Corinna Mainardis, Marisa Rupil, and the Slovenian actor Ivo Ban. Music by Fredrika Stahl, editing by Chiara Dainese, and sound by Luca Bertolin, Riccardo Spagnol, and Nathalie Vidal. Set design by Rachele Meliad\u00f2, costume design by Loredana Buscemi, and makeup design by Arianna Ferrazin.     The leading producer of the film is the Italian Nefertiti Film; the producers are Nadia Trevisan and Alberto Fasulo; while the French co-producer Thomas Lambert comes from the Tomsa-Films production company. The film was made with the financial support of the Slovenian Film Centre, the Friuli Venezia Giulia Audiovisual Fund, MIBACT, the international funds Eurimages and Creative Europe \u2013 MEDIA sub-programme, as well as Rai Cinema, CNC, ARTE\/Cofinova, Torino Film Lab Production Award, the Re-Act and When East Meets West development funds, and in collaboration with Viba Film Studio.     In 2018, at the development stage, the film received the prestigious Production Award at the Torino Film Lab and an award at the When East Meets West co-production meeting.     In the introduction, which presents the film selection, the following was written about the film Small Body: \u201cA breathtakingly beautiful film which proves that a great filmmaker was born.\u201d     The 60th-anniversary edition of the Critics\u2019 Week will take place from 7 to 15 July. The audience will have the opportunity to see thirteen features selected from among 1,000 films: seven in the competition programme and six at special screenings. Meanwhile, ten of the 1,620 short films that applied were chosen for the short film competition programme. Head here for more information on the entire Critics\u2019 Week programme.

A novel mobile preconcentration system, based on the use of multi-adsorbent sample tubes, has been developed for trapping relatively large-volume air samples in potentially remote areas. An Adsorption Desorption System-Gas Chromatography-Electron Capture Detector was used to measure the mixing ratios of the selected halocarbon species, while a Gas ChromatographyCombustionIsotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer was used to determine \u220213C values. For the species with strong local sources, the variation of isotope ratios has been observed over the experimental period. Some of the results reported in the present study differ from previously reported values and reasons for this are discussed. The reporting of different \u220213C values for selected halocarbons from different areas in the present study suggests that \u220213C values may be used to determine the relative magnitudes of anthropogenic and biogenic sources.

Time series and seasonal variations of the halocarbons were analysed over the period to determine biogenic and anthropogenic sources and sinks. Correlations between the target halocarbons were also observed, suggesting common sources within the area. Wind rose plots for all halocarbons have been used to assist in the determination of halocarbons sources. Halocarbon concentrations are highest at low\u2010wind speeds and decrease as wind speed increases, a few species (CCl4 and CH3Cl most notably) rise at very high\u2010wind speeds suggesting release from the Bristol Channel.

        "text":" Toma\u017e \u0160alamun     Toma\u017e \u0160alamun (photo: Kari Klemel\u00e4)     Toma\u017e \u0160alamun is considered to be one of the fathers of the Slovenian avant-garde and modernist poetry. In the 1970s, when he was a member of the avant-garde group OHO, at the Zagreb exhibition Great-great-grandfathers, he \u201cdrew a line\u201d and discovered art as a relationship between \u201ccan and cannot\u201d, and, at the same time, as a field spreading from the topos of art galleries to the world and human life as a whole. He received many national and international awards for poetry (Pre\u0161eren Prize, Jenko Award, the European Prize for Poetry from the city of M\u00fcnster, a Fulbright scholarship etc.) and is the most translated Slovenian poet. He taught creative writing at two American universities (University of Pittsburgh and University of Massachusetts Amherst, Richmond).     The relationship between \u201ccan and cannot\u201d can be seen in \u0160alamun\u2019s shifts in the Slovenian cultural and social space as follows: \u0160alamun rattled Slovenian poetry in its national and socio-political, internal and external borders, doing so in a manifestly leisurely and playful way; he brought into Slovenian poetry, which was fixated on the concealed crimes of the Second World War, American poetry as a way of seeking something continually new; he brought into his poetry marginal experiences and lifestyles which transgress the patriarcho-tribal tradition. With the principle \u201cI is language\u201d (which, in return, with different modes of speech sometimes shows and sometimes pretends that it has no self), and with lucid humour and various fresh creative concepts, his poetry became key and primary reading for young poets in Slovenia and the former Yugoslavia, regardless of whether they had killed their \u201cfather-idol\u201d or kept him alive.     It is difficult to separate \u0160alamun as a symbolic and almost mythological figure from his poetry. After his first volume of poems, Poker (1966), there came more than forty other volumes of poetry. In the final fifteen years of his life, this poetry moved increasingly into correlation with the pre-lingual and language, and further and further away from thoughts\/meaning and body, much like the way a laboratory instrument records fluctuations of the brain. Is there, in this recording, a necessity, a constant struggle and attempt for the cessation of this last, existential \u201cyou cannot\u201d? Can the field of possibilities continue indefinitely? Is it possible to reach into infinity with the help of language?     This website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.

The conference will take place virtually from 6 to 8 July 2021 and will cover six topics related to the health and the urban environment issues: urban health inequities, transforming built environments, urban governance and public health systems, urban health over the lifecourse, climate change and urban health, urban health in Latin America and the Caribbean.     On Tuesday, June 6, 2021 at 3:30 pm , Dr. Vita \u017dlender will present a poster entitled \u00bbDevelopment of evidence-based guidelines for designing green opens spaces to promote urban health through physical activity: Experience from Slovenia\u00ab. The authors of the poster and project member of the \u00bbVen za zdravje\u00ab project (Ina \u0160uklje Erjavec, Vita \u017dlender and Jana Kozamernik) participated in the preparation of the guidelines for the Ministry of Health in 2019.     Abstract: \u00bbPublicly accessible green open spaces such as parks, playgrounds and urban forests are key environments within urban tissue for promotion of physical activity and provision of many other public health benefits, including psychological relief and stress reduction, and the mitigation of various harmful factors such as excessive heat, noise, and air and water pollution. To expertly integrate spatial planning and public health topics, the Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia (UIRS) in 2017 launched the programme entitled \u00bbVen za zdravje\u00ab (Going out to stay healthy) \u2013 Expert basis for spatial planning of green areas, aimed at promoting physical activity of citizens. The programme was based on the preparation of a comprehensive overview of diverse aspects relating to planning, improvement, and management of green areas to achieve healthy and quality living environment. Its purpose was to stimulate more quality-of-life oriented planning and development of towns and settlements in Slovenia and develop expertise for providing spatial determinants for an active and healthy lifestyles for citizens of all ages and social groups. Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of current national legislation and documents related to public health, physical activity promotion and spatial planning. We also carried out workshops and discussions with relevant public health experts, decision makers and planners. The main outcome of the programme were guidelines for green space planning to support municipalities in devising relevant approaches and promote physical activity of the population. The proposed approach was tested on a pilot study in the municipality of Ko\u010devje in Slovenia.\u00ab     Smart Cities 2021 Conference - Activities of European Cities for Achieving Climate Neutrality     Thursday, June 3, 2021     Thursday, June 3, 2021 0 598     Smart Cities 2021 Conference - Activities of European Cities for Achieving Climate Neutrality     Abstracts of papers can be submitted by 21 June, conference scheduled for 16\u201317 September 2021 in Ljubljana     In cities, traffic remains one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions not to have been curbed in recent years. The development of carbon-neutral cities raises the question of which approaches can be used to ensure a turnaround with respect to such emissions so as to preserve or even improve residents\u2019 access to services in the future, thereby safeguarding their mobility. Changes in fuel consumption along with the development of information technologies in the planning, implementing, monitoring and communication with users hold the promise of playing an important role in this. Still, to achieve the ambitious goals concerning CO2 emissions and the broader impacts of traffic on the quality of urban living, these changes alone will not suffice. In the light of these goals and the newly-available technologies, cities will need to reconsider how their residents will live, work and access key services. To achieve this, balanced development will be required, together with the strong intertwining of spatial, traffic and digital accessibility.     ***     Send us your contributions for the scientific Smart Cities 2021 Conference: Activities of European Cities for Achieving Climate Neutrality, scheduled for 16\u201317 September 2021 in Ljubljana.

We have decided to hold a scientific conference in the light of Europe's efforts to become climate-neutral by 2050, led by new European Commission missions, including the '100 Climate-neutral cities by 2030 - for citizens' mission. In this mission, the Commission will support and promote 100 European cities on their path to carbon neutrality.     The topics of the conference will shed light on some of the issues facing and will be encountered by cities on their path to climate neutrality. Cities and their representatives will gain insight into possible proposals and solutions to the problems that await them in establishing climate neutrality.     The conference will address three topics, all three of which are equally important in achieving climate neutrality. The first topic concerns the production, storage and distribution of renewable energy sources, the second topic presents possible solutions to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, the highest among them. The third topic will address mobility, and how new forms of mobility can help reduce CO2 emissions.     The conference will host experts from various fields at four round tables\/panels, which will shed additional light on the topics that await us on the path to achieving climate neutrality in the coming years.

Launch of the \u201cAlpPlan\u201d alpine spatial planning network     Sunday, January 31, 2021     Sunday, January 31, 2021 0 1480     Launch of the \u201cAlpPlan\u201d alpine spatial planning network     The OpenSpaceAlps project and the Academy for Territorial Development in the Leibniz Association (ARL) join forces to support transnational cooperation in spatial planning     The Alpine region is characterised by successful collaboration in numerous cooperation platforms. There is, though, still too little coordination between states and regions in spatial planning. This is considered crucial for tackling alpine cross-border challenges, such as ensuring ecological connectivity or managing traffic. To facilitate exchange with key stakeholders in the Alpine area, the OpenSpaceAlps project is collaborating with the Academy for Territorial Development in the Leibniz Association (ARL) to jointly establish a spatial planning network: the \u201cAlpPlan network\u201d.     The network addresses experts, planners and decision-makers at all administrative levels as well as interested stakeholders from the private sector. The aim of the network is to facilitate the transnational exchange of experience on planning practices and instruments and thus to contribute to the enhancement of spatial planning in the Alpine region.     AlpPlan network kick-off meeting yields promising results     The kick-off meeting of the AlpPlan network took place as an online conference on 29\/10\/2020. Representatives from the planning practice, ministries and academia discussed the issue of safeguarding open spaces and the future orientation of the network. The discussants agreed that the network must work in close contact with the existing cooperation formats, such as the working groups of the Alpine Convention and EUSALP. As a main benefit of the network, the participants stressed the opportunity to work together on the concrete local and regional implementation of higher-level spatial planning strategies and objectives.     Join the upcoming activities     In 2021, the network is going to host a thematic conference as well as a special capacity-building seminar. In a Memorandum of Cooperation which is being prepared the future members will agree on objectives and working procedures of the network. Moreover, an online platform and a central contact point at ARL will facilitate communication within the network.     We look forward to your participation in the AlpPlan network activities!

UIRS Connecting Nature     Monday, March 30, 2020     Monday, March 30, 2020 0 2434     UIRS Connecting Nature     Project team attended the Training Course Nature based solutions in Urban planning     The course manly focused on environmental aspects of wellbeing in the city and the potential environmental benefits that Nature based solutions (NBS) can bring. Lecturers from different research fields upskilled participants in understanding the ecological foundations of NBS, assessing their impacts on ecosystem services and applying key principles for NBS design.     Green roofs, rain gardens, community gardens and green walls are just some of the Nature based solutions (NBS) defined as \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits\u201d (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016:2).     The NBS research field is progressing rapidly, but the implementation of nature-based solutions in urban planning is still complex and often difficult process. Therefore, in February 2020 a training course \u201cNature based solutions in Urban planning\u201d was organized, at the University of Trento. The course was coordinated by the Horizon 2020 and supported by the project ReNature. Two-day training attended PhD students, post-doc students, research fellows, practitioners, as well as public officers interested in planning and designing NBS to address urban challenges. It was led by the researcher dr. Davide Geneletti, professor of spatial planning at the University of Trento, specialized in impact assessment of projects, plans and policies, spatial and urban planning, ecosystem services and multicriteria analysis.     The Course Focus     The course manly focused on environmental aspects of wellbeing in the city and the potential environmental benefits that NBS can bring. Lecturers from different research fields upskilled participants in understanding the ecological foundations of NBS, assessing their impacts on ecosystem services and applying key principles for NBS design. The teaching approach was based on interrelational lectures, discussions and case study works, conducted in groups. The following main issues were addressed:     Current thinking and experiences in European cities     Urban ecosystems, their biodiversity and functions     Mapping and assessing urban ecosystem services     Analyzing demand for NBS and potential beneficiaries     NBS design to target specific urban needs and challenges     Windows of opportunities and constraints to mainstream NBS in urban plans.     Discussion raised fruitful questions, to expose here some of the most challenging in relations planning-governance-practice-better quality living:     How do we know that NBS works better than other technically solutions of grey infrastructure, and how does the dimension of time affect the sustainability of the grey infrastructure comparing to NBS solutions?     What are the consequences of NBS for the surrounding area and can NBS also have a negative effect(s), such as rising real estate prices in the neighborhood?     How to think about the cities challenges as NBS solution?     Practical exercise     Participants were taken to a field visit in the city center, and then assigned for case studies analysis and design of NBS, considering inputs learnt at the lessons during the course. Case study work conducted in groups followed the process of, firstly identifying city challenges and secondly, proposing the appropriate type of NBS.     The main challenge of the urban planning exercise was to select 4 of the 21 sites, that are classified by the Urban Plan of the City of Trento as urban transformation sites. In the chosen sites we had to propose zoning areas, containing a new residential areas and areas with different type of NBS. The decision on the allocation of zoning areas was dependent on each group, where we had to provide an equivalent proportion of both types of areas within the total surface of the 4 areas.     The planning of NBS is supposed to take a comprehensive approach; therefore, in the area's primary proposed a residential use, our group always included the NBS.     In the Training Course, NBS were also defined within the Ecosystem services (ES) framework. The benefits of NBS planning actions were addressed in terms of changes in human wellbeing, coherently with planning goals that address the specific challenges of the city.     ES were understood as the measured benefits of NBS in terms of the increased provision of several key ES for population wellbeing e.g. climate mitigation and air purification.     We were provided with the GIS database, consisting of two types of analysis:     ES supply, which included the evaluation of the sites in terms of spatial characteristics and their ability to provide certain benefits for the wellbeing of the surrounding population.     ES demand including evaluated areas in terms of potential beneficiaries of improved environmental conditions.     Our group determined 4 areas considering the most problematic areas in terms of environmental challenges and the areas with greatest need for mitigating environmental effect in terms of wellbeing. Our planning objective derived from the analyses of the city area in the frame of mapping the provision of NBS benefits - mapping ES:     ES Air purification consider areas regarding their ability to contribute to better air quality and to remove particulate matter. ES supply analysis assesses areas regarding the different type of vegetation (trees, grass and shrubs) and their proximity to the pollution source (roads). The areas of ES demand were primarily defined as residential areas near busy roads; however, it would also make sense to identify polluted areas, used by people for recreation and socializing (e.g. public spaces, frequently used walking routes).     ES Habitat provision refers to the richness of areas with plant, animal species that are important for the ecological aspects of providing biodiversity in the city. Ecological modeling (Zardo et al., 2017) has considered the potential richness of species biodiversity, hotspots of the biodiversity in the urban area and the ecological value of river ecosystems.     ES Climate regulation refers to the assessment of areas in terms of temperature reduction capacity in Trento. The evaluation process defined the coverage of tree canopy areas and the evaluation of evapotranspiration (ratio of tree canopy cover, soil cover and area size). Areas of demand for ES has been identified in urban areas that are exposed to high temperatures and are inhabited by vulnerable population groups (e.g. children and the elderly).     Food provision ES refers to the assessment of the suitability of an area in relation to the current level of food production and the morphological suitability for agricultural activity (slope, soil and altitude). The analysis also showed areas of demand for ES, where residential areas without a private garden, were assessed regarding the distance to community gardens.     ES Noise mitigation assesses the capacity of vegetation barriers to absorb traffic noise and reduce noise pollution for residential buildings nearby. ES Noise mitigation demand refers to noise level from road and railroads (above 65dB) near residential buildings, but could also consider hospital, educational and recreational areas as a demand for noise mitigation etc.     ES Recreation assesses the areas according to their possibilities of recreation. The evaluation of potential sites was based on the structural characteristics of the area and the ability to identify areas as NBS. Accessibility and infrastructure (e.g. well-maintained cycle lanes and parking facilities) were also considered. The areas of ES demand were defined as residential areas, their assessment varied according to the distance of 300 meters (5min walk) to a quality recreational area.     Runoff mitigation evalues areas regarding the ability to infiltrate and retain stormwater, thus reducing the amount of runoff that enters the sewage system.     Assessment and indicators related to wellbeing of social dimension (e.g. social cohesion, meeting the different needs of different types of users) weren\u2019t use in this assessment, but are also important aspect in the process of spatial planning.     An example of an ES analysis Climate regulation, where a mapping of NBS contributions is mapped in terms of cooling capacity:     The advantage of the method seems to be in the understanding of the NBS as different types of solutions with different spatial components and environmental effects. Current spatial planning practices often address greenery in the city only from a structural point of view or regarding specific functions for residents (e.g. recreation), while NBS concept considers nature primarily from its processes, that can provide pleasant conditions in city.     Further discussion and dilemmas     Although the NBS and ecosystem services (ES) are relatively new concepts and most ES studies, are far from a real-life application, Geneletti (2011) acknowledges the potential of ES assessment to increase the quality of planning processes and decision.     For example, Cortinovis and Geneletti (2018) refine and upgrade the method used in the Training course. The example has not been discussed at Training Course, but it seems important to show its usefulness in real-life urban planning context:     Primer prikazuje primerjavo med obstoje\u010dimi zna\u010dilnostmi obmo\u010dja in scenarijem na\u010drtovanja novega mestnega parka.

Among the pathways described by Posner et al. (2016) the following example shows how to use ES knowledge to generate actions and produce outcomes. The example assesses the cooling effect of urban green infrastructure in city of Trento and recreation opportunity for its residents.

The articles tackles specific issues and address them in the context of key topics such as: the legal and administrative frameworks of managing cultural heritage sites, management approaches and policies, and the challenges posed by cultural tourism.     The introductory article was prepared by Jelka Pirkovi\u010d, where she presents contemporary concepts of heritage management. This is followed by four articles on the challenges of managing and governing heritage sites in Slovenia. \u0160pela Span\u017eel discusses the implementation of UNESCO cultural heritage in Slovenia, and Nata\u0161a Kolenc talks about the challenges of private-public partnership in built heritage restoration. Toma\u017e Golob\u2019s article provides a theoretical overview of participatory management of urban areas of cultural heritage, using several Slovenian cases as examples, while Vlasta Vodeb reports about BhENEFIT project\u2019s best practices related to the use of historic building information modelling (HBIM) methods in managing and monitoring historic building areas.     The next four articles illustrate cases of heritage site management beyond Slovenian borders. The tone of this part is set by Helen Kendrick\u2019s article on the exceptional success of heritage-led regeneration of Glasgow, Scotland. Over the past three decades Glasgow has managed to turn its fortunes around and emerged from its industrial past to become a centre of cultural tourism. The case of Mostar and its connections with cultural tourism, boosted by its inscription on the World Heritage List, are presented in the article by Aida Idrizbegovi\u0107 Zgoni\u0107 and Jasenka \u010cakari\u0107. This monograph is rounded off with an interesting case of the mining town of Almad\u00e9n in Spain \u2013 the twin city of Slovenian Idrija in its inscription on the World Heritage List. Each year Almad\u00e9n\u2019s enthusiasts put on a show of re-enacting its history and raise awareness among the local community and the visitors regarding the significance of heritage values as the best way to promote future development of the city and the region.

OpenSpaceAlps kicks off in Altenmarkt, Austria     Thursday, December 19, 2019     Thursday, December 19, 2019 0 2713     OpenSpaceAlps kicks off in Altenmarkt, Austria     Sustainable development of alpine open spaces by enhancing spatial planning governance     OpenSpaceAlps is one of the fifteen projects approved in the frame of Call 4 of the Interreg Alpine Space programme. It brings together seven partner institutions from Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Slovenia to work on the topic of near-natural open spaces in the core Alpine and EUSALP areas. The partner from Slovenia is the Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia, Ljubljana.     The main objective of the OpenSpaceAlps project is to foster sustainable development of the Alpine area by contributing to the safeguarding of open spaces featuring environmental and natural values. In the valleys, these open spaces are decreasing due to e.g. development of settlements and transport related areas, whereas in the higher altitudes they are being dissected by tourism, forestry and agriculture related infrastructures. The path taken is to initiate and facilitate processes towards adoption of new spatial planning approaches in the alpine countries as well as to promote multi-level, transnational spatial governance.     The initial meeting of the project partners was held in Altenmarkt, Austria, on 5 and 6 November 2019. Beside discussing the first steps in implementation of the project, presentations were held about development of open space planning instruments in the Federal State of Salzburg as well as more generally in the Alpine area.     For additional information about the project please contact the Lead Partner Salzburg Institute for Regional Planning and Housing (SIR) representative Philipp Vesely (+43 662 623 455\/29, openspacealps@salzburg.gv.at ) or Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia (UIRS) representative Andrej Guli\u010d (+386 1 420 1317, andrej.gulic@uirs.si).

She will explain the position of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Commission, as well as the role of the National Institute of Public Health in preparing opinions related to land use planning and action plans. She will present the level of noise pollution for traffic, industry, restaurants and wind turbines and highlight individual cases. As a contrast to noise pollution, she will also describe the role of quiet areas in the urban environment.     Environmental noise has several impacts on human health and well-being. Very loud sounds can cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment even in a short period of time. However, such sounds are not often present in the living environment. There is increasing scientific evidence of the negative effects of permanent noise in the environment even when it does not reach high intensities. Although, many people quickly get used to this noise and accept it as part of their everyday life, health effects are reflected in long-term cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that more than one million healthy life years are lost in Western Europe due to suffering from annoyance, sleep disturbance, cardiovascular disease, tinnitus and cognitive impairment in children. The data indicate the severity of the outcomes that we should not overlook.     Sonja Jeram is a researcher at the National Institute of Public Health in Ljubljana. She holds a PhD in biology from the University of Ljubljana in the field of neurophysiology in insect sound communication. She continued her work in the field of chemical safety and participated as a visiting scientist at the European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (Joint Research Centre, Ispra). For her outstanding work on alternative strategies for reducing animal use in experiments, she received the Doerenkamp-Zbinden Foundation Award. For the last ten years, she has been working on environmental noise and health also being involved in Horizon 2020 European projects.     The lecture is part of a project \u00bbExpert basis for spatial planning of green areas aimed at promoting physical activities for citizens\u00ab.     You are kindly invited to the lecture and the discussion that will follow. More info at info@uirs.si.     An uklad-based approach to protection and sustainable development of cultural heritage in Chisinau, Moldova     Wednesday, September 25, 2019     Wednesday, September 25, 2019 0 9054     An uklad-based approach to protection and sustainable development of cultural heritage in Chisinau, Moldova     Irina Irbiskaya     Library of the Urban Planning Institute of Republic of Slovenia, October 1st 2019 at 5pm, lecture in English and free of charge     Irina Irbiskaya will discuss the uklad-based approach to preservation of cultural heritage in the Republic of Moldova. An uklad is a persistent way of life \/ mode of activity which has a spatial expression. The ways uklads exist in the city differ according to the size and the role of a city (e.g. capital city, a regional administrative center or a small town). An uklad is characterized by the prevalent family culture, by its attitude to the surrounding space, by the manner in which people belonging to the uklad are aware of their past and construct their future, by how they perceive their children, how they interact with their territory and their neighbors, how they own their property and treat others' property, and by how they work and spend their leisure time. The uklad-based approach to preservation of cultural heritage is elaborated within the framework of the \u2018Russian Experts upon request\u2019 program in accordance with Partnership Framework Agreement between the Government of Russian Federation and the UN Development Program.     Irina Irbitskaya is an architect and urban planner. She is the director of the Center of Urban Competence at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) with expertise in housing projects and urban development and planning advancement. She is a co-founder of the international project Doktor Gorodov.     You are kindly invited to the lecture and the discussion that will follow.

The aim was to learn the vanishing art of karstic drystone walling along with rebuilding an old wall, which was in very poor condition. We knew that the result, i.e. a beautifully restored wall, would add value to this World Heritage Site, and show visitors a real karstic drystone wall.     The participants of these voluntary workshops were eager to learn individuals of all ages that do care about this distinct segment of the traditional karst cultural landscape.     Following the guidance and instructions of local mentors, the participants demolished the old wall built without mortar, cleaned up the surroundings and began with the rebuilding. In the shade of the trees, the work had a good run. Hardworking hands have turned stones until they placed them in the right position, and so the wall slowly received its final form.     We want this wall to represent a lasting memory, and a good example of the karstic drystone wall construction for our visitors from all over the world, so we kindly ask you to respect our work and effort, and help us maintain the wall.

XBR Z9G Series 03.03.2021 od JTPHINNEY     I can\u2019t believe the picture and the sound of this TV. It was worth every Penny! We use to never watch tv down stairs... Now that is where we spend most of our tv watching time...     Less than 1 month old and the picture went blank.     XBR Z9G Series 11.01.2021 od Karnivor     I purchased this tv knowing it was one of the best available. However after watching tv for less than 10 hours total, I turned it on and the pic was blank and it had randomly spaced green pixels on the lower right hand portion of the screen. HELP SONY     Great picture, Colors are amazing!!     XBR Z9G Series 14.12.2020 od Gojohnny81     I\u2019ve had this tv two months, But the android on this TV is horrible, I have sound and no picture keep rebooting rebooting to get picture back!! Don\u2019t know what to do?!I should have reboot the tv everyday to watch direct tv?!     Das beste HDR Bild auf dem Markt     215 cm (85 palcev) 24.11.2020     Service mehr als gut und in allen Punkten Bestnoten. Gro\u00dfen Dank an Oli von Heimkino GmbH und sein Team. Tv leichte Schw\u00e4chen bei den Smart Apps, Panel aber \u00fcber jeden Zweifel erhaben.     Super clean panel! Great picture!     XBR Z9G Series 30.10.2020     I own 2 Z9Ds 75. Great sets with very little dirty screens. Z9G... I can\u2019t see any imperfections! Clean panel awesome picture! Only reason I don\u2019t give it 5 stars is because Sony still hasn\u2019t released the update for the hdmi 2.1 port. Z9G isn\u2019t cheap so.... When will the update be available so I can plug my PC to game at 8k 60fps?????!?? I\u2019m sure that I am NOT the only one waiting!     Good Picture but Sound, not so much...     XBR85Z9G 13.09.2020 od nljgimd     The picture quality in this television is outstanding however the operating system and audio characteristics leave a lot to be desired for a device of this projected quality. The Android operating system cripples this television and the sound is not as robust as one would expect of a television of this ilk. The remote control is not backlit illuminated either. As I stated at the outset, there is no doubt that the picture quality is definitely superior, the physical appearance is also very robust and if you are not mounting the unit, the legs allow for a sound at that you will need. TV is expensive and for the price Sony should have provided a whole lot more processing options in the menus to permit better optimization of the operating system, the way Sony used to in earlier times. I have owned several flagship units made by Sony and this is somewhat disappointing in terms of system flexibility.     Super sharp bright picture.     XBR85Z9G 20.08.2020 od DJRC     Definitely has some candlepower. I was getting tired of not being able to view dark scenes. This tv definitely brightens things up. Great upscaling. Not much more you could ask for except some true 8K content. A little disappointed that Sony doesnt provide a demo for customers that purchase this tv.     Superb picture with great sound -     215 cm (85 palcev) 20.04.2020 od Ian_     I purchased this to replace a 65\"4K TV that had failed. On researching all the TV types of 65\" and over, I came across several five-star reviews for this 85\" monster and thought, why not. Wow, is all I can say, I have had the TV for ten day's now and can say this, it has the best picture I have ever seen, period. For me, any noticeable DSE (Dirty Screen Effect) would have been a massive negative, this screen is an absolute gem, No visible DSE at all, just pure white all over and so bright. Positives for me are - No visible DSE just a pure white screen, major importance for me. Fantastic whites that pop at you from the screen. Great colours and skin tones. Good contrast. So bright a picture and can be used in a normally bright room with no problem, unlike some OLED TVs that are better in a dark room. Great black depth. Very good TV speaker sound. The speed at which this TV works with the Android system is a pleasure to use with No lag in response to the remote control command and you can scroll through the apps at great speed. On updating the firmware to the latest version the Home screen apps appear to be of a higher resolution than before with clearer on-screen icons. The motion handling, normally I would turn off any motion handling as I dislike the 'soap opera' video effect, But on this TV and with Sony's excellent algorithm it is very good indeed and I use it at a low setting. Blooming is not a noticed issue for me with general viewing being excellent all round. The perceived Negatives for me were - The quoted electric consumption of 636 watts, with the brightness set to a normal level for standard viewing without the need for the viewer to wear Sun Glasses it uses electricity at a much more friendly rate of about 235-250 watts, so this is a bonus for me. It will, of course, use more in electricity in HDR mode, but that is not normal day time viewing, only from HDR BluRays. The top and bottom black bars on a widescreen presentation in a normal daylight lit room are fine, in a totally dark room they are affected by adjacent white scenes and some minor blooming being evident by making the bars slightly lighter at times, some soft lighting in the room takes care of that for me and is not a big issue if it was a big issue I would have gone the OLED route, but then I would miss out on the punchy brightness and colours of the KD-85ZG9 which is wonderful to watch. Also on day one, the 85\" TV looked massive in comparison to the old 65\" TV that it replaced, but as before two or three days later you get perfectly accustomed to the newly acquired audio-visual experience. I did not go out specifically looking to buy a monster 85\" TV and would probably have gone for a 75\" upgrade in size, the Sony Master series 8K TV only comes in 85\" or 98\" so if I wanted the best TV Sony currently offer within my price range this has to be it. On reflection, I'm glad that my hand was forced to buy a bigger screen size than I thought I needed because once it is set up you soon get used to the bigger size, yes it dominates the lounge, so what, bigger is better in my view and with that lovely 8K resolution even though there are currently no 8k sources, my photos look lovely when presented on the TV screen, buyers remorse, none, if you can afford it, just get it, you won't be disappointed, it is built to a very high standard and totally solid, and heavy. Almost forgot about the lovely new metal-faced remote which is voice-enabled, you press a button on the remote and speak, Google will find what you require on youtube, etc, also because it is an Android TV you can download apps from the Google play store to add to the TV's functionality. Overall, extremely pleased with my lovely New Sony 85ZG9     Awesome TV     XBR Z9G Series 01.03.2020 od Paco G     I got this tv for my 50th birthday as a present to me it was this or a brand new car and I\u2019m totally very happy with my Z9G 8K TV, before this I had the Sony XBR79x900B That I purchased in 2015 and it was awesome too but this tv takes it to another level in definition and quality you can\u2019t compared a Sony with a LG tv it\u2019s comparing a BMW with a Ford, Sony in my mind is the best Tv company ever. Thank you     Great     XBR Z9G Series 27.02.2020 od Arun R     Sony - Z9G | MASTER Series | LED | 8K | High Dynamic Range (HDR) | Smart TV (Android TV) Very Good Product     excellent picture but!     XBR Z9G Series 26.02.2020 od Hi Tech Calibrator     Excellent picture with the HDR and BT 2020 Bit engage but the 8K port is bad ,can not get a 4K source to play without problems.For example either there is no picture at all or spots all over the entire screen it doesn't matter if a video source is on it or not ,I hope when the 2.1 HDMI port is available that Sony will swap it out! \"Note Sony\" My My Audio and Video technical skills are Advanced so don't throw up some basic responses you read off a sheet the port is BAD!     Great picture BUT!     XBR Z9G Series 22.10.2019 od robdman     Very buggy ,I have done 4 master resets to correct sound, picture twice and just today flashing.for me paying over $13,000.00 I should not have these problems!     Reboot after reboot     XBR Z9G Series 13.09.2019 od Charlie1234567890     Had the tv for almost a month. Picture is outstanding. Software is God awful. android tv has to be rebooted and rebooted. Super hard to navigate. Get ready to put your usernames and passwords in again and again. Reset and reboot. Put in passwords again. Reset reboot and repeat. Errors and errors. Why Sony would put this junk software into such a nice tv is beyond me.     magnifique t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur et superbe technique     215 cm (85 palcev) 20.07.2019 od Rem81     j'ai achet\u00e9 ce tv en remplacement du samsung QE85 900R qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 2 fois (raies vertes et bleues vericales apparues sur l'\u00e9cran 2 fois!)     Simply Stunning !!     XBR Z9G Series 17.07.2019 od gab5     Am a new owner of this particular model, in the 85-inch class. My self-described review title is worth repeating - Simply Stunning. Viewing this this television, using an upscaled 4K Ultra DVD, almost leads the viewer to believe as though he\/she were looking through a window - it's that good. If you desire a no-compromise viewing experience, look no further than the amazing Z9G !!

Optical encoders video channel     Watch the videos to learn about our optical encoder technology and determine which encoder is right for you.     Global presence, local service     As a world leader in position feedback technology with a global support network, Renishaw is a regular attendee of the SPS IPC exhibition, where our local teams demonstrate our latest innovations, such as industry leading absolute RESOLUTE and miniature incremental ATOM encoders.     [1920 x 1080] [235.2MB]     Case studies\/Feature articles     Discover how Technical Leader Dr. Finlay Evans and his team raced to innovate special digital position sensors (encoders) for the Land Rover BAR race yacht. The solution enables the helmsman and crew to race the yacht with precise wing and rudder feedback whilst enabling the capture of high-quality performance data during development and training.     Manufacturing error-free flat panel displays is a challenge, because as display performance improves, manufacturing processes become more complex and panel defects can become more common. Inspection and repair procedures have been developed to ensure that errors have minimal effect on display quality. Renishaw's ATOM encoder system has been integrated into a variable aperture stop design. Precise manipulation of the laser aperture, in the range of 5 - 50 microns (um) in diameter, is vital to ensure successful panel repair. Discover in full how TPC Motion integrated the ATOM series encoder at: www.renishaw.com\/tpc-atom     Encoders are a key part of vehicular LiDAR systems that are used to accurately map vast road infrastructure. LiDAR scanning systems provide precise and accurate co-ordinate measurement data that is used to create realistic and detailed 3D city models viewable from street-level. LiDAR scanning systems consist of a laser range-finder with rotating scan mirror and various positioning and orientation systems. These systems capture 360\u00b0 3D point cloud data whilst rotating at more than 1000 RPM.

It tries to help them on their personal artistic journey by not only donating money, buying instruments or paying for tuition fees but also by helping them to interact and cooperate with relevant institutions, artists and educators from across the globe. It does so with its partner organisation, the Gallus J. Carniolus Institute.     The foundation carries out its programme by way of donations, given by private entities supportive of its mission, especially its 18 founders, a group of successful Slovene companies. However, significant contributions also come from individual music and art lovers.     Contents     Background     Though the project's history stretches back a few years more, one could say it was established in 1990, when it was set up under the name Gallus Fund alongside the Gallus Concert Agency. Both were managed by Gallus Carniolus Ltd. up until 1996 when they became two separate NGOs. However, they've remained a singular project to this day.     The agency itself is now managed by the Gallus J. Carniolus Institute, which functions also as a publishing house and a concert producer, offering consulting services in the field of cultural management and organisation.     Gallus foundation prot\u00e9g\u00e9s     Since its establishment, the Gallus Foundation has supported more than 50 young talented musicians (mostly dealing with either classical or jazz music) with stipends for training at well-known academies and other music education institutions. For many of them, it has organised joint concerts with well-known musicians at eminent venues.     A number of the foundation's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9s have become (or are bidding to become) prominent and internationally respected musical artists. Among them are the guitarists Mak Grgi\u0107, Nejc Kuhar, Uro\u0161 Rakovec and Domen Gnezda; the harpist Mojca Zlobko Vajgl; the clarinettist Mate Bekavc; the violinists Anja Bukovec and Tanja Sonc; the pianist Aleksej Pudinov (RU); and the accordionist Primo\u017e Parovel.     International projects     In 2017, Gallus Foundation joined the 2-year Creative Europe co-funded project International Classical Music Masterclasses \u2013 ARDEA, a transnational network of 3 organisations located in Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Together they provide a complex project of musical education for young talented classical musicians, foremost by jointly exposing them to masterclasses with internationally renowned musicians.

Core Benefits     Control your time series data     Standardised (ENTSO-E) data exchange     Automate imbalance settlement calculations     Importer and Time Series Data Management     Data acquisition, validation, aggregation and substitution     User managed business rules importer engine     Data quality management     XML configuration storage for adaptable data source integrations     Time series data management is based on state-of-the-art, user managed business rules importer engine. It includes automated and scheduled uploading, validating, and data aggregation from different (measurements, price, weather, etc) data sources. Introduces optimized bulk-import of large data, based on latest big data manipulation technologies. integrated data quality management (DQM) provides quality assessment, design, transforming and monitoring based on proven DQM KPI's. Importer supports major standards for energy schedule reporting (ESS, KISS), as well as user defined reporting in different formats (XML, XLS, CSV\u2026).     Balance scheme management     Balance scheme structure and membership management     Supports ENTSO-E data exchange and reporting     Reporting of delivery points included in balance scheme     The application supports management of membership and structure of the balance scheme, defined with the balancing agreements. Within the functionality the process of keeping, updating, and publishing the record of balance scheme membership contracts is provided. Moreover, the reporting and management of delivery points included in the balance scheme is supported.     Transaction management     Contracts and operational forecast recording     Building up balance scheme market plans     TSO operation schedule     Imbalance settlements     Recording of contracts and operational forecasts represent the basis for drawing up balance scheme members' market plans, which are used for drawing up an indicative operating schedule of the transmission system operator and, later, for calculating the imbalance settlement. The application supports import and management of all closed contracts for export and import and all concluded transactions on the exchange. On the basis of the quantities of bought and sold electricity in recorded closed contracts, the application calculates a market plan for balance scheme members.     Allocations, Nominations and Matching     Automatic validation of transaction cycles     Fully customised matching procedure     The system can support separate long term and short term nomination cycles. The nominations are automatically validated against capacity agreements allocated by local system operator, counter system operator or external auction office. Each nomination cycle ends with one or more succeeding matching cycles, which can be fully customized (e.g. aggregation of time series, single side or parallel matching, initiating\/participating or receiving\/matching operator \u2026). The final short term matching cycle can be marked as a cut-off cycle, so that the mismatched time series are automatically adjusted and final confirmation reports sent to balance responsible parties accordingly.     Imbalance settlement     Calculation of individual BG member net position     Pre and final imbalance settlements     The application prepares net position of an individual balance scheme member on the organized market and is an outcome of all closed contracts concluded by a balance scheme member for each accounting interval according to recorded closed contracts.

        "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Questions and answers on virtual currencies     Frequently asked questions and answers about virtual currencies     General information about virtual currencies     What are virtual currencies?     Virtual currencies (including cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin), are a form of unregulated digital representation of value that is neither issued nor backed by a central bank or a public authority, nor necessarily attached to a fiat currency, but is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of payment, and can be transferred, stored or traded electronically.     The term virtual currency is in widespread use, but according to an opinion of the European Central Bank, \u201cvirtual currencies do not qualify as currencies from a Union perspective\u201d. The ECB further states that \u201cgiven that virtual currencies are not in fact currencies, it would be more accurate to regard them as a means of exchange, rather than as a means of payment\u201d.     Are entities that provide for the purchase, storage and trading of virtual currencies systemically regulated and supervised? What does this mean for users?     Stakeholders in virtual currency schemes that facilitate the purchase (e.g. trade platforms), storage (e.g. digital wallet providers) and trading of virtual currencies in Slovenia are not systemically regulated and supervised. This means that no authority licenses or supervises these entities from the perspective of the adequacy of their risk management (operational risk and cyber resilience are particularly relevant), the expertise of employees in providing the services in question, the adequacy of transactions with users, etc. In consequence, investors in virtual currencies should be aware of the specifics of this type of investment, and should weigh up whether the risks taken up align with their personal preferences and investment objectives.     For consumers thinking of purchasing virtual currencies     What are the risks associated with holding virtual currencies?     The European Banking Authority has identified several attributes and risks that users of virtual currencies should be aware of. The following risks are the most notable of these:     you can lose your money on the trade platform;     your money can be stolen from your digital wallet;     if you use virtual currencies as a means of payment, you are not protected as in the case of a transfer from a payment (current) account;     the value of a virtual currency that you hold may be volatile and may even fall to zero.     Given the increased interest in virtual currencies, the Bank of Slovenia informed consumers back in 2013 of the relevant warning by the EBA. A warning with regard to the risks inherent in holding virtual currencies was additionally issued on 9 October 2017 by the Financial Stability Board, which is chaired by the Bank of Slovenia. Last year the FSB also established a working group for cyber risk and financial technology (fintech), which will also discuss issues related to virtual currencies.     What should an individual be particularly attentive to when deciding to purchase virtual currencies?     Before purchasing virtual currencies, an individual should at least address questions such as the following:     Who is the entity with whom I would purchase the virtual currency?     How is the individual currency issued? How does the entity with whom I will obtain the virtual currency function? Have I been provided with sufficient information and clear answers to all of my questions?     What are the fees (commission) that I will pay (i) to acquire units of virtual currency, and (ii) to transfer\/sell these units.     In which country is (the head of) the entity with whom I am concluding a contract, and what is the legislation there (tax arrangements, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, etc.)?     What\/who guarantees that I will be able to convert my virtual currency units back into fiat currency, and how? Will my inward payment be used to cover outward payments to the investors selling these virtual currency units (a Ponzi scheme)? How quickly can I carry out the process of converting the virtual currency into fiat currency?     What entitlements do I earn by investing? Does the particular virtual currency scheme even allow for conversion back to fiat currency?     How can I store the units of virtual currency that I obtain? How secure is this method of storage, and by whom and how is the security guaranteed? What fees (commission) will I pay for storing virtual currency units?     What legal remedies are available to me should I be the victim of fraud or deception, and will I be refunded in such an event?     What is the tax treatment of virtual currencies and investing in them? What are the resulting tax liabilities? Answers to this question can also be found in the clarifications by the Financial Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (in Slovene only).     We suggest that anyone who lacks the information to be able to answer questions such as those cited above should demand clear answers from the entity with whom he or she is purchasing the virtual currency, or should reconsider whether a purchase of this type is sensible. Even if a well-informed individual opts for such a purchase, it is recommended that the amount invested should not constitute an excessive exposure, and that he or she should be aware that it could be lost.     For potential providers of services related to virtual currencies     Are virtual currencies foreign currencies?     Virtual currencies cannot be defined as foreign currencies, as the Foreign Exchange Act (ZDP-2) defines foreign cash, the purchase and sale of which is classed as the regulated activity of currency exchange operations, as banknotes and coins in a foreign currency issued by a central bank or government. Entities that provide the exchange of virtual currencies from and into traditional fiat currencies therefore do not require a Bank of Slovenia authorisation to provide currency exchange operations pursuant to the ZDP-2.     Are virtual currencies electronic money? Can payment services be provided in virtual currencies?     According to all of the information at our disposal about the conceptual forms of virtual currency known today, the use of their own denomination means that they cannot be considered a digital replacement for banknotes and coins of traditional fiat currencies, but are instead units of a specific virtual currency (e.g. bitcoin or ether) or a digital form of entirely different content (a token with intellectual property rights, a token as the medium of a hybrid loan agreement, a token as proof of donation with a combination of the option of the use of a service or a refund, etc.). Virtual currencies of this type therefore do not satisfy the criteria for definition as electronic money, and consequently cannot be defined as the subject of electronic money issuance services in accordance with the Payment Services and Systems Act (ZPlaSS). Because according to their known attributes virtual currencies cannot be defined as either one of the two forms of money alongside electronic money, namely cash (banknotes and coins) and book scriptural money, they also cannot be the subject of payment services in accordance with the ZPlaSS.     Can virtual currencies be used legally for payment?     The Euro Introduction Act (ZUE) defines banknotes and coins denominated in euros as legal tender in Slovenia (which points of sale are required to accept), and supervision of the implementation of this provision of the ZUE is conducted by the Market Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia. The cited provision of the ZUE does not place any constraints on merchants and points of sale in deciding to accept other means of payment, be they regulated (e.g. payment instruments, electronic money, foreign currencies) or unregulated (barter, new means of payment such as virtual currencies, etc.). It is not illegal to accept virtual currencies as means of payment in Slovenia (and in the EU). It is nevertheless recommended that holders of virtual currencies who wish would like to use them for payment check in advance with regard to (any) fees and commissions that they would pay to this end.     Virtual currencies are also subject of consideration by other institutions; some of the relevant links are cited below: "

TuCAHEA's full title is \"Towards a Central Asian Higher Education Area: Tuning Structures and Building Quality Culture\". It is a Tempus Structural Measures project which will run from 15 October 2012 to 14 October 2015. There are 47 partners, including 8 European Union Universities, 34 Central Asian Universities, and the Ministries of Education of the five partner countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.     Building on the Tuning methodology developed worldwide by academics in collaboration with students, graduates, administrators, employers and ministries. TuCAHEA aims to extend the use of competence-based quality tools for planning and delivery of degree programmes, enhance regional higher education systems, create a platform for sharing knowledge and elaborating quality tools across the region and in each country. It encourages legislation to create regional cohesion in alignment with the EHEA; it will establish pilot Tuning Subject Area Groups able to formulate Guidelines and Reference Points for key disciplinary and thematic sectors; it trains ministerial, academic and independent experts in the use of competence-based tools, it fosters student mobility within and outside the region and tests and perfects the quality and recognition tools necessary for mobility; it establishes information \/ dissemination centres in both capitals and other areas of the partner countries.     The principal outcomes will be to extend knowledge of the worldwide Tuning process, involving the Central Asian area directly in Tuning's broad international context; to enhance knowledge of existing quality and recognition tools as a basis for further elaboration; to carry out consultations on both generic and subject specific competences, to produce a number of Tuning Subject Area reports; to produce competence\/learning-outcomes-based descriptions of degree programmes using the Degree Profile template developed by Tuning and the ENIC-NARIC Network, and more generally to creating a basis for a Central Asian Higher Education Area, developing premises for a Central Asian Qualifications Framework and Credit System.

Because of this, new interdisciplinary theoretical and analytical methods and approaches are needed to improve our understanding of the shifting patterns of such practices in different parts of the world, with a particular focus on tackling its proliferation in the new media and radicalisation of online space in the contemporary, increasingly multicultural information society.     The aim of this colloquium is to give an overview of these phenomena as well as research and legal practices in Europe, USA, Japan and New Zealand in order to address the specific issues pertaining to the propagation of intolerant, abusive and hate content in the new media and to contribute to a better understanding thereof as well as to devise strategies for their containment and mitigation. The talks presented at the colloquium tackle a wide range of topics and on-line platforms, such as nationalist discourse on an on-line forum of white supremacy groups or explicitly and implicitly abusive discourse against the LGBTQ+ community of Twitter. The authors use a rich set of methodological frameworks, ranging from discourse-historical approaches to discourse studies to machine learning. The colloquium also offers a comprehensive legal analysis and recommendations for an improved treatment of hate speech in the new era from 10 EU countries as well as a contribution on hate speech that spills over the virtual world and enters the real-world streets.     TALK 1     Hate speech: what definition? What solutions?     Fabienne Baider, University of Cyprus, Cyprus     On 31 May 2016, the Commission and main IT Companies made public a Code of conduct targeting illegal hate speech online. The parameters chosen by the Commission are grounded in the Council Framework Decision 2008\/913\/JHA of 2008. In this framework hate speech is confined to illegal speech defined as an open call to violence or hatred against specific groups, targeted because of their race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. This study presents and analyses the results obtained within the EU program CONTACT focusing on online hate speech. In particular it evaluates the data from 10 countries within the EU. From these data we work out recommendation and a working definition of hate speech as \u2018abusive speech, calling for violence or hatred or not, against specific groups of people because of their origins, religion, including as well gender or sexual orientation\u2019. Some our conclusions include:     1. the necessity to use classification of hate speech based on prior studies carried out in the specific sociocultural context under study; so as to show how the EU definition may tone down the extent of illegal hate speech by using restrictive definition. Indeed we put forward the arguments for including legal hate speech in our data, a decision based on the reasoning that such speech may precede, accompany or provide the context for illegal hate speech;     2. the necessity to adopt a discourse analysis focused on specific and high frequency stereotypical words for specific groups and to avoid thinking of hate speech as the use of a common abusive languages for all groups but;     3. the need to take into account implicatures i.e. the implicit of dehumanizing metaphors or sarcasms. These implicatures do play role in escalating violence     4. The need for any automatic detection of illegal hate speech of contextualized research in the specific culture under study.     TALK 2     Bigotry online: Commenters responses to the \u2018give nothing\u2019 to racism campaign in New Zealand     Philippa Smith, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand     With a growing concern about the encroachment of \u2018subtle\u2019 racism (Ikuenobe, 2011) in New Zealanders\u2019 daily behaviour, this nation\u2019s Human Rights Commission, on 15 June 2017, sought to draw public attention to its pervasiveness by launching the \u2018give nothing\u2019 campaign. As part of this campaign the Commission engaged the New Zealander of the year \u2013 film director Taika Waititi \u2013 to front a satirical video which mimicked the style of a charity seeking support for a noble cause. In this case the irony was the request for New Zealanders to \u201cgive nothing to racism and the spread of intolerance\u201d (HRC, 2017). The video sought to use humour to make people more conscious of their choice of words and actions that, while subtle, could be racially offensive.     Taking the view that satire, as a \u2018discursive act\u2019, is only successful if the satiree (whoever received the satire) accepts it (Simpson, 2003), this study examines 115 online comments to gauge whether the satire was accepted or not, and in what ways commenters responded. Using the \u2018discourse-historical\u2019 approach of critical discourse studies (Wodak & Reisigl, 2001; 2009), I review the video and the online comments to understand the linguistic features and discursive strategies that operate in a triangle of relationships between the satirist, the satiree and the target (Simpson, 2003). Findings showed that while some commenters happily supported the campaign, the majority of them used the online platform for trolling and overt expressions of racism which, in itself offered some irony as to the campaign\u2019s concern with subtle racism.

TALK 3     What Does Hate Look Like: Twitter Discourse on LGBTQ+ in Slovenia     Vojko Gorjanc, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia     Since Twitter, as one of the main social platforms, plays an important part (also) in forming gender and sexual identities, we decided to perform a corpus-based study on the Twitter discourse pertaining to the LGBTQ+ community in Slovenia. The corpus for our study was extracted from the Janes corpus of Slovene user-generated content, which contains almost 215 million tokens of Slovene blog posts and comments, forum posts, news comments, tweets, etc. The corpus is rich in annotated socio-demographic and linguistic metadata, such as account type, author\u2019s gender and region as well as at the text level, such as text or sentiment. For the purpose of our study we extracted a sub-corpus of Twitter accounts of two key referendum campaign players who either supported or opposed the change of Slovenian legislation at the end of 2015, together with a) all tweets connected with both campaign with campaign hashtags and b) tweets with additional hashtags identified in previous context.     Our corpus analysis is quantitative and qualitative in its nature. The quantitative analysis with key words and sentiment analysis provides basic hints about the discourse used for the subsequent qualitative analysis. The qualitative approach is based on content analysis, followed by a critical discourse analysis exposing how one social group imposes power control over the other, and tries to limit the freedom of action of others, using the concepts of \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d as key concepts in forming gender and sexual identities.     We will show how persistent heteronormativity is\u2014also in Twitter discourse; so much so that it seems natural, whereas any counterforce is seen as disruptive, and this is a key factor for abusive discourse against the LGBTQ+ community. Since the qualitative analysis has been conducted manually, we also focused on the non-verbal parts of discourse. Our analysis thus shows that images in posts are very powerful discourse elements, both when the text is explicitly abusive as well as in cases when the verbal parts of tweets remains neutral on the surface, with or without abusive subtext, however with a very explicit abusive non-verbal component.     TALK 4     Hate Speech on Street Level in Japan \u2013 Interaction and Discourse between Hate Groups and Target Groups     Goran Vaage, Kobe College, Japan     Hate speech comes in many forms, both in terms of linguistic content and context. Furthermore, these two usually correlate in that hate speech from political organizations and other organized groups tends to centre around publicized covert racism, whereas at the other end of the spectrum, hate speech in computer mediated communication is often anonymous, derogatory and direct. Hate speech on street level, that is to say demonstrations, actual speeches, posters and such, falls between these two vertices, being semi-organized, taking place in the public space, but still being personal.     This talk analyses the interaction and discourse between hate groups and target groups on street level in Japan, based on a corpus gathered from fieldwork in the Kansai region of Japan in 2016 and 2017, other primary sources such as media coverage, and directions from stakeholder groups, for example banner wording recommendations.     The data suggests that the discourse from hate groups in Japan can be divided broadly into three types, ranging from discontent with current laws, welfare systems, and court decisions, urging members of target groups as well as the Japanese people to various measures, and more or less direct expressions of hate towards a certain target group or nation state. On the other hand, the discourse of the target groups and their campaigners, often outnumbering the hate groups, is more diverse, ranging from political counterarguments, explanations to by passers, offers of friendship, calls and protests against racism, to counterattacks on hate groups. The choice of message and discourse on both sides appears to be mostly a matter of personal choice, and even though the heat of the interaction can at times escalate, participants are in the public space where Japanese rules for social conduct still seem to apply, demonstrating that hate speech on street level is also a social act.     TALK 5     Chatbot abuse     Darja Fi\u0161er, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute and University of Ljubljana, Slovenia     Toma\u017e Erjavec, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Slovenia     Conversational agents, such as chatbots on the web, virtual assistants on smartphones and automated call handing systems are software agents which perform tasks or services for their users (Cassell 2000). As they are being introduced into everyday tasks and technologies, human-computer interaction is becoming an increasingly important research topic not only in computer science where researchers\u2019 primary concern is how to create a machine that can hold a conversation, but also in communication studies and social sciences where the social role of conversational agents is only starting to be investigated. One of the most underresearched phenomena in human interaction with conversational agents is the abusive behaviour of the users towards the agent, which is much higher in both volume and intensity, than in human-human interaction (Bartneck et al. 2005).     In this talk we present the results of a corpus analysis of the abusive language in conversations with the first on-line implementation of the first chatbot Eliza (Brade\u0161ko and Mladeni\u0107 2012). The chatbot, which was developed in 1966 and mimics the behaviour of a Rogerian psychologist, uses simple pattern matching and reformulates users\u2019 sentences into questions (see Figure 2). It is freely available on-line for visitors to use as they like, there is no additional documentation, specified rules or foreseen goals apart from a short prompt that acts as a conversation starter (see Figure 1).     The corpus contains all the conversations anonymous users held with Eliza over a period of 5 years (between 2002-12-19 and 2007-11-26), amounting to a total of 5.7 million conversations or 22.1 billion words. The goal of the corpus analysis is to investigate abusive language in computer-mediated settings in general and to contribute towards a better understanding of linguistic manifestations of abusive behaviour of users when engaging with conversational agents, their triggers, functions and consequences.

TALK 6     Darja Fi\u0161er, University of Ljubljana and Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Slovenia     Nikola Ljube\u0161i\u0107, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Slovenia     Toma\u017e Erjavec, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Slovenia     With the unprecedented volume and speed of spreading information on social media, content providers, government institutions, non-governmental organizations and social media users alike are facing an increasingly daunting task to identify and respond to the spread of intolerant and abusive content in a timely and efficient fashion, before hateful content can cause substantial harm. To address this issue, we propose an automatized approach that employs state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to identify and classify socially unacceptable online discourse practices (SUD).     In this talk we present the legal framework, annotation schema and dataset of SUD practices for Slovene as well as the prototype tool for automatic identification and classification of SUD on the Facebook pages of the most popular mass media in Slovenia that are being developed within the national basic research project FRENK (http:\/\/nl.ijs.si\/frenk\/english\/).     We believe the annotation schema, dataset and tool are the key stepping stones towards the a comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment of the linguistic, sociological, legal and technological dimensions of various forms of socially unacceptable discourse practices in Slovenia. From an applied perspective, the classifier has a big potential to be integrated into the daily work of moderators of discussions on the most popular forums and administrators of readers\u2019 comments on the biggest online media sites who cannot cope with the volume of posts with manual methods and are finding simple, in-house-built lexicon methods insufficient.     On a more theoretical note, we hope that research will result in a thorough examination of the characteristics of socially unacceptable discourse as a linguistic phenomenon and the social context in which explicit or implicit forms of discriminatory language are manifested. What is more, these insights will facilitate an improved understanding of the differences between legally acceptable and unacceptable forms of communication. "

The sampling frame is crucial for research quality because it is supposed to identify all units of the target population.     Sampling unit. The researchers must specify who or what they are studying.     Sampling method. How to select the individuals whose characteristics will be studied-sample size. The key question is how many individuals must the research include so that the results are reliable and that time and budget limitations are not exceeded.     Sample size. It is essential to determine how many persons must we include into a research to obtain reliable results and at the same time not get over budget and miss deadlines.     There are two basic sample types:     Probability samples, where units of the population have an a priori known and nonzero probability of being included in the sample. When discussing web surveys, probability samples are strongly influenced by noncoverage and sampling frame problems. Noncoverage error arises because all elements of target population do not have access to the Internet. Sampling frame error arises because invitations to web surveys are usually shared through email and there are no complete records of email addresses of all internet users. An increase in sample size helps decrease sampling error.     Nonprobability samples, where units of the population do not have an a priori known and nonzero probability of being included in the sample. Lower costs are the prevalent reason that most web surveys are based on nonprobability panels.     Statistical inference (i.e. drawing conclusions about the population based on a sample) is only possible by using a probability sample. Web surveys seem less intrusive and easily traceable when compared to traditional surveys, but companies can't acquire opinions of people without computers, computer illiterate people or older population not yet touched by computer revolution without the use of classic paper questionnaires and telephone surveys. But more and more people have access to the worldwide web. Web surveys can be carried out in three different ways:     General invitations:     There is no list of individuals who were invited to participate in the survey.     Nonprobability samples are employed.     Individual invitations:     There is a list of individuals who were invited to participate in the survey.     Such surveys can be based on either probability or nonprobability samples.     Intercept surveys:     There is no list of individuals that were invited to participate in the survey before it was carried out. Instead, such a list is formed while the survey is in progress by using some form of probability sampling.     Intercept surveys are a special category of probability web surveys.     We know multiple ways of surveying:     Respondents can volunteer themselves without any encouragement and without any individual urging. From the point of sampling we can't talk about probability sampling, where value of inclusion of each unit from population is known before and where each unit has a positive value of probability to be included, in this case.     When researching users of, for example, the Internet, lists of email addresses represent sample frames. On this basis we can then choose units into the sample and then invite them into the survey.     1KA users can easily disseminate survey invitations. An invitation is created in two simple steps, whereas the questionnaire link can be automatically sent via e-mail. If a list of respondents is not available, it is possible to embed the questionnaire link into an existing web page (e.g. banner ad). "

        "text":" A safe, low-carbon energy source     Thanks to its high nominal capacity and reliable supply of electricity countrywide, Kr\u0161ko Nuclear Power Plant (NEK) plays a critical role in the national electric power grid by:     ensuring grid stability,     maintaining stable voltage conditions in the transmission of electricity,     helping keep electricity prices stable in Slovenia, and     enhancing the reliability of supply and the independence from external factors.     The electricity from NEK accounts for roughly 40% of the country's total electricity production. One-half of it goes to the Republic of Croatia, the co-owner of the power plant. Nuclear energy is an essential component of the GEN Group's production portfolio, considering that most of the country's electricity is generated at Kr\u0161ko Nuclear Power Plant (NEK). In 2020, 82% of the GEN Group's total electricity output came from nuclear energy.     How Kr\u0161ko Nuclear Power Plant works     A nuclear power plant utilizes the energy released by the fission of uranium.     Inside the containment building, which houses a reactor, two steam generators, two reactor coolant pumps and a pressurizer, heat is generated in the reactor core, which in turn heats the primary coolant (water). The heat of the primary coolant is transferred through the steam generator walls to the secondary coolant inside the steam generator, turning the coolant into steam. The steam then drives the turbines. The steam turbines are connected to an electric generator, which produces electricity. The electricity is then delivered to consumers through the power grid, making our jobs easier and improving our quality of life.     The World of Energy \u2013 an interactive multimedia centre that takes visitors on a journey into the world of energy and energy technologies.     eSvet - responsible energy future     eSvet is a web portal highlighting interesting facts on energy and energy technologies to be taken into account when building a responsible energy future.

Artists     Brad Downey     03.06.2020 18:49     Brad Downey (1980, Louisville, Kentucky) can best be described as a conceptual artist and the most famous stranger. Downey, a master of fine arts and sculpture, developed his skills at the Slade School of Art under the mentorship of Bruce McLean. In 1998, at the Pratt Institute's initiative, he decided to continue his life in New York. Downey's projects distort the habits and conventions of the urban environment and cast doubt on norms that are so firmly embedded in society that it perceives them as real and appropriate rather than restrictive and invasive. The lack of discourse and dialogue is a theme that Downey touches in each of his works. These question customs and moral values and encourage viewers to re-evaluate their environment.     He has exhibited at venues such as Tate Modern, the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in the USA, the Kunsthalle Dominikanerkirche in Osnabr\u00fcck, the Kunstcentret Silkeborg Bad in Denmark and others. He also made several free, mass works of art outside the enclosed exhibition space. He has been creating his radical and inspiring works worldwide for the last two decades, and in recent years he has been working mainly in Berlin.     He found himself in Slovenia for the first time almost by accident, after a call from a Ukrainian friend who was interested in coming to Slovenia for a haircut. Downey responded to the invitation and, together with other participants, attended the Fotopub festival in Novo mesto. All of them were a part of the group show with the same hairstyle.     During the exhibition, he got the idea to explore the homeland of Melania Trump, whose work and life he followed from the migrant perspective. Being an American who is no stranger to the European perspective, he felt a responsibility to explore the environment in which she grew up. His idea was carved into a wooden statue of Melania Trump with a chainsaw by Ale\u0161 \u017dupevc - Maxi. It is located near Sevnica.     Melania's copy was exhibited in Berlin and the Ljubljana V\u017eigalica Gallery. The story also received overseas media attention, CNN, and some other media houses. He now wants to add a new kind of cultural value to Melania's work and analyze the depth of artistic creation.     He returned to Slovenia often, most recently before the start of quarantine due to the positive experience. He wanted to stay here only for a few days due to some works of art, which soon turned into months due to the epidemiological situation. Thus, he remained trapped in Slovenia with projects that were already underway and were given a new form. At the same time, the environment of Izola, where he lived, inspired him to such an extent that he managed to create new works and as part of our project residence, collaborating with CO Nanocentar, name: intermedia artist Marko Vivoda, Rok Pahor, and others.     One of the results of the collaboration with the CO Nanocenter is the work Space on a Grain of Sand. The idea was to carve into the smallest unit still suitable for processing, and that was a grain of sand from Santa Barbara, California. With the help of a colleague from the CO Nanocentre Bojan Ambro\u017ei\u010d, using a focused ion beam, they \"carved\" an image from a Sumerian stone tablet on grains of sand. The second project is still ongoing. As part of this, they are restoring important foreign work of art from a layer of a painted wall using X-rays and infrared images.     There are new projects on the horizon, inspired by the community he lived in, artists and friends whom he made new acquaintances with, and created various artistic projects.

I knew it had been done before, but in my mind, while many of the listings had been appropriate, a certain amount of political correctness had crept into the selection process. We had to do something different, the BFS top 100 listing would be based on one thing: the music, and no amount of politicking would push a recording up the ladder even one position. Another consideration was that this listing would be for \"rock\" albums. Not rock and roll, not Motown, not folk, not metal, not jazz, not rap, not the blues, not anything except good old fashioned \"rock\". Granted, excluding other closely related forms of music would keep some of the world's best loved favorites out of this listing. As a result, the likes of Miles Davis, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Stevie Wonder, Joan Baez, Carole King, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Robert Johnson, Count Basie, on and on.... would not be included. Some wonderful performers would, by definition, be casualties of my desire to set parameters and limits on how far this listing could reach. And indeed, I thought the failure to set boundaries was the primary reason the recent listing on VH-1 was a complete failure. And fortunately so... After starting this project two Junes ago, my heart hit the floor when I heard that VH-1 was doing a Best of Rock listing wherein the top 100 rock recordings of all time would be listed. My thunder had been stolen I fretted. How could I come out with this listing after them and not appear to be anything other than a copy cat compiler? As it would happen, however, they did me a great favor by allowing people such as Britney Spears assist in the selection making process, and for the sake of political correctness included noteworthy performers such as Miles Davis and Aretha Franklin, who, as notable as they were, had nothing to do with rock. They have their own categories founded in the blues, jazz, folk and Motown. With classical and country, I hope to someday compile top 100 listings for all the major musical forms, but not here... this is rock. This listing is not a personal pick of my favorite recordings, or the personal favorites of anyone here at BFS. Artistically, I don't care for some of the recordings chosen for inclusion, but included they were, for I consider this effort to be historical in nature, even archival, and objective in that the recordings chosen were chosen for what they meant to the genre' as a whole during it's birth, growth and maturation. In other words, what we are doing here is to report, in a manner as fairly as possible, on the recordings that formed the music which came to be known as rock music. As stated above, you will not see listed here selections from what is known as heavy metal, death metal, black metal and rap. Not that people don't listen to those forms of expression, but as we were talking to people about the recordings to be included here, and obtaining various opinions, I felt that the content of the above were not right for inclusion. The dehumanizing subject matter that is a regular part of heavy metal and rap scene has no place here. And for that matter, rock recordings delving into the satanic or dark beliefs have not been included here either. If those things interest you, go elsewhere. So, how were these recordings chosen? Billboard charts for the last thirty, or so, years were scoured to determine the impact each recording had on the buying market. People in the industry, recording and playback, were consulted and asked for suggestions. Day long listening sessions were conducted to see how the music held up today. And for me, this latter aspect of the selection process was one of the most important. Did the music sound dated? If so, it dropped in rank, which would explain why some of the Beatles and Rolling Stones recordings slipped. As notable as their recordings were, they sound dated in comparison to the recordings listed in front of them. Music is timeless, and to be included here it had better sound that way. Impact. How much did a certain recording impact the music scene at the time it was released? Also considered here, was to what extent the recording reflected the climate of the times. For those reasons alone, Sergeant Pepper's has a place in the top twenty, whereas, if the only criteria were musical accomplishment, it would probably be much lower. Did any recording reflect the rebellious spirit of the young in the late sixties and early seventies more accurately than Woodstock? That's why it is here. Musical accomplishment. For obvious reasons this criteria was the most difficult to apply, while being the most fun to contemplate and debate. And yet, along with whether or not the music retained a contemporary feel to it, the ultra subjective notion of just how \"accomplished\" the music was ultimately determined where a recording ended up on the list. One thing that we tried not to do was allow one good song on an album mean de facto inclusion here just because of that one good song. Initially, I was expecting to include many more albums from the early sixties; Turtles, Boxtops, Hollies, Dave Clark Five... stuff like that. In going over those recordings though, two things emerged: By any standard, the music sounded dated, incredibly so. By my own criteria, that wasn't good, and could not be easily overcome. The other thing that bothered me about many of the early sixties recordings was the preponderance of many to have just one extremely fine song, and seven clunkers to go with it. In some instances, two or three worthy songs would surface, with the rest being so hoaky sounding that I couldn't force myself to include the album. After all, we are looking for consistently excellent results throughout the album... not just a song or two. Another consideration was whether it was thought that another band could have made the same album, and had it come out as good or better than the original band. For example, no one could have made \"Dark Side of the Moon\", with the same mood, art and expression as did Pink Floyd. Could anyone other than the Beatles pulled off \"Sergeant Pepper\"? But that's not always the case even with what are thought to be monumental works of music. Two Stones tunes for example. It is arguable, and I believe true, that Grand Funk's version of \"Gimme Shelter\" is the better of the two. The same for Leon Russel's version of \"Jumping Jack Flash.\" And while those were actual instances of a superior remake, the thinking here was that if it seemed a band's performance in recording an album, as great as it may have been, could have been improved upon by someone else doing the same material, the original sunk. This aspect of consideration didn't really enter into the factoring until well into the list. Lastly, we did on some occasions stretch the envelope style wise where a performer was slightly something other than true rock, but still impacted the future of rock music. Joni Mitchell comes immediately to mind in this regard, as does Tracy Chapman, Peter Gabriel, Linda Ronstadt and Poco. They are here because they deserve to be even if they don't perfectly fit the mold as defined by the word \"rock\".

The electric field distribution in the body is thus very inhomogeneous during the delivery of classical electroporation pulses. Because of the inhomogeneous electric field distribution inside the body, the effects of electroporation-based treatments are also inhomogeneous in the body and thus less effective. Electroporation-based treatments thus require extensive numerical optimizations to cover the entire treatment area with sufficient electric field. At higher pulse frequencies tissues in the body have a smaller impedance range, and recent studies suggest that with shorter high-frequency bipolar electroporation pulses, electroporation of the tissues in the body could be more homogeneous, and that high-frequency electroporation pulses can achieve effective treatment without muscle contraction.     Our group regularly follows the development of commercial and laboratory prototype electroporation devices and we conclude that the first problem arises as there are no suitable electroporation devices for thoroughly analysing the effects of high-frequency electroporation pulses. The second problem arises as some groups independently to high-frequency treatments researchers concluded that high-frequency bipolar electroporation pulses can cause cancellation effect. Therefore we will develop a new prototype electroporation device that will generate high-frequency monopolar, bipolar and asymmetric bipolar electroporation pulses from 100 ns to 1 ms pulse duration, pulse amplitude up to 4 kV, and pulse repetition rate up to 5 MHz. For the first time, we will analyse thoroughly the high-frequency electroporation pulses in vitro as well as in vivo. Current electroporation models for electric field distribution in tissue are stationary and the changing of tissue impedance with the frequency of the pulses is not included. We will develop a new model in frequency domain and include the frequency characteristics of the tissue, and thus more precisely determine the electric field distribution of the high-frequency electroporation pulses in the tissue. Previous studies suggest a presence of cancellation effect in the field of high-frequency electroporation pulses. We will analyse thoroughly the range of electroporation pulse parameters and determine the equivalent parameters of high-frequency electroporation pulses regarding currently used classical electroporation pulses. We will systematically analyse the findings that the high-frequency electroporation pulses distribute in the tissue more homogeneously than classical electroporation pulses by indirect observation of electric field distribution using magnetic resonance imaging, and the findings that at the equivalent high-frequency electroporation pulses do not cause muscle contractions and pain by quantitative evaluation of muscle contractions and unpleasant sensations.     The expected results would significantly influence the development of current electroporation-based treatments because they would improve coverage of the entire treatment area with sufficient electric field. This would most likely increase the efficiency of the treatments, reduce the scattering of the results and simplify the treatment planning. The expected results would also reduce the muscle contraction and excitation of nerves and thus reduce the unpleasant sensations, movement of tissue and electrodes during the treatment, and improve the safety of treatments close to nerves.     Organization of the project is closely linked to the objectives pursued. The principal research institution in the project is the University of Ljubljana (UL), Faculty of Electrical Engineering, one of the leading research institutions in the world in the field of new electroporation devices, modelling electric field distribution and in vitro electroporation experiments. In addition, the principal research institution has prominent experience in analysis of tissue impedance, muscle contractions and unpleasant sensations due to electroporation pulses. The collaborating research institution is the Jozef Stefan Institute (IJS) which is one of the leading research institutions in the world in the field of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of electroporation effects. In the field of the action potential, muscle contractions and unpleasant sensations we will collaborate with dr. Rodney Philip O\u2019Connor acknowledged expert in the field of neurophysiology and neurobiology with whom UL cooperates on bilateral project. Animal work will be performed in collaboration with Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia that has many years of experience with animal work, and with whom UL regularly cooperates. With dr. Rodney Philip O\u2019Connor from \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Mines de Saint-\u00c9tienne, France and with prof. Gregor Ser\u0161a from Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia we have signed a \u00bbletter of intent\u00ab to collaborate in the proposed project. The participating research institutions are complementary and highly competent in theoretical and practical knowledge regarding issues to be investigated.     Effective management of knowledge and exploitation will be assured as well as compliance with provisions of ARRS projects. The project leader is responsible for:     overall management of the project,     preparation of the meetings,     timely execution of tasks defined in WPs and preparation of reports,     timely delivery of all data identified as deliverables, and     control of the budget.     The work on the proposed project will be organised in five work packages (WP):     In Work package 1 of the project, we will develop a new prototype electroporator that will allow systematic analysis of the high-frequency pulses in vitro (WP 3) and in vivo (WP 4; described in WP 1). In Work package 2 of the project we will develop a new frequency-domain electroporation model that will allow calculation of the distribution of the electric field in the inhomogeneous tissue. The tissue model will be built by means of magnetic resonance imaging (WP 4) and validated by in vitro (WP 3) and in vivo experiments (WP 4; described in WP 2). In Work package 3 of the project, we will use the new prototype electroporator developed in WP 1 to systematically analyse in vitro the effect of the high-frequency electroporation pulses on permeabilization, molecular transport, and cell survival. Comparing the results with classical electroporation, we will also define equivalent high-frequency electroporation pulses that will be used in WP 4 (described in WP 3).     In Work package 4 of the project, we will first submit applications to obtain permits for the experiments in WP 4. The application should be submitted at least one year before the planned experiments. In case of complication with one of the application we have 6 months of reserve. After we will obtain the permissions for the experiments and develop the new prototype electroporator in WP 1, we will start with the in vivo experiments. By means of magnetic resonance imaging, we will define the mice leg tissue structure for the numerical model in WP 2, compare the electric field distribution of classical electroporation pulses with equivalent high-frequency electroporation pulses determined in WP 3. Within this work package, we will also determine whether high-frequency electroporation pulses have a less significant effect on muscle contraction and unpleasant sensations compared to classical electroporation pulses. After finishing all the experiments in this project, we will take into account all the results obtained in WP 2, 3 and 4, and define the guidelines for more efficient and less painful electroporation-based treatments (described in WP 4).     In Work package 5 of the project, we will seek the opportunities to protect new knowledge and disseminate results to potential partners in industry. Also, regular meetings and financial reporting to ARRS agency will be organized. By tightening the cooperation between both partners, the project will serve as a base for the preparation of spin-off proposal for international calls, in particular for Horizon 2020 (described in WP 5).

        "text":" Tomo Stani\u010d: On some differences     \u201cIdeas are non-material forms, yet forms are also ideas that have found their material form.\u201d1     I shall establish a defining difference between VSSD and AO \u2013 the diction to \u201cstart from a certain difference\u201d would suggest a far greater discontinuity of artistic practice than the verb \u201cto establish\u201d, which shifts the weight onto the theoretical category. VSSD features scenographic installations, spatial images, total ambiences-installations, Gesamtkunstwerk \u2013 comprehensive artworks that attack the spectator with a broad array of tools from an artistic store room. This is not simply about provoking the eyes and refreshing their sharpness, because one enters these images-ambiences with the entire body; one enters the scent, the time, the sound \u2026 At this point, the difference between the installation-work on the one hand and the document-photography on the other is clearly revealed. Unlike AO\u2019s practice, which I have for the most part had the opportunity to see in person, VSSD only offers photographs of works from catalogues. Some works communicate, expand, polemicize, even come to life through these documents, while others demand presence and an experience, which is why I\u2019ve written \u201cestablish\u201d and not \u201cstart from\u201d.     The reason I insist on the notion of difference lies foremost in the fact that AO\u2019s practice does not present itself as flashy, noisy and luxurious, but is often compressed from a spatial ambience into an object \u2013 elements are not added, but removed and abstracted. Some exhibitions undoubtedly distance themselves from colors and only present white forms-objects, as if picturesqueness stepped back and let form take the stand, even though in a way liveliness and diversity have been preserved through AO\u2019s objects as well. In any case, we are dealing with a shift from a person that comprehensively participates in spatial installations to a spectator who touches the object, establishes an intimate contact with it and observes it, so to speak, on his own, unlike previous spaces that swallowed spectators up. Perhaps we\u2019re dealing with a gesture of delimitation, of drawing a dividing line between VSSD and AO with a new independent artistic practice. It is not my intention to offer this difference as evidence of complete discontinuity or relinquishment, even elimination or repression of a certain practice, even though it often seems that it is not an other author who is behind the most recent practice, but a different one. Some elements resonate in AO\u2019s posterior practice \u2013 as the famous adage goes: \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d In this sense, a common reading is quite interesting \u2013 as a rhyme, reply and objection of one work to the other.     The first difference relates to the spectator and I shall, for the time being, leave that aside and only use it as a springboard \u2026 After all, plenty of ink has already been spilled on the matter. At this point I wish to think one thing and one thing only: objects. I intentionally won\u2019t call them sculptures, installations, plastics or anything similar, not because I would object to it \u2013 they are undoubtedly part of this family \u2013 but because the focal thought of the discussion must take place before all the \u201cart classification rubbish,\u201d if I may use a somewhat provocative term. I am interested in objects before we enter the world of art, before the questions on installation, on the relation between plastic and space, on the distance of observation or touch, and before we label them with the signifier sculpture, installation, piece \u2026 In short, prior to asking the questions that fall within the context of art, I am interested to know why someone creates certain objects, I am interested in the dialogue with objects. AO\u2019s practice is perfect for such an undertaking, and I believe that it is also particularly challenging for thought. It is for this reason that I shall attempt to tackle it at the most abstract level.     One final comment needs to be made before we begin: many of O\u017ebolt\u2019s objects are accompanied by texts. These are not interpretations, but parallels that put artistic objects in a certain context, even though they never reply to it. I wonder whether it makes sense to go through these works in search of a hermeneutic explanation that would uncover the artist\u2019s hidden narrative. In such a case, words would quickly hit a blank wall (sometimes quite literally) or a blank object, even if this has never deterred thought from examining the issue. In no way do I advocate silence or wordless admiration. I believe this is where a new thought is emerging, and if nothing else, at least the desire to enunciate \u2026 Then again, that\u2019s enough, if not too much already.     OBJECTS     Cast: Various things or objects. Author: Martin Heidegger. Subject: To outline the difference between embeddedness and the presence of things in the world. Hypothesis: The primary and most common contact with things (in our case, objects) is not \u201cmere perceptual cognition\u201d,2 but the possibility of handling and using them \u2013 not to observe them but in order to deal with them. In this way a different \u201cknowledge\u201d of the object is constituted, such as could be introduced by an analytic view.3 Heidegger adds: \u201cThis being is not the object of a theoretical \u2018world\u2019-cognition; it is what is used, produced, and so on.\u201d4 It follows that we come to know things foremost by using them, which is why various descriptions of their qualities (such as materiality, dimensions, color) will not get us very far; instead, we must come to know the way in which they are embedded in the world.     This critique aims at the presence of things (Vorhandenheit), which purports to ignore the very essence of things. Things are not \u201cobjectively given\u201d to us \u2013 that is, entirely measurable through their physical qualities \u2013 but are objects that open up and intertwine into a network of relations, purposes, uses, contacts etc. To view an object solely from the standpoint of its qualities would mean that we strip it of all life (use, unexpectedness, relations) \u2013 that is, we distance it from experience, events and changes \u2013 of what is abstracted, ripped away from the context of space and time and tailored or, better yet, subjugated to measurements. This is why Heidegger uses the term useful things or tools (die Zeuge), to further accentuate their use, and then continues: \u201cStrictly speaking, there \u2018is\u2019 no such thing as a useful thing. There always belongs to the being of a useful thing a totality of useful things in which this useful thing can be what it is. A useful thing is essentially \u2018something in order to \u2026\u2019\u201d5 And this \u201cin order to\u201d is a linking element that opens up a reference to other things: a useful thing for writing, viewing, driving etc. Useful things refer to other objects, they establish a relation to them \u2013 to be useful means to be in relation to something, to be for something. A useful object does not close in on itself, but opens up to something \u2013 we never see useful tools on their own, in the same way we never understand them individually first (as a table, light, pen) and only subsequently piece together the living space; on the contrary, they fundamentally reveal themselves as useful things for living, and we only subsequently see a room, table, pen etc. In short, the totality of useful things reveals itself before the individual useful thing.     The next step: not only that a useful thing most authentically expresses itself through relation and use (a hammer through hammering), but a reverse effect is also established, where use itself consciously adapts the tool \u2013 a useful thing originates from handling, a tool adapts itself to work. Hammering with a hammer reveals the handiness of a hammer, which is, in turn, supposedly its very own specific way of being, through which a hammer reveals itself and adapts to it. It is precisely because a tool\u2019s handiness is inscribed in its very essence that we cannot consider it a contingent appendage that is pinned to the tool. A useful thing is at our disposal for a certain use, and its handiness is therefore not conceived as a consequence of interpretation or complementary ability, but of the useful thing\u2019s core, its virtual side so to speak, which is necessarily its component. Useful things are never \u201cmerely present\u201d, whereby we would only subsequently attribute select aspects of use to them.6 What is more, this \u201cin order to\u201d, that is, their purpose or use, is not the only thing that we encounter in useful things, for the manufacturer and user inscribe themselves in them as well. Consequently, useful things mirror the context from which they come and their own relations to the world.     Now we can better understand the struggle against the so-called \u201cobjectivity\u201d and the criticism of the \u201ctheoretical observation\u201d of useful things \u2013 even though we must not sing praises to practice and push theories aside too hastily; practicality is not thought atheoretically. At this point we must not give in to temptation and sever contemplation\u2011thinking from action, for a thought is already part of an action. Just as a practice has its own perception, thought and action, so does a theory. The intention behind Heidegger\u2019s delimitation is hidden foremost in highlighting something special, even seemingly contradictory \u2013 that is, the very fact that a useful thing in its handiness withdraws from being truly present. Withdrawal means that a thing is not present as appearance or a quality, but a useful thing\u2011tool in a way dissipates and merges with work.7 Harman\u2019s example of a bridge speaks volumes: the reality of a bridge is not the amalgamation of asphalt and the steel construction, but the bridging of a gap: \u201cThe bridge is a bridge-effect.\u201d8 A useful thing necessarily resides from itself for something else, it is inevitably in relation to something, even if its use is never actualized. An object\u2011useful thing withdraws from presence in order to become a tool for something \u2013 a task or work come first, and one reaches for a tool only as a consequence of this task. It is worth recalling the famous example of a jug: a jug is made only to provide support to emptiness. A jug is empty for being filled with water. And this leads us to Heidegger\u2019s central division into Zuhanden and Vorhanden, translated as handiness and presence.9     Zuhandenheit is a useful thing-tool\u2019s way of being that makes itself evident foremost through embeddedness and use: \u201cThe act of hammering itself discovers the specific \u2018handiness\u2019 of the hammer.\u201d10 A useful thing is realized, or rather, it comes to itself through being used. What is most important, however, is that a useful thing functions smoothly only when it is practically invisible. What we primarily perceive is a network of automatized functioning, where, if it truly functions, useful things are invisible \u2013 they withdraw from presence to merge without disturbance with the flow of activity. Heidegger\u2019s hypothesis postulates that excessive commitment to \u201cobjective presence\u201d would miss the object\u2019s core \u2013 an explanation of a useful thing\u2019s specific way of being cannot follow from it.     In order to avoid any confusion, I repeat: the world is not given to us as mere presence, we always enter it by way of handiness (Zuhandenheit) \u2013 things appear within our (biased) perception and use. To reach the so-called \u201cobjective\u201d presence we must pass through handiness. Things are therefore \u201cobjectively\u201d given first and it is only with use that they are deformed and reshaped into anthropomorphic tools. Mere presence (Vorhandenheit) means that the process of abstraction has already taken place \u2013 useful things have already been ripped away from the embeddedness of self-evident relations. Vorhandenheit is therefore a thing of factual presence, of categories, measurability and immutable presence. To oversimplify, the difference between zu\u2013 and vor\u2013 is parallel to the difference between relation and substance, or between a useful thing embedded into the network of human use and its supposed independence from man. To lose handiness, however, does not mean to lose legibility; the change is not symbolic, but real. Even though abandoned or useless objects sever some relations they always carry within them the memory of the previous function, they come from a known context, they carry their history with them etc.11 Handiness is never completely lost, it can be brought back to life.     In our case, the composition of the two opposing sides is not as significant as the passage from one to another (from Zuhanden to Vorhanden), which is actually not an outline of a smooth passage but the appearance of some kind of stuttering, faltering or stuckness. Stuttering retroactively reveals the true meaning and operation of handiness: an inappropriate and malfunctioning tool or unsuitability of a material for a certain use only becomes evident because the flow of use is disrupted. Stuttering makes things visible. Only when objects-useful things are taken out of the flow of mutual reference and operation do they acquire a visible presence. A malfunctioned tool therefore does not only change physically (if at all); what changes is the way in which it is embedded, its relations and how it is handled. In other words, the visibility and presence of useful tools implies that something went wrong. Stuttering gives visibility to things, objects catch our eye, they come to a standstill, become noticeable \u2013 the hammer falls from the hand and catches the eye. Heidegger even claims that such objects become disturbing and obtrusive. In such cases, some kind of a fall from the established occurs \u2013 something did not go smoothly or was inappropriate or useless, it lost the\/its right place. He goes on to say that the disturbing, useless and unhandy must be removed or pushed back into action, into handiness \u2013 stifling presence must be eliminated, it must withdraw from visibility once again and merge with a place inside the whole.     We, however, are interested in the exact opposite path, not in the withdrawal within automatic and self\u2011evident work, but in stuttering \u2013 things that are in the way, the excessive things that acquire a visible presence. There\u2019s nothing to be seen in automatized operation. Present objects are useless, but they further burden the spectator with their perceptual characteristics \u2013 they are more present as material objects than they are dispersed in work. These are objects for\u2011nothing, and only as such do they fall from self\u2011evidence and open up to the possibility of a different being and experience. Isn\u2019t presence (Vorhandenheit) therefore much deeper than what is first put to \u201cdirect\u201d use? What Heidegger calls impoverishment of the object, that which supposedly objectifies it the most, is, surprisingly, what enriches it.     \u2026 digression     Heidegger uses the analysis of useful things as the basis for his critique of presence, in which he sees no possibility for a different understanding or interpretation, and points out the fundamental role that handiness plays in man\u2019s being\u2011in\u2011the\u2011world. Graham Harman follows the same reading, only he places the moment of withdrawal outside the human viewpoint. His initial thought in relation to which he wishes to establish delimitation is condensed in the following quote: \u201cWhen I stare at a river, wolf, government, machine, or army, I do not grasp the whole of their reality. This reality slips from view into a perpetually veiled underworld, leaving me with only the most frivolous simulacra of these entities. In short, the phenomenal reality of things for consciousness does not use up their being.\u201d12 More, apparently, is hidden in things than we perceive. Another example: \u201cNo sensual profile of these things will ever exhaust its full reality, which withdraws into the dusk of a shadowy underworld. But if something hides behind the many profiles of apples, what hides from view is not our use of the apple, but rather the apple itself. After all, using a thing distorts its reality no less than making theories about it does.\u201d13 In Harman\u2019s theoretical opus, withdrawal, which was strictly tied to human attachment\u2011relation to the world (as experience, acting and use) in contrast to tedious objectivity (quality, measurability, appearance), acquired serious ontological consequences \u2013 withdrawal or withholding designate inaccessible things that supposedly reside in the \u201chidden underworld\u201d. In short, something truthful \u201cin itself\u201d lies in the darkness, and we do not have direct access to it.14 And the deduction that follows is quite interesting: \u201cThe thing-in-itself escapes us not because we are humans who think, but because we are entities that relate, just like fire relating to cotton or raindrops to a tin roof.\u201d15 It is not simply about the inability to understand, but also about the problem of the one-sidedness of joint effect and practice, both of which fail to grasp a large part of the object itself \u2013 rain touches the roof in a specific way, and its touch is different from that of a fire or a human touch.16 Things do not elude us because we are always biased and limited to anthropomorphism, but because we are necessarily in a relation with them; what reveals itself also conceals itself, observation from one point of view means we miss a different one. Harman takes us one step further: \u201cBut what if we had kept the things-in-themselves and eliminated instead the privilege of the human-world relation over all others?\u201d17 OOO\u2019s epistemological stake is that objects and relations between them are thinkable precisely because they are real, out there, so to speak, even though (and here\u2019s the retroactive punch once again) they are withdrawn and unknowable. This hypothesis is extremely seductive, but somewhat risky, as that which was supressed returns to the surface with each subsequent step: From what position can we make such a statement? How can it be possible to know something external to our register? Harman replies that the unthinkable can only be thought insofar as we think it indirectly by means of an innuendo, allusion or metaphor. He believes that philosophy as well should not use clear language, but \u201cvivid language\u201d. It is contradictory, as Cole points out, that such a philosophical position wants \u201cto decenter the human, but as a language \u2013 and perforce as a way of thinking \u2013 it expands the human into all relations.\u201d18 But what else can we do if we know that any neutrally constructed language will also sooner or later lead to contradictions and coincidences? The latter might actually be the answer: to not move away from language nor limit it, but to go through it in a sense \u2013 that is, by using contradictions, polysemy and coincidences, by crossing the boundaries or conundrums of a language.19 We\u2019ll leave that question open for now\u2026     Allow me to provide another, somewhat more figurative example: \u201cOur use of the floor as \u2018equipment for standing\u2019 makes no contact with the abundance of extra qualities that dogs or mosquitoes might be able to detect.\u201d20 Second thoughts: Where, in fact, is this abundance of qualities located? Would the argumentation change in any way if we substituted the floor with a window and insects that most likely don\u2019t even sense it? To think a window already means to be subordinated to abstraction and separation of a part from the whole, it means to think a unit and unity. Is a window (un)perceived by a fly still a window \u2013 where does it, in fact, begin and end? Is there one window \u2026 does it even have a frame? \u2026 And if the fly\u2019s window is completely different, what is the supposed window \u201cin itself\u201d like? Window glass of course has some real effects \u2013 even if a fly does not see the glass, it will undoubtedly fly right into it (as we often see) \u2013 but what I\u2019m trying to hint at is not that relations or joint effects do not exist, but rather that all these statements tell much more about how we see\/perceive things than they do about how things are \u201cin themselves\u201d. We cannot simply \u201crise above ourselves\u201d as neutral and uninvolved spectators, and henceforth think all flies, floors and, indeed, relations as if they remain completely identical. In this case, consistency would also question the very notion of unity (of the window), consistency of perception, notion of the object etc. I only attempt to address the fact that if we step behind the curtain of humanity, there\u2019s a danger that we\u2019ll be left empty-handed.     Thinking an object is not to be too hastily equated with an idealistic position that cannot really touch an object \u201cout there\u201d, which is also Hartman\u2019s indirect reproach: \u201cToday\u2019s philosophical populace still favors the claim that we cannot think something without thinking it, thereby returning us to an inescapable closed circle of thought.\u201d21 Concealed in this statement are a pre\u2011critical division that posits things as complete out there and a thought that is supposed to simply describe this fully finished out there. There might be no way out of this circle of thought, it might even be closed in a sense, but that does not mean that it is limited, much less transparent to itself \u2013 we do not observe the edges of thought from an all-seeing viewpoint, we stumble upon them. From this standpoint, thought is not\u2011all, it is ridden with antagonisms and ruptures within itself. Without advocating obscurantism, thought can proceed altogether rationally, yet sooner or later it will fold into itself and show its heterogeneity \u2013 thought itself restructures the thinkable. Neither are we dealing with pure coincidences or ramblings, but with necessity, only that this necessity is established retroactively. The problem is therefore reversed, not in the sense that \u201cthere are things that are completely unthinkable\u201d, but that \u201cthe unthinkable itself is thinkable\u201d. After all, thought also cultivates a certain degree of autonomy, a kind of autonomy; this is, in fact, some kind of participation in thought, where we do not know exactly where it will show its limit, fall into paradox or fold into itself \u2013 it is, so to speak, some \u201cit is thought\u201d in which we are not quite versed, nor do we choose it ourselves.     Scientific discourse could also be discussed in parallel with the above and as a reply to Harman\u2019s scepsis: the difference between nature and science that Lacan builds on is not the difference between nature as a completely impermeable and non\u2011transparent thing in itself on the one hand, and an independent scientific discourse as an inventory of nature adapted to humans on the other; to the contrary, science opens a new space of \u201cnature\u201d, where this discourse has real consequences. What is important is that this is not an inventory of nature, but new content that allows us to \u201ctouch\u201d nature, which consequently also means that science not only adds something to reality as such, but even changes it. In this respect, Lacan points out that \u201cscientific discourse was able to bring about the moon landing, where thought becomes witness to a performance of the real\u201d.22     This is precisely why Harman\u2019s realism, which simultaneously constructs a whole universe of things in themselves external to our register and later brings them under a distinctly human conceptual apparatus of interpersonal relations and effects, is not a completely consistent way out of an idealistic position. We need to bear in mind that the very foundation of division (deceiving perception\/real exterior) represents a transcendental precondition that is primarily a product of our comprehension.23 So, how do we move on? By including the ineffectiveness and failures of our own position. In other words, the escape from the predicament of \u201cHow to touch things with words?\u201d is possible precisely through thought-motion itself, both of an object and a notion, for every approach to the supposed being-in-itself will sooner or later reshape it. Slogan: Through the deadlock of an interpretation that is always already an intervention. The position I wish to take is not exactly realism, but an attempt to move the very incommensurability of a pair (of object and notion) through the point where we inscribe ourselves into it. Even if it seems that we observe the world from the outside \u2013 as a permanently foreign spectator \u2013 we do not have a clear, self\u2011transparent view of the enclosed whole of the world, but a view of the inside from within, as a compound in a compound that folds, exceeds and dissolves itself. This means that we ourselves are immersed in the guts of the world and that we have the power to set off its pulse.     Now we can also answer the question of language: it is not about the problem of an innuendo or an allusion to something beyond our thought, but about proceeding through thought to arrive at something that was not thinkable before and that has real consequences. That is why the OOO theory is not reproached for being over\u2011objective, in the sense that the subjective aspect is completely omitted; on the contrary, the problem is that the foundation is set all too subjectively and does not take into consideration inability as the actual division of thought. It\u2019s not that theory does not go far enough; in a sense, it goes too far describing and making presumptions about our knowledge. Why? Because it does not consider the fact that internal inconsistency and contradiction of our knowledge not only means that we are unable to get to what being-in-itself should supposedly be, but it shakes the whole foundation much sooner \u2013 the very constitution of our reality creates what in-itself supposedly is. We must not forget that the very essence of things appears precisely through the disposal of a false appearance \u2013 the essence resides only in the deceptiveness of the appearance of things. What appears in perception itself is the stratification of a phenomenon, which creates some kind of an in front and behind the phenomenon, the possibility of displacement and deception \u2013 nothing is actually concealed, all concealment comes from perception.24 The difficulty is not to project various ideas into the empty beyond, but to understand the emergence of this beyond in the first place. For this reason, movement of thought is possible precisely through self-differentiation of what is perceived, through its layers and even through its self-elimination. It\u2019s therefore not about the substantialisation of this beyond, but about the disparity of the \u201cwithin\u201d.25 In Hegel\u2019s terminology: substance needs to be thought as a subject.     Translation into Heideggerian language: the richness and inexhaustible attributes of handiness (Zuhandenheit) are foremost a retroactive effect of presence (Vorhandenheit). Which would, within the OOO interpretation, read as follows: it\u2019s not about the limitless possibilities of a real object versus final and partial perception, but that infinity of the object is born from stutterings-deadlocks, from becoming present (particularly the ascent of notion as an effect of language). Immense sensual richness of the perceptible is nothing more than the retroactive effect of a word.26 Interestingly, this richness appears as always already lost or absent \u2013 as possibilities that haven\u2019t been exhausted \u2013 which only further confirms that these are merely \u201cword possibilities\u201d. It follows that mere being\u2011in\u2011itself is the effect of a cut and not something that would be limited by both practice and theory; on the contrary, every contact enlivens (opens) and changes the object. A different path is now opening up before us, one that does not think objects as independent of humans, but rather objectness as a product of humans \u2013 and consequently also the reason we incessantly get stuck with (art) objects.     ART OBJECTS     How to think an art object in relation to Heidegger\u2019s handiness and presence? These two are not parallel to recognizability and unrecognizability: recognition implies a thing-object in a certain context, its placement, legibility and purpose; to be unrecognized on the other hand designates objects that we don\u2019t know what to do with, objects that are not in-place or understandable. It seems that art objects move between these two positions, perhaps they even must be recognized in order to truly become unrecognizability or to cause it. This pair is of no help: in a way, art objects are passages from a recognizable structure into an unrecognizable one. They stem from a specific context and often have a certain purpose, and at the same time they are also an attempt to reach for something or open something unrecognizable. Some works take advantage of quick recognizability and self-evidence to strike back and even turn the situation from which they stem upside down.     Let\u2019s give it another try with a different pair: handiness of artworks is often pre-determined and leaves little to coincidence \u2013 the work is created for a certain (gallery) space or the art market and for a chosen public, how the work is to be handled is carefully outlined and often expected, sometimes even the work\u2019s status is ordained. We could claim that a work often enters an automatized mechanism of a cultural context, but that doesn\u2019t get us anywhere. We\u2019re still moving around within handiness and evident use, we\u2019re at the level of the statement that a hammer is made for hammering. The very moment something goes awry and does not run smoothly we enter the terrain of presence, where things are anything but evident and where even a hammer would exit from its self\u2011evidence.     Let us return to the example of a jug, even if it is somewhat misleading. The jug\u2019s emptiness is not all that different from the possibility of hammering with a hammer. The jug opens up a space that is strictly purposeful, much as a hammer opens the possibility to hammer nails and a typewriter the possibility to type. This emptiness, however, is not to be understood as openness, but as relationality, which is a crucial difference. There are objects which cause a different kind of emptiness: 1. Empty space \u2013 openness as the possibility of an interpretation outside the strictly limited useful specter. 2. Out-of-placement \u2013 objects drill a hole in a given context and function as a closure, blockade or unintelligibility. There is a difference between a missing object and a missing place, but we\u2019re nevertheless dealing with disparity and stuttering in both cases. It needs to be stressed that an artwork is not an empty jug that one would fill, but an empty jug full of non-use \u2013 it opens up space that cannot be filled. Something must go wrong, be useless or redundant and bothersome in order to draw attention to itself, and an art object is often a synonym for disparity with itself, a useless object with no right place. It may be true that the majority of objects we deal with are anthropomorphized \u2013 from, for and suited to humans \u2013 they are at hand, or at foot, or whatever, but here we\u2019re not standing before different objects trying to discern the traces of our comprehension and how dependent they are on our view; it is precisely presence (Vorhandenheit) that shows that disruption exists, as does the stuttering of objects, which are created (from and for culture) but always cause some kind of interruption, de-anthropomorphization of the object \u2026 something that causes them to be out-of-place, useless and unhandy. Presence testifies to a disruption, as if it were some kind of a counter-attack on handiness, it is an object and understanding in the making, but first and foremost it is the emergence of misunderstanding. Is it really a coincidence that paintings often had a frame, sculptures a base, galleries a clearly defined set of rules etc.? Are these not means that push handiness away only to outline as much as possible the presence of work and break the ties with the surroundings? Handiness is intentionally pushed away in order to put us before the wall of artistic presence.     Can an artwork even be called a useful thing any longer? Useful for what, exactly? In the case of the jug, the material from which it is made is not even as important as is the fact that it holds and transports water. Which brings us back to the question of a bridge made from matches: Does it really bridge anything? What is its handiness? Is its use or operation not intended (or even withdrawn, withheld) to become and display presence? However, there is some doubt whether this presence is authentic. Is it not merely handiness in disguise that immediately dissipates in the comfort-use of the eye? Nevertheless, it is also true that an artwork hides not only in work as such but is harnessed in an activity. An artwork can be a \u201ctool\u201d for something \u2013 for example to move something, maybe thought \u2013 but only indirectly, through the point of stuttering, of impassability. But \u2013 and this is essential \u2013 an artwork only operates through inoperability. A work does not bridge gaps but breaks connections. The less it is dissipated in use, the more it shows itself and becomes present \u2026 And if it really is a tool, it\u2019s a tool for non\u2011operation.     Stuttering is therefore a point of an unusual passage \u2013 it is a metamorphosis or a transformation. And it is unusual because it designates impassability \u2013 that which gets stuck can no longer move forward, while that which passes is re-created. Something can continue on through its own being-other, through its own dispersal, because it wasn\u2019t able to cross the point of passage. If a concept can truly be comprehended only through some kind of motion (towards itself), then what follows through the work of words or material realization \u2013 through the work being put into the world, being actualized \u2013 is that the (art) object is a condemnation of this same concept. Let me explain: a concept is sharpened through motion \u2013 the sharper it gets the less things stick to it, until the last phase where we finally lose the blade itself and the only thing we are left with is the shape of a cut. In a sense we\u2019re dealing with what appears to be a contradiction: to get to itself, it must abandon itself. That is why it is also not necessary for an examination of a thought to stay in the pre-determined idea. To pass into being-other could therefore be read literally: to pass into some other being, to be re-shaped or dispersed, to be translated into a different thing. A concept or notion has no trouble with inflections through various shapes of thought, or, in fact, through various beings. When an understanding or a conception comes to a halt it simply uses a translation, it can slip into an object, a painterly gesture or musical notation. Why? So that thought can get going, that an object can take it over and push it forward, make a reply and cause undulation and mobilization of thought. A thought is thought in different registers. An art object is a revitalization of thought \u2013 it is something that pushes its own idea forward and is simultaneously a witness to and a place of thought\u2019s stuttering, its (im)passability.     Any object could likely be explained from a human point of view, from the viewpoint of handiness, and it is true that even an art object is created with a certain purpose, with a presupposed problem\u2011idea, from a known material, with a certain context etc. Even though such an object is never fully reducible to the thinkable it is some kind of an object-answer, a break over unthinkableness, where it must transform itself into something else. This means that it replies precisely from a place that understanding or conception cannot reach. A work can come from what is already known and can also re\u2011merge and dissipate into the known, but it always crosses the point of deadlock, it marks the point of presence. This is why it might be somewhat rash to condemn it as a problem of \u201cbeing doomed to the closed circle of thought\u201d or to an \u201canthropocentric view\u201d. We could say that each creation operates as a mirror to humans, with the exception of the very act of installing a mirror. That is why I\u2019m interested in the opposite pole, not the individual object, independent of humans\/perception. I do not attempt to think nor understand this \u201coutside-the-human\u201d, but on the contrary, to think or understand the practice that is strictly related to humans and is at times even very personal, which makes it non-transparent. The struggle for the art object is therefore not about the object communicating a message, but foremost about actualization of thought, about the part beyond the reach of an idea. It is therefore necessary to refute the outpouring of the great author that knows everything and would pour his heart out if only he had a piece of paper \u2026 That is why we must not forget another expression in which Heidegger himself did not see any true potential, which is presence. If handiness denotes motion \u2013 passing inside a network of effect \u2013 then presence is motionless; it denotes the break as a reshaping, a necessary passing into being-other. Presence is the making-present of motion\u2019s stuttering. We don\u2019t need to look for being-in-itself out there when we see that the main deadlock is already \u201cin here\u201d \u2013 in thought and work that are most fully our own. This is why \u017di\u017eek writes: \u201cIt is not enough to insist on the non-transparency of objects, on how objects have a hidden core withdrawn from human reach: what is withdrawn is not just the hidden side of objects but above all the true dimension of the subject\u2019s activity.\u201d27 A change of optics is needed: it is not about the richness of the object in itself that necessarily slips away from the subject of perception, but the excess of the subject itself that is non\u2011transparent to itself and cannot see its own point of inscription in the object. That is why I insist that there is a certain \u201cit is thought\u201d that necessarily inflects, breaks and reshapes itself. An artwork is a presence, it is the torture of object\u2011material in order to give thought a new shape. The conclusion and reply to Harman\u2019s dilemma mentioned above: not only are we always doomed to the closed circle of our thought, we\u2019re not even its masters. And the latter is also the only possible point where works of art can emerge.     REDUNDANT OBJECTS     Another difference between VSSD and AO is hidden in an expression used by the author himself \u2013 so-called redundancy, redundant objects. The expression fragility also appears occasionally. AO\u2019s works do not veil some inability, whether related to material and shape or the negligible and mute, but are instances of intentional uncovering of chosen fragilities. VSSD\u2019s activity was often related to \u201csoft\u201d installations \u2013 to ephemeral spatial installations, unrepeatable installations that only lasted for a single exhibition in a chosen gallery. And even though from this point of view AO\u2019s objects are more enduring, inert and not strictly bound to space, they always provoke some kind of fragility, in some cases even redundancy. What is more, VSSD was in a sense extroverted, energetic and powerful, while with AO we\u2019re seeing marginal, redundant objects, even leftovers. Past practice was created by the Artist and those were Artworks \u2013 this is not meant to be a provocation, but it seems that these works intentionally dealt with the institution of art, its context, genre, and history of art \u2013 and in my view the rest is far more marked with someone that fights objects on their own \u2013 an introverted practice, and objects as leftovers of a life. I believe we\u2019re dealing with an essential shift in the author\u2019s\/artist\u2019s position: VSSD occupies the space within \u201cto know\u2011to know\u201d \u2013 the author knows and the object knows (this, of course, does not mean that there was no tension or fighting involved) \u2013 while the other position could be more easily delineated as between \u201cto notknow\u2011to notknow\u201d \u2013 the artist doesn\u2019t know and neither does his object, which is precisely why AO\u2019s objects are not loud and ostentatious. The difference therefore lies between making a statement and questioning something. In some cases, we can also observe the dichotomy between past works, which employ a motive, and the current works, which build on the so\u2011called missing motive. To be more precise: past practice is programmatic \u2013 it is the projecting of an artistic statement and its deployment, it is about fighting with objects, using them to wag a finger at the world. And AO most definitely is a struggle against objects, each work is a fight, and nobody knows who will come out the winner. VSSD fulfils what was set, realizes what was conceived, while AO is a fall from the initial position \u2013 it is not about approaching a goal, but about moving away from a certain point. Here we\u2019re talking about the split between what is set and what is open, and the difference between the author with his creations, his rights and property on the one hand, and on the other a human lost in their midst (which is the reason letters, self\u2011titled texts, descriptions of meeting oneself exist). The initial practice was created by a life, while in the other life is, so to speak, tailored to artistic work \u2013 that is, life is reshaped through practice and is not \u201creflected\u201d in the work. I believe these differences culminate in, or at least establish a parallel between handiness and presence, between operation and stuttering. It is from these viewpoints that redundancy and fragility must be read. The mentioned objects are not fragile in their materiality; structurally speaking, we\u2019re dealing with the emergence or display of fragility in a certain place.     I\u2019ve mentioned that the author\u2019s notes are always parallels to a certain work. In some cases, they\u2019re even personal stories, as Alen calls them, even if he immediately adds that he doesn\u2019t like those. His objects never illustrate or reflect stories, nor do they narrate them; if anything, we could say that they come from them, just as thoughts or visions come from a given moment in life. And just as a notion truly becomes a notion only when it begins to make a passage or movement, when it moves from within itself and folds into itself, so these objects, their multiplication, accumulation, repetition and collection are always another attempt to formalize something \u2013 they are formalizations of a deadlock (sometimes even of divergence, struggle or searching for one\u2019s own place). If we observe them a little more meticulously we also sense that they are a kind of attempt to stop, which is created and launched on special places \u2013 they are stutterings of time, of cultural changes, technology. AO\u2019s works are not an attempt to answer these deadlocks but to make their places present. "

        "text":" TRUBAR FOUNDATION \u2013 DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS IS MARCH 1ST 2018!     The Trubar Foundation is a joint venture of Slovene Writers\u2019 Association, Slovenian PEN and the Center for Slovenian Literature. The financial means for its activities are provided by the Slovenian Book Agency of the Republic of Slovenia and by other sources. The aim of the Trubar Foundation is to subsidy publications of Slovenian literature in translation.     Application for funds Foreign publishers are required to provide the entire edition for which they received financial support from the Trubar Foundation with an inscription stating that the book was published with the aid of the Foundation. The inscription should read as follows:     This book was published with the support of Trubar Foundation at the Slovene Writers\u2019 Association, Ljubljana, Slovenia. Ta knjiga je bila objavljena s pomo\u010djo Trubarjevega sklada pri Dru\u0161tvu slovenskih pisateljev, Ljubljana, Slovenija.     English language can be replaced by the language of the edition. Immediately upon publication the publisher should send to the Foundation ten (10) copies of the book, along with two original copies of an invoice (signed and sealed) in exactly the approved amount. The Trubar Foundation will forward a certain number of copies to the National and University Library in Ljubljana.     Time limits The Board consists of seven equal members including the Presidents of Slovene Writers\u2019 Association and Slovene PEN. They convene at least twice a year, usually in March and October. Therefore, applications received by the end of February and the end of September will promptly be dealt with. The book selected by the Board is to be published in twelve months following the date of the written notice informing the publisher of the Board\u2019s decision. Should the publisher publish the book after the expired term, a new application is required.     Address for applications: Slovene Writers\u2019 Association for the Trubar Foundation Tom\u0161i\u010deva 12 SI \u2013 1000 Ljubljana Slovenia email: dsp@drustvo-dsp.si, agata.simenc@drustvo-dsp.si     Financial terms Foreign publishers can apply for subsidies to publish translations of Slovenian authors in their native languages. Works that have not been published in the target language before the year of application are taken into cosideration. Trubar Foundation contributes up to 50% of printing costs. It does not subsidy translation; translators can apply for translation grants directly to the Slovenian Book Agency. The application should include the title of the book, name of the author, name of the translator, length in pages, number of copies and the planned date of publication. Publishers should also prepare a financial estimate of all costs associated with publication: copyright, royalties, layout, paper, printing, binding. The application should be accompanied by the publisher\u2019s latest catalogue. Priority is given to the works of living authors who are already established in Slovenia. However, the Board will take all applications for works of fiction, poetry, drama and essays on literature into account, as long as they are originally written in Slovenian.     The Board advises applicants to submit their applications in Slovenian or English, in written form, by regular mail or by email. "

It is one of the limiting factors for plant growth, which is why monitoring the water content in the field is particularly important in agriculture. In this article we present the methods currently used to measure the soil water content. We have described their functional principles, advantages, disadvantages and possible applications. Due to their widespread use in agriculture, we have focused on dielectric sensors, which are classified as electromagnetic methods. We have investigated the influence of soil properties on measurements with dielectric sensors and described possible methods for soil-specific calibration. In agriculture and environmental sciences, measurements of soil water content are particularly important for irrigation management. Irrigation based on measurements enables us to optimize the use of water resources and reduce the negative impact on the environment. For the correct functioning of such sensors it is necessary to check the suitability of the factory calibration function. Special attention is required when installing the sensors, as the presence of air gaps causes errors in the measurements.     Bayer, A., Mahbub, I., Chappell, M., Ruter, J., & van Iersel, M. W.

Archival article     The Revija 2000 went out of print in 2010. See below the archival article. Dru\u0161tvo 2000 (\"Association 2000\") was established in 1969 by a group of students who adhered to personalistic philosophy and principles of social movements. The group initially focused on the publication of Revija 2000 journal and later began organising symposia, lectures, and discussions. In collaboration with Cankarjev dom Culture and Congress Centre, round table discussions on current social topics have been held.     In addition to having published Revija 2000 for 40 years, the association is active in publishing basic literature related to personalistic philosophy and social, political and national issues written by Slovene authors, such as Tine Hribar, and foreign ones. They have launched numerous literary works, including diaries and letters by Ivan Mrak and poetry by Josip Osti, as well as an anthology on aboriginal poetry and a collection of papers on Edvard Kocbek. Some of the foreign authors included in their publishing programme have been: Martin Buber, Simone Weil, Talal Hadi, and Gibran Khalil Gibran. New titles are usually complemented by presentations and press conferences, and available in most major bookstores in Slovenia. Their website features short descriptions of their books.     Culture.si offers information on Slovene cultural producers, venues, festivals and support services, all in one place. It encourages international cultural exchange in the fields of arts, culture and heritage. The portal and its content is owned and funded by the Ministry of Culture and developed by Ljudmila Art and Science Laboratory. "

With precise 3D scanning of the original and creation of functional CAD model we provided them with data for production of replacement.     The customer has presumed problems with excessive warpage in the stage of tool design. The material is PA66 with 30% of glass fibers. With the help of advanced injection moulding analysis we predicted the trend and values of warpage and thus successfully eliminated the problems.     Our client has planned a single phase deep drawing process for the presented case, however several doubts about manufacturability arose. The conducted analysis has cleared all doubts.     We made a comparative study between experimentaly and numerically determined strength of a fibre reinforced product, which yielded extremely good match of the results from both methods. "

The most recent oil paintings continue to adhere to the same artistic interpretation of the specific, sometimes even closed, perceptual world, even though, over time, muscles and skirt have subtly covered the framework. The dynamic figures remain typified and affect us as distant and asexual despite the soft approach and warm incarnate depiction. If we look fur help among the representational patterns of general iconography, the sym-bolic language of rare forms and allegories can explain the artist's apparent, perhaps illogical love of the forms that are less often encountered, and then usually only as attributes in certain traditional collocations. It is not difficult to establish that the focus of Vozelj's interest in the human body, without denying the psychological factor, is the physical and material side of the body, its ability to move and its endeavours to dominate space, which is distinctly abstract, artificial and shows no tendency to simulate depth in his paintings. As a rule, figures escape from or into the picture in vigorous leaps, bends and turns, so that they occasionally strike us as depicting the elegant motion of sportsmen. We probably cannot assign to them ritual gestures that could be implied by similar postures, but this manner of depiction can be safely related to the symbolic tendency towards freedom that transcends the everyday course of life, to nonconformism and motion, to disruption of the statics, and hence progression. The interpretation of the meaning of the bones, which are mistakenly understood only as the metaphor of death and evil, is rather unifirm in various iconographic models. Being the constructional element of the body, the bone is its basic and therefore inevitable part, hence the symbol of firmness and strength, and the primeval element of being. From this arises a belief in the indestructibility of the bone, it's durability and regenerative capacity, thanks to which a being as a complex creature is immortal, but only in this form.\" "

General     The protection chamber for weighing OK is designed for safe handling of dangerous pharmaceutical substances, mainly for laboratory weighing of small quantities and preparation of samples for analyses. The suction chamber with horizontal, laminar filter-directed air flow prevents the passage of material from the chamber into the environment and thus protects the operator and the environment. It is a precise weighing, sampling, filtration or any operation with open, especially highly active substances.     Working principle     The suction chamber works on 100% air exchange (the amount entering also exits the system - without recirculation). The chamber takes air from the surrounding area - the laboratory (from the front through the working aperture).     The air enters the workplace of the suction chamber from the front through the working aperture, using a fan mounted in the suction unit. The captured air then travels over the workplace and the first filtration quality H14 (EN 1822). Through outlet filters, the incoming air, which is contaminated with the substance within the working place, filters and purifies. The filtered air then returns to the place.     The first output HEPA filter quality H14 is installed directly behind the workplace. It is safe to replace the first output filters that are loaded with dangerous particles. The second output HEPA filter quality H14 is integrated into the suction unit and provides additional protection and assumes the role of air filtration in the event of a change or damage to the first or the other. the first two output filters. Through outlet filters, the incoming air, which is contaminated with the substance within the workplace, filters and purifies. The filtered air then returns to the place.

Lovers of good wine even at that time liked to taste Mu\u0161katni Silvanec, as they used to call Sauvignon, though Furlanski Tokaj was familiar to them, too. Among old varieties the most popular were Stajerska Belina and Rumeni Plavec. Later also La\u0161ki Rizling, and Zamet was among the red ones. Amons vineyard lies among these magical and colourful hills, and Traminec can also be found.

We produce products that satisfy all segments of customers in a quality and affordable manner. We achieve success through the balanced development of our own brands, while environmentally friendly products and happy customers are the foundation of our business.     Customer care     In our day and age, which is full of stress and people leading a more sedentary lifestyle, our beverages represent an excellent form of relaxation and a healthy way of life. There is a growing number of Slovenian and foreign customers who are enjoying our natural mineral water, delicious juices and selected brandies. At Dana, we devote every working day to customers and enhancing their satisfaction.     Quality management system     We introduced and certified the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system in the year 2000.     The safety and suitability of processes from production to sale     International standards for verifying the quality and safety of products     The IFS (International Food Standard) is an international standard for evaluating suppliers in the food processing industry.     Daily laboratory control     Dana's products are carefully controlled at an in-house laboratory on a daily basis, and are also checked by several authorised external institutions and independent researchers.     Tradition spanning over more than 60 years     1952 - 1970     Began producing a strong alcoholic beverage     The Company was founded in 1952 when the People's Committee of Mirna issued a decision formally registering a labour organisation, which was first entered into the register under the name of Dana on 1 July 1955. During the first years of the Company's development, the product line included alcoholic beverages. Liqueurs produced on the basis of medicinal herbs were a big sales hit (Hermelika, Kralj Samo, Gorjan, etc.). In 1967, the Company launched Frutella, a refreshing carbonated drink. The recognisable orange flavour made it extremely popular with children and young people.     1970 \u2013 1987     Expanding production to include non-alcoholic beverages     In the period following 1970, the Company transitioned from craft to industrial production. Significant resources were invested into production capacity and the construction of a new distillery. The production line expanded to include fruit juices and other various non-alcoholic drinks; the Company also started producing large quantities of fruit distillates, concentrates and aromas. In the period leading up to 1987, sales of \"Zlati Sok\" (Golden Juice) were very good. The nectar made from home-grown fruit, berries and beetroot was bottled into glass bottles and Doypack packaging. Among Dana's alcoholic beverages produced in the 70s, Cynar was especially popular. The 80s were the golden age of emulsion liqueurs like Scotchcream, CocoBrasil and \u010cokolada, fruit liqueurs like Kivi, Chery and Marakuja and Jack&Jill whiskey.     1987 \u2013 2005     Complete focus on non-alcoholic beverages     During the period between 1987 and 2005, the Company focused entirely on non-alcoholic beverages. The Company launched an iced tea, the River carbonated drink and the Multi Dan non-carbonated drink range. Advances in technology enabled the introduction of the hot filling process on an aseptic filling line using Variopak laminated packaging; later, a cold filling process for Dan nectars using Combibloc packaging was also introduced.     After 2005     Water \u2013 the flagship product     Over the last few years, we have begun adapting our marketing efforts to the modern consumer who is interested in nature and a healthy lifestyle. By following the strictest quality standards and recognising our customers' needs, we have become a modern factory that not only bottles the best water owing to nature-given quality and modern processes but also produces juices and spirits. We continually adapt to market changes and choose innovative marketing tools, because market communication with end users is a key issue in the present atmosphere of ever increasing competition and with the growing offer of different products.

Preden smo pri\u0161li na kon\u010dno destinacijo, smo naredili postanek v Se\u010dovljah, kjer smo si ogledali muzej solin. Prijazen vodi\u010d nam je povedal vse skrivnosti o nastajanju soli, prav tako pa nam pokazal kako so solinarji \u017eiveli v\u010dasih.     Po prihodu v Zambratijo, je najprej sledilo kosilo, nato pa smo se odpravili do te\u017eko pri\u010dakovanega skoka v morje. Seveda smo se prej ustavili \u0161e na zaslu\u017eenem sladoledu in se posladkali. Mmmmm, bil je zelo dober. Sledil je preizkus plavanja, nato pa so nas u\u010ditelji razdelili v skupine. Ker smo imeli po ve\u010derji \u0161e kar precej energije, smo se odpravili na kraj\u0161i sprehod, kjer smo se nau\u010dili himno \u0161ole v naravi z naslovom \u00bbSedem zamor\u010dkov\u00ab, nato se pa nasmejali ob \u0161alah, ki so jih u\u010denci pripovedovali na obali.

Therapy sessions are 50 minutes and usually scheduled once weekly. The duration of therapy is ultimately up to you.

        "text":" Atlas software application is an editorial production tool providing automatic and simplified management of all types of data in the printing environment. It is designed to enble editors and journalists to edit, create and monitor newspaper pages through pre-set templates.     Moreover, Atlas is a web-based system which means that programme users can manage their sections anytime and anywhere; from a reporting location or a nearby restaurant, holiday resort or a home sofa. The automated workflow management speeds up the production process, reduces the production costs and the number of people involved in the process, especially when managing repetitive contents and different versions of the publication.     TV programme schedule management     A special Atlas feature is a programming module that automatically creates and edits TV guide contents, and thus simplifies and shortens the management process. Further, it converts a variety of file formats (.txt, .rtf, .xls, or imported text file formats) into a uniform editing document. In addition, it automatically puts forward previously edited and translated material, ready for printing. The converted, customized and edited files are exported into Adobe InDesign system. TV programme creation involves the use of a page layout template into which database information is integrated for an unlimited number of versions. The user thus creates the size of an article and determines its location in a magazine or newspaper.     Atlas is constructed of three independent units:     The user interface for databases editing (photos, graphics, texts, broadcasts \u2026)     The user interface for data integration into a pre-set template     The user interface for document layout information editing     Databases     Atlas is a database-driven system which means that various independent yet connected databases are in operation behind the system offering users access to all types of data: photos, graphics, TV broadcasts, information on personalities, publications, stories, ads, and any other digital documents. Databases store all digital material and history of all events, further reduce the possibility of repetitive publishing, provide exchange of information among editorial offices and thus keep track of all changes being made in the system.     Atlas databases are a flexible tool offering unlimited enhacement possibilities, moreover, data can be exported in multiple content formats.     What does Atlas do?     Converts and customizes the data received into uniform centralized data for automated integration into a document layout.     It facilitates automatic processing and editing with Adobe InDesign CS programming system pagination applications.     Translated texts are stored in databases and are automatically put forward at frequently performed tasks (in case of a series, repeats ....).     Stores different content files (photos, broadcast contents information, information on actors, people ...).     Provides full contents tracking.     All tasks and actions during the publication process are entered in log files.     Facilitates columns editing (TV programme, articles, editorials ...) with a possibility of an output preview.     All reports are user friendly.     Advantages offered by Atlas software solution:     The editor has full control over the document layout and onscreen preview of each record made by operators into a layout template.     The editor has constant control over the entire workflow process already performed and work in progress.     It allows editors to work on different versions of the publication at the same time.     An authorized person (reader \/ editor) is allowed to lock the page and thus prevent unauthorized access.     TV broadcast description is based on the selection from previously assigned graphic elements (title, subtitle, text, signature, photos ...)     It provides columns editing (TV programme, articles, editorials ...) with a possibility of an output preview.     It reduces the occurence of grammatical errors (spell checking feature, selection of proofread material from the database)     It provides easy and fast training.     STOP Magazine \u2014 a Modernized Editorial Office     In December 2005, Atlas editing system was sucessfully integrated into the production of the Stop magazine, Slovenian weekly magazine with the most comprehensive TV guide. The trial period operation has shown that the use of Atlas produces savings in about six months which are increasing up to 30-40 percent per year (according to present costs). First savings can however only be seen after databases are filled with graphic and demographic material. These are merely calculations, moreover, it has to be emphasized that Stop magazine has been, since the introduction of Atlas software application, producing a TV guide version extended by 50 percent, with a more precise data and more graphic elements (19) as before (9), all during the same time span.     With the user in mind, the system is easy to use, and requires only a short, low budget training. The system keeps track of all production processes which is one of its main advantages that will shorten working processes. The use of Atlas system greatly cuts down the costs of graphics processing, having these stored in a database for future use. The introduction of an internet connection and a virtual editorial office will further reduce costs and thus result in lower expenditure for the use of business offices.     The production of different publication versions will enable Stop magazine to also create TV guides for outside customers and thus increase this additional advantage     User's statement     While searching the market for a software solution designed to provide the most efficient automated creation of a TV guide, no suitable product was found. A decision was made to assign a development of such a solution to the Slovenian experts. Since the beginning of its functioning, Atlas system has proved to be a fast and a reliable programme performing without any interruptions. A new, extended TV guide has been set up with Atlas system in a shorter period of time than the previous one and with the same number of employees\u00ab said Martin Senica, Stop magazine editor. Stop, with its 66 TV programmes, is the most complete TV guide in Slovenia, which also means the most complex TV guide management.

        "text":" Barbara Ku\u017enik: Climate change is our number one enemy     \u201cIf you invest two Euros in a bike, you get five in return,\u201d says Karl Reiter, Austrian environmentalist and expert in transport and mobility. He is convinced that investing in cycling means lower healthcare costs, reduced road congestion and faster public transport. It may even save the future.     During European mobility week, as is appropriate, after more than twenty years I actually tried out a new bicycle. And so, on a rainy and windy car-free day, I tried to set a good example to my six-year-old daughter, and we both ended up constantly having to get out of the way, mostly of cars. Some people just do not care. I can understand them, because in reality there are many people who on this particular day only pretend to care.     Days dedicated to this or that are mere gestures \u2013 take part in it and everything will be forgiven! And when these days are over, we go back to our bad habits with no guilty conscience, use extremely wasteful electrical devices, burn tens of litres of petrol, drive obsessively to the closest shop and back, waste too much water, buy without restraint and too much. And finally, besides the other filth we produce every year, every Slovene throws away around 86 kilograms of rubbish, much of that food.     And then we are surprised by the weather, floods and terrible forecasts for the future.     In the past, people have often fought for a better future: against occupying forces, authoritarian rulers, misguided systems and fictitious enemies. Last weekend, the streets of metropolises like London, New York, Berlin and Brussels, as well as Ljubljana, were full of protesters who wanted to encourage world leaders to start a more determined fight against climate change.     Climate change is today the world\u2019s number one enemy. That the voice coming from the streets should be listened to and considered was mentioned even by American President Barrack Obama on Tuesday, when he gave a speech to high representatives at the United Nations Climate Summit. The fact that this summit would not bring any dramatic changes was expected. But fortunately, Leonardo DiCaprio, the newly appointed UN Messenger for Peace, in thespian style made some painful points, among them that he pretends for a living but that the present leaders of the world do not. Obama added, in a similarly dramatic tone, that we are the first generation to face the consequences of global warming and the last generation who can do something about it. This is of course all true, but where does climate change actually come from?     For the last twenty years, climatologists, meteorologists, ecologists and other scientists have been pointing out that people have managed to change the planet more in the last fifty years than they did during many past centuries. After the industrial revolution, everything developed with the speed of light, but rapid technological progress also has a dark side. While today one part of the world enjoys accumulating material goods and lives in an ivory tower of blind security, the other part of the world is going through rough times. Because of drought, war, oil, water\u2026     The Earth is calling for help. Greenhouse gases are causing global warming, melting ice in the Arctic and consequently changing the sea level and temperature. As early as the 2050s, we might see new mass emigration from flooded areas. We will be faced not only with a great ecological but also with an unimaginable humanitarian crisis. If there are no significant changes.     After a decade of applying measures to reduce the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, introducing renewable energy sources and encouraging energy efficiency, the level of carbon dioxide emissions is still increasing. Environmentalists are concerned that we might not be able to keep the global temperature increase under two degrees. Under pressure from the public and industrial lobbies politicians accept compromises that bring problem-solving efforts to a standstill. And at every downpour, people become extremely frightened because it is said that worse is yet to come.     In the European Union, climate change is discussed in all areas, but despite the fact that this topic will be a priority for a number of years, there is no particular department dedicated solely to this issue. In the new European Commission, two interdisciplinary related fields (energy and climate change) were merged into one in order to facilitate logistics and in the hope of reducing disagreement. But its stated priorities are not approved by everybody, including the Green 10, a group of the leading European nongovernmental environmental organisations, who wrote a letter to Jean-Claude Juncker criticising the new European Commission structure, which does not comply with Europe\u2019s obligations to fight climate change. They are concerned about the fact that the priority of the new Commission will be the Energy Union. The definition of this is not yet completely clear, but it is likely that the vice-president of the European Commission for the Energy Union will also or in particular have to deal with the issue of climate change.     No matter what the structure of the Commission is, in Brussels, everything revolves around climate change and the new energy policy. These are some of the goals to achieve by the end of this decade: reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990, produce 20% of energy from renewable sources and improve energy efficiency by 20%. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 40%, if we want to reduce them by at least 80% by 2050. Will we have then won?     Unfortunately, these ambitious goals are not everything. In the plans for 2030 (which will supposedly be discussed at the EU summit in October), one of the most important goals for Europe is to gain energy independence as soon as possible. Some of the EU members depend on Russian gas and in these troubled times, anything can happen. But none of us can even imagine what the world will be like then. For that reason we have to become independent and ensure safe, stable and \u2013 lest we forget \u2013 above all, green energy.     A few days ago I completed a survey in the newspaper European Voice. My answer to the question as to whether energy security should be higher on the EU priority list than the goal of reducing emissions by 2030 was of course negative. It is imperative to first reduce greenhouse gas emissions! I think globally.     But we should also act locally. An exchange economy, complete waste recycling, car sharing, the local production of fruit and vegetables, better and more efficient public transport, solar and wind energy. There are so many little things that everyone can start doing today, instead of waiting for the miracle that is predicted for the next Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015.     Changes are already taking place. Not only concerning the climate, but also changes in the way we think and act. The internet offers a selection of alternatives. Join them while you still have electricity.     Can we today even defeat climate change without the internet?

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

The partnership is based on the general awareness that sustainable development is most dependent on cooperation and human resources development.     Project description:     Toolmaking is one of the key strategic branches of the Slovenian economy. In fact without the appropriate industrial tools, it would be impossible to produce small, medium and large serial products. Slovenian tool shops in Europe and worldwide are recognized as one of the best suppliers of the most demanding tools and dies to global OEMs with.. Toolmaking is also essential for the operations of other production companies, since 80% of exports are also indirectly strengthening other areas of the economy. However, toolmaking is faced with a constant lack of human resources and development challenges.     The KOR project is focused on developing the key competences of toolmaking personnel and brings together 16 key sector enterprises. The partnership is based on the general awareness that sustainable development is most dependent on cooperation and human resources development.     The main objective of the partnership is to establish a generally useful competence model in which competences of the key employee profiles will be defined together with paths for their further development and acquirement of the new competences of the future. Further contributions of KOR will be implementation of numerous joint, internal and individual employee training with recognized Slovenian and foreign leading experts in the field of soft skills as well as in the specific technical fields. Trainings will include all key employee profiles: management (leadership), production managers, developers, technologists and tool makers, with a purpose of personal development, leadership competences and acquiring of new specific knowledge in the field of strategic directions of the branch, new development tools, technologies and Industry 4.0 guidelines.     The main goal of the partnership is to include 981 different people in training which in total will achieve at least 1283 inclusions by attending different training sessions.     In addition to the implementation of training, the objective of the successful implementation of the KOR project is to increase cooperation and recognition of the toolmaking sector and whilst at the same time establishing sustainable foundations for further support of the human resources development, innovation and development capacities. In order to multiply the effects of the project results and findings will be shared by all other sectorial enterprises and stakeholders from the other industries as well.     TECOS role:     TECOS is the financial and administrative project leader and assures high quality implementation of the technical, administrative and content activities for the whole partnership. Coordination includes content coordination, financial management, internal and external training coordination, active procurement of offers from external trainers, assuring high quality preparation and implementation of competence models, collaboration of enterprises and the promotion and representation of toolmakers\u2019 interests on both the national and the international level.     Sample Project     The client had to renew a wore down rotor with knife segments for which they didn't have any documentation. With precise 3D scanning of the original and creation of functional CAD model we provided them with data for production of replacement.     The customer has presumed problems with excessive warpage in the stage of tool design. The material is PA66 with 30% of glass fibers. With the help of advanced injection moulding analysis we predicted the trend and values of warpage and thus successfully eliminated the problems.     Our client has planned a single phase deep drawing process for the presented case, however several doubts about manufacturability arose. The conducted analysis has cleared all doubts.     We made a comparative study between experimentaly and numerically determined strength of a fibre reinforced product, which yielded extremely good match of the results from both methods. "

        "text":" About me     The beginnings of my familiarisation with glass are in 1999 when I had the first opportunity to observe the production of traditional stained glass. I remember being taken over by glass as a material and the medium to the extent I decided to embark on a quest to discover and explore its and my options.     The first years were marked by production of a variety of spatial forms and glazing in the Tiffany technique and classic stained glass. I have always been fascinated by tinted glass in appropriate spatial placement because of its speech at different times of the day, the play of light and shadow and colour shade overflow. Due to curiosity, enthusiasm and creative energy, I was soon oriented towards glass melting, which now remains my main interest.     Glass melting or fusion takes place in an oven at high temperatures, thus offering unlimited possibilities for experimenting with form and colour. Also other glass treatment techniques may be used, i.e. cold treatment, casting, pate de verre technique, elements of Murano glass.     In my view, glass resembles to a living organism and speaks in its own specific strange and challenging language and often conducts in a specific manner, which for me is a constant challenge.     Maja Zaplotnik     Critique     Design concept by Maja Zaplotnik is an original and sophisticated. Viewer is provided with dynamic visual experiences and content that is discreetly derivative and translated into a simple yet sophisticated and effective translucent whole. Artist\u2019s works provide to the Slovenian space new expressive dimensions and values that are in the context of contemporary glass design quite rare, namely spatial light entities, ideally connecting technical expertise with a rich creative imagination. The author successfully upgrades the basic functionality of objects with specific aesthetic elements and colour accents that semantically and formally change the basic character of glass surfaces and layers. Glassware of Maja Zaplotnik includes paintings, sculptures, reliefs and lighting fixtures, in short thoroughbred artistic organisms that do not impose strict boundaries between artistic media. Her sculptural-design space installation are spontaneous and dynamic, \"existent\" beyond the standard definition of style and genre, but this is far from meaning that her motif contexts are not implemented consistently in harmony with the primary idea. Artist's abstract vision through the prism of glass of objectivity is unusual both in terms of design as well as implementation aspects. So we are dealing with a well-researched visual language that preserves the playful narrative, aesthetic and fluid-structural poetics of light relations. The most common theme of this specific art nature is the nature with luxury of its forms; an important factor is also dreams as well as wide variety impressions. We are faced with the newly defined world, self-contained designed and completed with a rich symbolism. The artist is looking for new meanings, transcendence and integrity. Her fine art reveals multisignification, sometimes emotionally subtle, sometimes violent and surprising. She speaks to us in an exciting, stylish and very distinctive artistic approach that can be perceived one way or another, depending on our mood. "

Manual editing to reposition vertices in the grid to obtain orthogonal layout in plane.     Manual editing in 3D to get orthogonal embeddings in space: minimal, symmetric and cube.     Graph B     Analyzing graph B using our program MODEL we obtained (almost) regular partition in 3 classes. The third class contains only vertex Harmony Central. The second class, represented by squares, contains 11 vertices that are connected only to the vertices in the class 1 (represented by circles). Vertices in class 1 are also connected to other vertices in the same class. We first draw all vertices in the class 1 in the center and vertices in class 2 separately -- using class shrinking and circular drawing options in Pajek. Afterward we manually moved vertices of class 1 connected to only one vertex of class 2 close to this vertex. Finally we manually arranged the remaining vertices of class 1.     We transformed given similarities s on arcs to dissimilarities d = 1 \/(1 + s) and applied Ward's hierarchical clustering method to the obtained dissimilarity matrix. We produced a clustering into 12 clusters, shrank the graph using Pajek, and draw the obtained skeleton minimizing the number of crossings. Finally we manually arranged the vertices of original graph.     Batagelj V., Doreian P., Ferligoj A.: An Optimizational Approach to Regular Equivalence. Social Networks 14(1992), 121-135.

        "text":" Opis: We have performed a systematic study of dependence of time-resolved photocurrent on the point of charge excitation within the organic semiconductor channel formed by two coplanar metal electrodes. The results confirm that spatial variation of electric field between the electrodes crucially determines transport of photogenerated charge carriers through the organic layer. Time-of-flight measurements of photocurrent demonstrate that the transit time of photogenerated charge carrier packets drifting between the two electrodes decreases with increasing travelling distance. Such counterintuitive result cannot be reconciled with the spatial distribution of electric field between coplanar electrodes, alone. It is also in contrast to expected role of space-charge screening of external electric field. Supported by Monte Carlo simulations of hopping transport in disordered organic semiconductor layer, we submit that the space-charge screens the external electric field and captures slower charge carriers from the photogenerated charge carrier packet. The remaining faster carriers, exhibit velocity distribution with significantly higher mean value and shorter transit time.

Using the IP address and cookies to control duplicate entries     Non-list based web surveys do not enable unique identifiers, which would enable us to control duplicate entries. Therefore, we have two alternatives, IP address and cookies, however each with certain limitations.     IP address     IP address is a number assigned to all devices logged into the network, including the respondent\u2019s device. 1KA application enables you to block duplication of IP addresses, which can prevent that the same person repeatedly responds to your survey.     This functionality can be accessed under the 'EDIT' - 'Settings' - 'Respondent access' tab. In the \u2018Block repeated IP address' category select the desired option - the block can be set to minutes - at least 10, 20 or up to 60 minutes, or to hours - for 12 or 24 hours (this option is off by default).     Limitation: The problem may occur in the case of dynamic IP addresses (dynamic IP address for the same device is changed when disconnected and restored) or in cases where the number of devices on the same network has the same IP address (eg. in organizations).     Despite these limitations, the use of IP blockage may prevent at least some of the simpler frauds like fake responses or server attacks coming from a single device.     Cookies     Cookie is asmall text file sent from the server hosting the web questionnaire, and then stored on respondent devices. Next time the respondent visits this same web questionnaire, the 1KA application recognizes this unit, which can be used to prevent repeated access or to enable proper continuation from eventual pausing or breakoff.     1KA application enables a variety of options in terms of cookies, which can be also accessed through the 'EDIT' - 'Settings' - 'Respondent Access':     'until the end of questionnaire', means that the cookie is deleted as soon as the respondent finishes answering the survey;     'Until the end of the browser session', the cookie is stored for the duration of the browser session (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera), i.e. also after the survey is completed and is deleted when respondent closes the browser;     'for 1 hour': the cookie is saved for one hour after the respondent first clicked on the survey URL;     'for 1 month': the cookie is saved for one month after the respondent first clicked on the survey URL.     You can find more about cookie settings and options for future continuation of the survey fulfilment in the Settings for respondent access: cookies and passwords manual.     Limitation: The problem with cookies is that they are tied to the browser, which means that respondent using another browser, other devices or user deleting the cookie can complete the survey again. Cookies face serious problems due to increasing ethical and legal restrictions, as well as because some users decide to block them. For these reasons cookies serve poorly as a replacement for the ID code.     In general we do not recommend using IPs and cookies for restricting access to the survey, because they can cause various expected and unexpected problems. In the default settings of 1KA application are these options usually turned off. Still, in some specific situations they can be useful, particularly if we know that in our target population none of the above problems emerge. "

        "text":" O projektu     My name is Bostjan Skrlj and my dream is to travel the world, crisscrossing as many countries as possible on my bike, a BMW GS 1200 Adventure. In August 2008 I left my home in Slovenia and set out on this journey. With no timeline, traveling overland on new and ancient roads, my trail unfolds daily ...     Bye bye Yukon and welcome to Alaska :) road between two Border was a disaster... if no one takes care of it...     Million deep holes covered with black ice, very easy to turn shine side down :) But studs have done their work !!!!     After a long ride first stop in Tok...camping overnight at -29.8\u00baC -21.64F     I had to be careful about Caribo and moose ...I have met a lot of them     The roads were covered with ice and snow as I expected...     Glacier     My friend Bob and Sharon Peek gave me a place to stay and place where i can work on my bike in Wasilla     Oil change for low temperature     0W-40 this oil is still liquid at -50 \u00baC -58F and engine start much easier     something for show :)     Screwing some extra studs for better traction...     is very nice to know someone who can help and support you...     the last check... Please note I do not use any heated clothing.     And here we go !!!!!     Prudhoe here we come !!!!!!     Wasilla - Fairbanks     I always try to find power to plug in my bike when camping     Beginning of Dalton Highway. Alaska State Troopers followed me for awhile to see if I was able to handle icy roads     very nice road for begin     The road are continually changing in surface texture. Had to be aware and focused at all times.     No mistakes allowed.     Arctic Circle... 310 mils to Prudhoe     Unwinding after a days travel with very interesting book from my friend (Miran Juvan\u010di\u010d)     From this point on the road is sprayed to make it smother for trucks     We're have left the boreal forest and moving up across the tundra     The nature is amazing so quite and beautiful cant explain with any words     The temperature is getting colder and road is a little rougher     Slowly making progress further north.     In February the days are still very short in the arctic     Everything that is electric is starting to shutdown, indicator on dashboard, GPS, temperature sensor.     Extremely cold, imagine what the windchill was. Thank goodness I had a better helmet this trip     Finally Deadhorse -31*     Low temperature makes everything very fragile, and we can lose some piece of equipment very easy     this is just the beginning     The life of working in Prudhoe, everything is plugged in and left running al night long.     Trucks are running 24\/7     Drilling Rig Base     Heating up machines to get them to run.     I prepared my bike for this expedition, I'm going to write a separate report on what I did to make this ride     a sucess     My bike has more then 10,000Km on extreme conditions and I expected this to happen. The shock has     more then 90,000 since the beginning of my trip.     In the beginning I was traveling with one other person and we carried a lot more luggage. On very rough     roads. The Ohlins did a great job for me , no complaints     This much oil dropped on the ground in Prudhoe could get a fine and a ticket, I found this out later.     I'm at the halfway point on this trip and only have part of my suspension working. Have to be very     careful going back     Because your are not able to camp in Deadhorse I had to use the hotel, but the price was not out of line     Because they gave you the meals at no additional cost. You can eat like a pig. HaHa     Bike started without any problem, thanks to good planning     General store in Deadhorse Alaska inside the have a wall of heros (pictures of people who have     driven motorcycles up here) But not that many in winter.     This is as far as a person is able to go on the North Slope of Alaska. The rest of the area is private property     and leased by the oil companies.     Cross wind 35-40 Mph the way back.     The weather looks a lot better a little further down the road.     Me and my best friend     Pump Station three, moving the oil down to Valdez Alaska.

        "text":" Renovation of information system     Abstract     The thesis deals with the process of renovating and upgrading the existing information system of the Islamic Community in the Republic of Slovenia. It involves analysing, planning and developing the necessary changes in the system. To this end, the majority of work was performed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and the C# programming language. Moreover, the thesis presents other tools, technologies and methods that contributed to the renovation and upgrading of the system. The Islamic Community opted for the renovation because they encountered difficulties in the existing system. They were also interested in raising the level of data security, add new functionalities and introduce a mobile application. The thesis provides a detailed insight into the first renovation phase, which includes the renovation of the system back-end and a section of system upgrade that is visible to the user.     Item Type:     Thesis (EngD thesis)     Keywords:     information system renovation, system back-end, database "

For the deminishing generations of survivors\u2019 sakes it is the duty of present generations and the historiography to prevent memory loss about one of the darkest sides of 20th century history.     Despite the small size of the Slovenian territory where Jews before and after World War II were relatively few in number, the Slovenian Holocaust history can be, and it actually must be described as a microcosmos of Holocaust history within Central Europe. Remembering the Holocaust and the tragedy of genocide should not just be the remembrance of the victims but also of those who have survived the greatest tragedy from the first half of the 20th century. The Center of Jewish Cultural Heritage Synagogue Maribor, being the national coordinator of programmes in the field of Holocaust education and remembrance, annually dedicates special attention precisely to these issues. For the fourth year now, abundant activities and a variety of events across Slovenia are being organized under the title \u201cShoah \u2013 Let Us Remember\u201d. For it should not to be forgotten\u2026     You are cordially invited to attend the events that will be held between 3rd and 31st January 2013:     - openings of the exhibitions: Anne Frank \u2013 a History for Today; Star Stripe \u2013 An Exhibition about the Holocaust; Tracing Jewish Heritage in Slovenia; Being Jewish; Holocaust 1933-1945 (Courage to Remember); Eternal Memory (The Holocaust Remembrance Day); Forgive Us, Forgive Us, Oh You Dead! Jewish Soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Isonzo Front;     - scientific meeting Each Year One Name: Unknown Slovenian Righteous from Prekmurje and Primorska Regions and round table on the topic Ciril Kotnik \u2013 the Next Righteous Among the Nations from Slovenia?;     - interview with Slavko Goldstein, presentation of the book Jews in Slovenia: History and the Holocaust, and lectures: Shadows of the Memory \u2013 Extermination of the Jewish Community in Prekmurje Region; Marko Rosner \u2013 The Forgotten man from Maribor; Images of the Death: Nazism and the Holocaust through the Eyes of the Art; Teaching about the Holocaust \u2013 The Pedagogical Philosophy of Yad Vashem; Forgotten Heroism at the So\u010da River.     Honorary patron of the project Shoah \u2013 Let Us Remember 2013 is Mr Karl Erjavec, the minister for foreign affairs of the Republic of Slovenia. The project was realized with the financial support of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance \u2013 IHRA. "

In 1968 the family bought an abandoned farmhouse and 0.1 hectares of vineyard, and produced our first sparkling wine using the traditional method, naming it after our daughter Barbara.     With an annual production of around 200,000 bottles, Isteni\u010d is the leading house in Bizeljsko in terms of volume and quality, and one of the leading houses in Slovenia.     We built a winery at Pir\u0161enbreg in 1995, surrounded by three hectares of beautiful young vineyard. This increased our area under vine. The vineyard has plantings of whites chardonnay, beli pinot, and sivi pinot, and red modri pinot.     In November 2006 we bought three hectares of vineyards in Drenovec, the best site in Bizeljsko. Here chardonnay, la\u0161ki rizling and \u0161ipon all flourish. At the heart of the vineyard is a winery that was completely renovated by the Isteni\u010d family in 2007. It is used to raise 500 hectolitres of the best wines for making sparkling wines. "

Most often, documents are delivered to us electronically and we also accept documents sent by post or fax. Once the translation text is finalised and the file completed, we email it back to the client or send it by fax or post.     Notarised and certified translation     Notarised (also referred to as certified, official, court or sworn) translations are documents prepared in paper form which are stamped with the official seal of the certified translator. The original document, its translated version and the translator\u2019s statement on accuracy and correctness of the translated text are bound together with the Slovenian national string and sealed at the back. This gives the translation a status of an official document. Such certification is legally valid and permitted only by a translator, sworn-in by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Slovenia. Sarah Cooper, the head of Cooper Translations holds such certification powers. When do you require a notarised translation?     Once the translation document is certified we most often send it to the client via post or express delivery. Often such certified translations are required to be filed with a particular government office or a regulative body in Slovenia in which case we can provide filing service as well.     Free translation     If you have a document in Slovenian and do not know what it is, we are happy to tell you its title and the brief content for free!

        "text":" TECAR therapy     The term TECAR is an acronym for Capacitive and Resistive Energy Transfer. The use of TECAR technology is of major importance in rehabilitation therapies since it reduces pain, stimulates venous drainage in the lymphatic system, significantly reduces both muscular and back pain. In general, TECAR is used to treat disorders such as sprains, tendonitis, bursitis, osteoarticular distractions, chronic arthralgias, contractures, strains and muscular tears, myositis, pathologies of joint capsules, arthritic processes, lumbago and sciatica. Therapy is widely useful for treating all types of sports injuries. The TECAR method represents a technological innovation in the field of energy transfer in the diseased parts of the organism. From the other treatments that use the electromagnetic waves (ex. the ultrasound and the laser) the TECAR method is differentiated by the typology of the transmission of energy. In fact, TECAR therapy is not based on the induction of heat \"from the outside\", but rather on the stimulation of ionic charges naturally present in our muscular tissues through the application of particular electrodes. This involves a process of intensive stimulation of the tissues at the cellular level, which activate the blood circulation inducing an increase in temperature that accelerates a natural physiological reaction. TECAR therefore does not make use of the electric transmission from the outside, but involves the exchange of the electrolytes already present in the organism at the cellular level, with the aim of reactivating the circulation. Therefore, the process induces an increase in temperature in tissues that triggers the natural reaction of the organism, which is essential for the restoration of a considerable number of muscle and joint damage. This happens thanks to the combination of two mechanisms: increase of temperature in the deeper tissues and increase of the energy potential of cell membranes.     Thanks to the thermal effects (heating of the tissue), therapeutic therapy is often combined with manual therapy or passive stretching, where, due to local hyperthermia, a wider range of movement and faster muscle relaxation are obtained, while isometric muscle contraction stimulates the influence on the activation of individual muscle fibers. The TECAR therapy is a very pleasant treatment, since it involves an optimal feeling of heat, and which one can undergo with absolute tranquility since it does not cause collateral effects.     However, treatment is considered contraindicated for women during pregnancy, for individuals with pacemakers, as well as for neoplastic patients and for patients with a disturbed temperature detection.     reduces pain     improves superficial and deep blood circulation     improves tissue regeneration "

You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

        "text":" Nahajate se tukaj     \u0160OU threatens to suspend R\u0160 funding     On its evening meeting on December 30th, 2020 the newly elected Student Assembly of the Student organisation of the University of Ljubljana (\u0160OU) discussed the 2021 draft budget which no longer includes co-financing of Radio Student (R\u0160). The Assembly had recently changed the rules relating to \u0160OU\u2019s financing which in their new version do not even provide for the minimum percentage as regards the concession fees-based financing of the activities of the institutes of the Student organisation family.     It is worth noting that during the epidemic Radio \u0160tudent took great efforts in adapting to new circumstances and managed to successfully complete all ongoing projects and even enhance the programme, including special media coverage of the covid-19 pandemic. Even so Radio \u0160tudent was put in a disadvantaged position and pulled the shortest straw in 2020 compared with the other members of the Student organisation family. The financial support has been diminishing for almost a decade; the amount of 230 000 EUR earmarked for the Radio in 2012 grew gradually smaller with the result that last year R\u0160 received only 120 000 EUR of financial support for its regular activities. We can assume that with the draft budget proposed by \u0160OU at the very end of 2020 the future prospects for Radio \u0160tudent will be very grim, much grimmer than those of all the other members of the \u0160OU family, although R\u0160 was not the only one that suffered disproportionately.     \u0160OU\u2019s draft budget for 2021 which went through first reading in the Student Assembly is almost 3 000 000 EUR. The most striking disproportion concerns the Student campus, which according to this proposal will be allocated 325 000 EUR from the concession fees in 2021. It is our conviction that we are not the only ones interested in knowing what activities are planned in the Student campus this year and what they have been doing since the start of the epidemic considering that they radically reduced their activities, which Radio \u0160tudent did not.     We are also convinced that the disproportionally low funding that R\u0160 received from \u0160OU last year has been put to better use than the millions spent for salaries, meeting fees and closed \u0160OU institutes. We therefore demand that our radio station is allocated at least 120 000 EUR in 2021 which would be proportionate with the budget that has been understandably reduced due to the pandemic. We are also in favour of maintaining the minimum rates of funding for the institutes of the \u0160OU family. Furthermore we demand that Radio \u0160tudent is included in all the discussions regarding its uncertain future.     Radio \u0160tudent is faced with a survival challenge which is unprecedented in the 50-year history of this institute that has been playing an important and unique media, educational and cultural role, also at the European level, and which at the moment employs more than 200 young part time co-workers, who create 17 hours of live programme daily. Radio \u0160tudent\u2019s resiliency in carrying out its educational mission is proved by 50 new colleagues that join us every year. The actuality of this activism is corroborated by the record number of young people enrolled in R\u0160 auditions at the end of last year (about 200 students enrolled in training in editorial departments and editorial services at R\u0160). An above average number of currently renowned academics, scientists, businessmen, politicians gained their experience at R\u0160; today active successful presenters, radio and TV anchors, cultural producers and managers made their bones at R\u0160. Last but not least our editor Zarja Mur\u0161i\u010d received an award by the Slovenia Journalist Association for outstanding journalistic achievements in her covering of the covid-19 epidemic. Or, if we borrow the words of the renowned Slovenian radio presenter Jure Longyka from last autumn: \u201cRadio \u0160tudent is an achievement of civilization. To lose it would be a defeat of civilization.\u201d     Duhovito, ampak \u0161e zmerja zgolj spust po istem toboganu nekoga, ki zna napleteni\u010diti nekaj \u0161e kar duhovitih stavkov, ki pa samo dokazujejo, da je s     Zanima me naslov komada.

        "text":" Memory Laws: Legal Regulation of Historical Interpretations     One-day workshop     Friday, 13 October 2017     Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (Institute of Culture and Memory Studies), Ljubljana     Abstract submission deadline: 15 May 2017     Notification of acceptance: 15 June 2017     More than a century after the Armenian genocide, it is still difficult to write about it, because one might be severely challenged: in Turkey, for insisting on presenting it as a policy of extermination; in France, for failing to do so. This is just one result of what Richard Evans and Henry Rousso call the \u201cjudicialization of history\u201d (Evans 2002; Rousso 2002). After the tide of legislation prohibiting denial of the Holocaust and other crimes, which peaked in the 1990s (Kahn 2004), it is time to evaluate the intended and unintended ramifications of its application and its potential effects on historical memory. In addition, the last twenty years have seen a rise in legislation that indirectly influences social memory by regulating the production, accessibility and dissemination of information about the past (Savelsberg & King 2007), the most prominent example being the laws that regulate access to archives.     The relationship between collective memory and law has been dominated by the paradigm of transitional justice and the debate on whether legal trials influence how societies remember crimes from the past (Osiel 2000; Douglas 2001). On the one hand, the discipline of transitional justice examines collective memory only in relation to the ideals of peace, reconciliation and dealing with the past (Barahona de Brito 2010). On the other hand, research on the example of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia demonstrated the limitations of the court\u2019s ability to shape collective memories in the region (Gordy 2013; Risti\u0107 2014). However, these issues do not exhaust all aspects of the relation between law and memory, leaving under-researched the phenomenon of \u201cmemory laws\u201d - any legal act regulating the interpretation of the past, whether by recognition, sanction or evaluation. This special issue invites more nuanced attention to be paid to the ability of legislation to determine the parameters of admissible and preferred historical accounts.     Memory laws are an important aspect of the state-sanctioned politics of memory, selecting and shaping interpretations of past events and promoting specific views of history in the form of both legal acts and their implementation in the courtroom. Furthermore, laws that seemingly do not fall within this category may actually act as memory laws (e.g. laws regulating veterans\u2019 pensions). Memory laws can even be abused for other purposes, such as eliminating the political opposition. Finally, national legislation related to historical memory, including governmental and parliamentary declarations and resolutions, is often shaped under the influence of international trends, or used as a tool in international relations. In this sense, international declarations, such as the European Parliament Resolution on European Conscience and Totalitarianism, not only influence the emergence of similar documents in national contexts, they also produce travelling concepts that are appropriated, transformed and used as arguments in political debates related to national memory cultures. This relation between the national and the international level is reciprocal, because it is often states that lobby for the acknowledgment of their past through an international declaration in the first place.     We welcome papers on topics related to the following:     - Legislation criminalizing genocide denial in local political contexts     - Use and\/or misuse of genocide-related legislation     - Recognition of genocide in third countries (e.g. the Armenian genocide in French, German and other contexts; third-country recognition of the Great Famine in Ukraine as a genocide or a crime against humanity)     - Political uses of the post-communist memory laws     - National appropriations of the European Parliament Resolution on European Conscience and Totalitarianism     - Historical revisionism through legislation     - Legal aspects of historical revisionism     - Laws on rehabilitation and restitution as memory laws     - Parliamentary declarations on remembrance from a transnational comparative perspective     - Theoretical contributions discussing the relation between memory and law     We especially welcome contributions that step outside the Eurocentric perspective and\/or approach transnational dimension.     Selected papers are will be published in a special issue of a renowned journal.     Organiser will provide affordable accommodation.     Please submit proposals for papers in the form of a 500-word abstract with a short biography to jovana@zrc-sazu.si AND jelena.dureinovic@geschichte.uni.giessen.de.

        "text":" The France Stele Institute of Art History is the central scientific research institution for art history in Slovenia which conducts research into fine arts and architecture from the Middle Ages to the mid-20th century, including the study, publishing, and commenting on archival sources for their historiography and interpretation. As one of the 17 institutes of the Scientific Research Centre at the Slovene Academy of Science and Arts (ZRC-SAZU), the Institute of Art History also maintains a library and documentation on Slovene art monuments and artists.     Contents     History     Originally founded in 1972 as the Section of Art History at the Institute of History, this institution was renamed in 1975 as the France Stele Institute of Art History after its first head, the leading Slovene art historian of the time and academician Dr. France Stele (1886\u20131972). He was a pioneer of Slovene art heritage protection and a leading conservator of monuments formed his doctrine of protection under the influence of the Vienna School of Art History, Alois Riegl and his mentor Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.     Programme     Special studies are dedicated to the art of the Romanesque and Baroque periods and of the 19th century, and to the work of architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik. The results of the researches also contribute to the preservation of artistic monuments, which represent essential components of Slovene national identity. Special attention is paid to exceptional individuals such as Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, Toma\u017e Hren, and Francesco Robba.     Library and publications     The institute's library includes some 15,000 works relating to art history and is part of the ZRC-SAZU central library. Information on recent acquisitions is accessible through the COBISS computer system, and older publications are catalogued in alphabetical files. The institute has topographic and personal card files of Slovene art monuments and artists, and a collection of photographs and slides. These are constantly being expanded with new information and research findings. Research results are published as scientific papers in the institute's own journal and other periodicals and in monographs, with emphasis laid on Baroque sculpture and painting.     The central scientific publication of the institute is the annual Acta Historiae Artis Slovenica. Current reviews of publications, exhibitions, interviews with art historians and artists is published in the quarterly Art Chronicle Bulletin that was launched in 2003.     In 2013 the publication Le sang et le lait dans l\u2019imaginaire m\u00e9di\u00e9val [Blood and Milk in the Medieval Imagery] by Jure Miku\u017e was published online in French language (cf. link below).     Collaboration     The institute collaborates with Slovene and foreign experts as well as with galleries, museums, heritage conservation organisations and art history institutes, both in Slovenia and abroad (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, and Hungary).     In collaboration with SAUR Allgemeines K\u00fcnstlerlexikon (AKL) the Institute of Art History collected a database of 3,688 artists that were active in Slovenia throughout history until the early-20th century. It is also a backbone for bibliographic and biographic encyclopaedia of artists working in Slovenia in the past.     Since 2014 the Institute has taken part in the EU project Women's Creativity since the Modern Movement (MoMoWo) that highlights the diverse contributions of women in design professions. The Institute closely collaborated with the Center for Architecture Slovenia.

It was organised by the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts; the Universities of Ljubljana, Zagreb, Graz, and Warsaw; Central European University (CEU); International Network of Excellence \u201cEuropa Renascens\u201d; DANUBIUS Project (Universit\u00e9 de Lille); and the Institut des Sources chr\u00e9tiennes.     Proceedings are being published in scientific journals Bogoslovni vestnik, Zgodovinski \u010dasopis, Clotho and as a monograph at the eminent publisher Brepols.     Presentation     Hieronyme, veni foras, \u201cJerome, come out,\u201d Jerome himself wrote in his letter to a friend (Ep. 4), stating a personal desire addressed to God. His own call provided the starting point of the international scholarly symposium in 2019, commemorating the 1600th anniversary of Jerome\u2019s death. The encounter highlighted recent research trends related to Jerome\u2019s life, to his opus, and to the reception of this ancient ascetic, Biblical scholar, biographer, traveller, epistolographer, theologian, exegete, satirist, and controversialist. The meeting took place in Ljubljana, Slovenia, among the archaeological sites of Roman Emona from his letters (Ep. 11\u201312), whose genius loci remains influenced by the proximity of Jerome\u2019s birthplace, Stridon. While the exact whereabouts of Stridon remain unknown, an excursion was offered by symposium\u2019s organizers in order to discuss some of its potential locations. The conference was interdisciplinary and presented Jerome in the light of the latest discoveries; its particular focus were the archaeological finds of Christian Emona from 2018. The papers invited considered \u2013 but were not limited to \u2013 researching Jerome within the framework of historical context, archaeology, biblical exegesis, patristics, classical philology, and theology.

        "text":" It is one of the oldest inhabitants of the Earth. It connects the past and the future. It is a source of life. (That's why, perhaps, a tree used to be planted near every house with a newborn.) It personifies or offers a dwelling to the spirit. It inspires with its beauty; it gives us the sense of harmony and unity with nature, society, and the super-natural. (That's why, perhaps, the saying goes that when we cut a tree we also cut our memory, or dissolve the space.) Trees form part of our precious ancestral heritage. We must preserve them, exalt them and hand them over to our descendants. Our attitude to trees and nature is an important part of our culture.     In Slovenia, a tree-labyrinth is far less known than a hedge-labyrinth \u2013 but still more known than a stone-labyrinth. After visiting possible sites and consulting with relevant experts (landscape architects and planners, botanists, gardeners, and representatives of collaborating parties), the decision was reached: it will be a Canadian hemlock (Tsuga canadensis).     Did you know?     Tsuga canadensis belongs to conifers in the family of Pinaceae; the genus is widespread in North America and Eastern Asia.     Canadian Hemlock \u2013 The Facts     Canadian hemlock is an evergreen three autochthonous to the eastern regions of North America. It grows everywhere from Alabama and Georgia to the Great Lakes. It was brought to the Old Continent \u2013 or to Great Britain, to be precise \u2013 as late as 1736. Nowadays it is frequent throughout the Western and Central Europe, primarily as a park tree.     Canadian hemlock, an evergreen tree with short, flattened needles and small cones, is nowadays found primarily in parks and tree plantations. It grows individually or in groups. Young trees are easily trimmed and shaped; therefore they are frequently planted in lines forming hedges. The hemlock tree grows a thick crown offering shelter from wind, snow, and sun. It is resistant to freezing; it thrives on fertile and humid soil, on locations not very exposed to sun.     Normally it grows up to 15 metres high and its pyramidal crown reaches between 4 and 8 metresin diameter. Its branches grow in an irregular shape of a spindle; its needles are up to 1.5 centimetres long, soft, obtuse, wider at the bottom and narrower towards the top. Its cones ripen in the first year, grow up to 3 centimetres, but remain closed almost for a year; the scales are ovoid, grey-brownish, indistinctly serrated. The seeds are yellowish.     Canadian hemlock is not unknown in Slovenia. For example: - It was planted in the Maribor city park at the 100th birth anniversary of Olympic winner Leon \u0160tukelj; - It can be seen in the Ljubljana University Botanic Gardens, and along the Jesenko's Path on the Ro\u017enik Hill;     - It grows in the Vol\u010dji Potok Arboretum.     Did you know?     In Canada, they have recorded adult hemlocks growing as high as twenty-one metres, with the diameter up to one metre, and more than 800 years old.     Hemlock forests are popular habitats of different wild animals and birds, e.g. grouses, and they frequently offer winter shelters to deer.     Canadian hemlock \u2013 The Uses     Indians, native inhabitants of North America, used hemlock twigs to make ceremonial tea and steam baths. Hemlock bark tea was used in treating cold, fever, diarrhoea, stomach problems, even scurvy. The bark was also used as a poultice to stop bleeding.     The hemlock bark contains a lot of tannin, so the early white settlers were using it the leather industry, while the hemlock wood was used for sleepers at railway tracks.     Nowadays, the hemlock wood has little commercial value; it is used for heating, in construction and \u2013 since it is unaffected by temperature differences \u2013 for private home saunas.     Did you know?     Especially in the USA, its etheric oil is used as a fragrance in air fresheners, domestic detergents, soaps, gels and other chemical and cosmetic products. "

        "text":" Overview     Overview     Introduction     Accurate analysis of the spine and spinal structures from medical images is an essential tool in many clinical applications of spinal imaging. Knowledge of the detailed shape of individual vertebrae can considerably aid early diagnosis, surgical planning and follow-up assessment of a number of spinal pathologies, such as degenerative disorders, spinal deformities, trauma and tumors, as well as for the evaluation of vertebral fractures. Segmentation and classification of fractured vertebrae by computer-assisted techniques may therefore provide additional support to diagnosis and treatment of vertebral fractures.     The goal of the computational challenge on Segmentation and Classification of Fractured Vertebrae () is to bring together researchers who are interested in the spinal imaging and image analysis, validate the performance of their existing or newly developed algorithms on the same standard database of images with vertebral fractures, and provide a standardized evaluation framework for segmentation and classification results comparison and ranking.     Vertebral Fractures     Vertebral Fractures     A vertebral fracture is observed as a collapse of the vertebra that occurs due to conditions such as osteoporosis, excessive pressure, or trauma. Radiography of the thoracolumbar spine is the standard imaging approach for evaluating vertebral fractures in clinical practice, however, visual interpretation of vertebral body deformations from two-dimensional (2D) radiographic images is a challenging task due to the projective nature of images and variability in the shape of both normal and pathologically deformed vertebral bodies. Vertebral fractures are therefore often undetected by clinicians or under-diagnosed by radiologists. As both over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis may have clinically serious consequences for individual subjects, radiologists have to be well-trained and with long-term clinical experience to provide a successful visual interpretation and correct diagnosis of vertebral body deformations. To reduce the subjectivity in interpretation and improve the agreement among observers, quantitative morphometry (QM) and semiquantitative (SQ) methods were proposed and extended to computerized evaluation of vertebral fractures, often supported by image processing and analysis techniques. On the other hand, by generating detailed 3D images of the anatomy, computed tomography (CT) provides means for accurate measurement of vertebral deformations in three dimensions (3D). Segmentation of fractured vertebrae in 3D may provide additional support to surgical treatment of vertebral fractures, for example, to measure the volume of the vertebral body in the case of vertebroplasty, while the detection and classification of vertebral fractures may provide support to clinical practice, and to research and understanding of vertebral fractures. Although the application in 3D may not compensate for additional costs and patient exposure to ionizing radiation in the case of CT imaging, the benefits of an accurate diagnosis outweigh the associated risks, and CT imaging of the spine is frequently performed to accurately measure bone density in the spine and predict whether vertebral fractures are likely to occur in patients who are at risk of osteoporosis.     Evaluation of Vertebral Fractures     To evaluate vertebral fractures, quantitative morphometry (QM) methods were designed that [1-4] apply the standard six-point vertebral morphometry to sagittal radiographic images, which consists of manual placement of six points on the corners of vertebral bodies and at the centers of vertebral endplates. From these points, the anterior, central and posterior vertebral body heights are measured and used to calculate the anterior-to-posterior, central-to-posterior and posterior-to-posterior-adjacent height ratios (the latter is calculated if the posterior height of the superior- or inferior-adjacent vertebral body is available). To distinguish vertebral fractures from various deformations that normally occur in healthy subjects, the obtained heights and height ratios are then compared to their normative values. Despite the relatively objective nature of QM methods, manual measurement of vertebral body heights is time-consuming, and even a relatively small measurement imprecision may have a considerable impact on the classification of vertebral body deformations. In clinical practice, radiologists prefer visual estimation of the loss in vertebral body heights over manual measurement of vertebral body heights. As a result, the semiquantitative (SQ) method of Genant et al. [5], which introduced specific morphological cases and grades of vertebral body fractures, is accepted as the \u201cground truth\u201d for the evaluation of vertebral fractures. By estimating the anterior, central and posterior height of the vertebral body in sagittal radiographic images, the SQ method defines the following morphological cases of vertebral fractures:     Wedge     The wedge (anterior) morphological case of vertebral fractures is characterized by a distinctive difference between the anterior and posterior vertebral height.     Biconcavity     The biconcavity (middle) morphological case of vertebral fractures is characterized by similar anterior and posterior but a smaller central vertebral height.     Crush     The crush (posterior) morphological case of vertebral fractures is characterized by the mean vertebral height lower than the statistical value for that vertebra or for adjacent vertebral bodies.     Moreover, the SQ method defines the following morphological grades of vertebral fractures:     Mild     The mild (1) morphological grade of vertebral fractures is characterized by a 20\u201325% reduction in the vertebral height.     Moderate     The moderate (2) morphological grade of vertebral fractures is characterized by a 25\u201340% reduction in the vertebral height.     Severe     The severe (3) morphological grade of vertebral fractures is characterized by an over 40% reduction in the vertebral height.     Crush case (3) [posterior]     Mild grade (1) [20% - 25%]     The Challenge     In the past decade, computational challenges have become an integral part of the medical imaging community, and regularly organized events within the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention - MICCAI and International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging - ISBI conferences.     Computational challenges in the field of spine medical image analysis have already been successfully organized within the dedicated annual MICCAI satellite event. The 2nd MICCAI Workshop & Challenge on Computational Methods and Clinical Applications for Spine Imaging - MICCAI-CSI2014 hosted two challenges on \u201cSpine and Vertebrae Segmentation\u201d and \u201cVertebrae Localization and Identification\u201d, and the 3rd MICCAI Workshop & Challenge on Computational Methods and Clinical Applications for Spine Imaging - MICCAI-CSI2015 hosted two challenges on \u201cAutomatic Vertebral Fracture Analysis and Identification from VFA by DXA\u201d and \u201cAutomatic Intervertebral Disc Localization and Segmentation from 3D T2 MRI Data\u201d.     The challenge builds on the two previous challenges, \u201cSpine and Vertebrae Segmentation\u201d from MICCAI-CSI2014 and \u201cAutomatic Vertebral Fracture Analysis and Identification from VFA by DXA\u201d from MICCAI-CSI2015. However, while the former challenge targeted healthy vertebrae in CT images and the latter challenge targeted fractured vertebrae in DXA images, the challenge can be considered as successor of these two challenges as it targets fractured vertebrae in CT images. The goal of the challenge is therefore to:     bring together researchers who are interested in spinal imaging and image analysis, especially in vertebra segmentation and fracture classification problems,     validate the performance of their existing or newly developed algorithms on the same standard database of clinical images with vertebral fractures,     provide a standardized evaluation framework for vertebra segmentation and fracture classification results comparison and ranking.     The challenge is supported by the SpineWeb, an online collaborative platform for everyone interested in research on spinal imaging and image analysis, and registered with the Grand Challenges in biomedical image analysis.

        "text":" You probably have been willing to hum lovely melodies by J.S. Bach. Music, with or without words moves us deeply. Join us and enjoy the beauty of pure melodies.     About the project     Two recorder players Julia Andres and Yeuntae Jung founded in 2012 the Ensemble Nexus Baroque with the aim of making music from baroque era audible in new ways. As it's name Nexus [lat. connection] says, the connection is the special emphasis for five young musicians from different countries: connection between the past and the present by bringing music from the past to years from today, connection between themselves on the stage and the connection between them and their audience.     Every five musicians have had access to a solid education with renowned musicians in the field of historically informed performance practice. These fundamentals enable them to approach the music of the baroque ear in historically accurate way with a respect and knowledge about them, but with new insight, in order to play it in a creative and unconventional way.     The Ensemble won prizes at diverse international early music competitions such as XVII. Biagio Marini Competition 2016, York Early Music International Young Artist Competition 2015, Alice-Samter Competition 2014 and International Berlin Bach Competition 2013. Furthermore Nexus Baroque has been entitled as \u201eRheinsberger Hofkapelle\u201c in year 2014 with honor to represent Musikakademie Rheinsberg. The ensemble is supported by European project \u201eEmerging European Ensembles\u201c since 2016 and has had concerts in France, Romania and Slovenia.     With their current programme \u201eHumming Bach, Whispering Bach.\u201c gives the Ensemble Nexus Baroque a special colours to vocal works of the great master Johann Sebastian Bach. Without words. This is not a completely new way of interpretation, since Bach himself transcribed vocal music into instrumental several times during his life. For example a Choral from his cantata \"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme. BWV. 140\", composed in 1731, has been transcribed into an Organ solo BWV. 645 in 1748.     \"Humming Bach, Whispering Bach\" is a concert program with which ensemble nexus baroque is willing to show it's audience that the beauty and musical value of Bach's works are recognizable even without words.     Nexus Baroque (DE)     NEXUS [lat. Connection], links old and new. Our perpetual aim: never losing the contact between music, ourselves and you (our audience).     Haven't you ever hummed arias and chorals from Johann Sebastian Bach?     Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 \u2013 1750), a well-known German composer and musician of baroque period, has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time since the 19th- century Bach Revival. Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organization, and his adaption of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. His compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular, Latin church music, Passions, oratorios and motets and they are being performed worldwide.     With its concert program \u201eHumming Bach, Whispering Bach\u201c ensemble Nexus Baroque performs Bach's vocal works of different genres such as aria, choral and recitative in an unconventional way. Without words. This is not a completely new way of interpretation, since Bach himself transcribed vocal music into instrumental several times during his life. For example a Choral from his cantata \"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme. BWV. 140\", composed in 1731, has been transcribed into an Organ solo BWV. 645 in 1748.     \"Humming Bach, Whispering Bach.\" is a concert programme with which ensemble Nexus Baroque is willing to show its audience that the beauty and musical value of Bach's works are recognizable even without words.     The ensemble was confronted with the challenge of rendering the content of the Bach \u0301s vocal works with an instrumental sound. It was necessary to find media and ways to reach it without ruining the enchantment of the music.     There ensued various possibilities for the approach to the text, first the work with the instrumentation: Who will assume the role of the solo voice? Who has an accompaniment function? In most works, the ensemble decided to swap the habitual roles. The recorders, which otherwise rather coruscate in the main voices, assume often the accompaniment function in this program. The cello, usually known as continuo instrument, is performing as soloist.     This decision gave the ensemble cellist Hyngun Cho the mission of working directly with the texture and the sound quality of the vocal parts. While singing, the human voice is no\u0301t working only with the vowels and the consonants. Between the production of single tones, between vowel and consonant or also between still and consonant sound noises, timbres, which substantiate the statement and illustrate the character of the work. These worlds of sound let operate the setting of the text more pictured. Hyngun Cho worked on imitating this timbre on the cello. He consistently reflected upon the text and his statement, just as a singer would do.     The comprehension of the text was one of the very important points in their research: the meaning of the text, how to pronounce the words, what syllables are accentuated and how to render those informations instrumental. For example, the word \u201cziehen\u201d [de. pull], has to be pronounced\/articulated with the feeling of pulling a heavy door. The soloist plays the part with emphasis on the place of \u201czie\u201d with a long \u201ci\u201d. The ensemble reflected a long time about the German lyrics. How to express meaning of different German words instrumental: \u201cFrieden\u201d [de. peace] and \u201cRuhe\u201d [de. silence] with the cello? The cellist worked with the sound of the instrument: the way of using his bow on strings to make the sound \u201clight and quiet\u201d.     The theme, played by flute, of the Aria \u201dIch folge dir gleichfalls\u201d from St John Passion BVW. 245 (I follow you likewise), written for Soprano solo, two flutes (unison) and basso Continuo, is being imitated by the solo soprano. The ensemble replaced the solo soprano part with a descant-recorder and the flute part with a voice flute. This new instrumentation makes a well-blended consort-like sound with two flutes and enables the imitation between two voices to come to the fore which gives the whole composition a touch of a trio sonata.     Replacing voices is not the only method of an arrangement. The choral \"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme.\" for Organ solo BWV. 645 is being played by two recorders (unison), cello, lute and organ. This enlargement of the instrumentation brings them a possibility to make the piece richer in colour: the basso Continuo instruments (lute and organ) can play with chords since the melody is being played by two recorders and the whole group get chance to perform the piece with further dynamics. Nexus Baroque won a wide range of colours by using varied instrumentations which makes the concert program versatile. Aria \u201cBist du bei mir\u201d from \u201cNotebook for Anna Magdalena Bach\u201d BWV. 508 played by cello solo and lute accompaniment and Prelude from the Suite for lute solo in g-minor BWV. 995 bring the concert peaceful moments with decent colours whilst Aria \u201c\u00d6ffnet euch ihr beiden Ohren\u201d from cantata BWV. 175 played by full cast leads the concert to the vigorous finale. Furthermore, placing choral, recitative and instrumental movements between arias with different characters gives the program a cantata-like dramaturgy.     Not everyone understands the German language in which Bach wrote his vocal works. But the musical language of Bach can touch everyone.

Previdno zmeljemo, da se zmes sprime v kroglo. Zmes prepolovimo in vsakega vstavimo v dva enaka, manj\u0161a peka\u010da, obl\u017eena s plasti\u010dno folijo. Vse skupaj postavimo v hladilnik, da se \u201ctesto\u201d strdi.     Med tem pripravimo borovni\u010dev nadev \u2013 presno marmelado. V sekljalniku zmeljemo borovnice in agavin sirup. Nato dodamo \u0161e chia semena in prelijemo v posodico, kjer se bo marmelada zgostila.     Pripravimo \u0161e kremni nadev. Indijske ore\u0161\u010dke namakamo v topli vodi vsaj 30 minut. Nato jih dobro speremo pod teko\u010do vodo. V blendetju jih zmeljemo s pribli\u017eno 2 dcl vode, med mletjem nato dodamo \u0161e kokosovo maslo, sol in agavin sirup. Masa mora biti gladka, brez grudic. Na koncu ji med mletjem dodamo \u0161e nad paro stopljeno kokosovo olje, da se vse sestavine dobro pove\u017eejo. Tako pripravljeno kremo nalijemo v en, \u017ee prej pripravljen peka\u010d s testom, postavimo v zamrzovalnik, da se krema popolnoma strdi (pribli\u017eno 30 minut).     Ko je strjena na vrh prema\u017eemo \u0161e borovni\u010devo marmelado in \u010dez polo\u017eimo drug del testa. Ne\u017eno pritisnemo, da se oba del asprimeta. Postavimo v zamrzovalnik za 15 minut.     Med tem pripravimo \u0161e \u010dokoladni preliv. Nad paro stopimo kakavovo maslo, nato dodamo kakav v prahu in z metlico me\u0161amo, da ne ostane kak\u0161na grudica, na koncu po\u010dasi vlivamo \u0161e agavin sirup.     Strjene \u010dupavce previdno razre\u017eemo na kocke in jih pomakamo v \u010dokoladni preliv. Odlagamo jih na peka\u010d oblo\u017een s permanentnim papirjem.

Raw brownies with blueberrie jam and chocolate     This dessert takes a little more time to prepare, but it is so wonderful and also suitable for the Chistmas time, when we usually take a little more time and also prepare some of the goodies that are not on the menu during the year.     It is a fragile dessert, but at the same time so juicy, it also looks a bit more festive, and I believe that just about anyone can prepare it, if only that light of passion is turned on, so you decide and roll up your sleeves.     Oh, now I have described it as terribly complicated, but it is not, the preparation of raw desserts is actually one of the easiest and nothing can go wrong, because everything can be fixed nicely. In addition, they are unicqe.     These tufts are:     of divine taste a crispy bottom, creamy dessert and chocolate glaze are the perfect combination     if they have something left over, they can also be a great breakfast     they look attractive and can be easily offered on special occasions     Grind the cashews in a mincer to get a coarse flour base mixture. Be careful to not grind for too long, as in this case the oil is extracted from the nuts. Add grated coconut, melted coconut butter and coconut oil, salt. Carefully grind to make the mixture stick to a ball. Cut the mixture in half and place each in two equal, small baking pans lined with plastic wrap. Place everything together in the refrigerator to allow the \u201cdough\u201d to harden.     Meanwhile, prepare the blueberry filling \u2013 fresh jam. Grind blueberries and agave syrup in a mincer. Then add more chia seeds and pour into a bowl where the jam will thicken.     Prepare the cream filling. Soak cashews in warm water for at least 30 minutes. Then wash them well under running water. In a blender, grind them with about 2 dcl of water, then add coconut butter, salt and agave syrup while grinding. The mass should be smooth, without lumps. Finally, while grinding, add coconut oil melted over steam to combine all the ingredients well. Pour the cream prepared in this way into one previously prepared baking pan with the dough, place it in the freezer so that the cream hardens completely (about 30 minutes).     When it is hardened, coat the top with blueberry jam and place another part of the dough over it. Gently press both parts together. Place in the freezer for 15 minutes.     Meanwhile, prepare the chocolate topping. Melt the cocoa butter over the steam, then add the cocoa powder and mix with a whisk so that no lumps remain, at the end slowly pour in the agave syrup. Carefully cut the hardened tufts into cubes and dip them in the chocolate sauce. We place them on a baking tray lined with permanent paper. Sprinkle them with grated coconut and lyophilized pieces of strawberries and place them all in the fridge to harden the chocolate.     The brownies are divine, I promise you will inspire many with them.

Having gained some early research experience in Toxicology in the laboratory of prof. dr. Marija Sollner Dolenc at the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, I decided to take on a master's thesis project at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. My thesis was entitled Alternative microRNA promoters and was carried out under mentorship of assist. prof. Toma\u017e Bratkovi\u010d and co-mentorship of dr. Ulf A. \u00d8rom (Long non-coding RNA research group). Upon graduation I put my efforts in R&D activities in the pharmaceutical industry as a global regulatory affairs associate to gain insight in the overall drug development process. I later decided to dedicate full-time to my research-oriented endeavors starting a PhD in Toxicology at the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Ljubljana, again in prof. dr. Sollner Dolenc's laboratory. A part of my PhD research project is a collaboration with the Laboratory of Toxicology (E. Cosini Lab), Department of Environmental Science and Policy and Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Milan, where I spent 3 months as a visiting scientist.

        "text":" Renewables assuming greater role in the EU energy mix, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions     Wind, solar and other renewable energy sources are steadily increasing their share in energy consumption across the European Union, further reducing the need for CO2-emitting fossil fuel energy, according to a report published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today. This trend is driving down greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation, buildings\u2019 heating and cooling, and transport.     The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

It strives to advocate their interests and generally better the conditions for the dynamic cultural and artistic production of the so called 'independent sector'.     Established in Ljubljana in 1992 as an informal network, Asociacija officially registered as a non-profit cultural organisation in 2003 and \u2013 via funds obtained from the European Social Fund \u2013 got professionalised in 2009. The organisation has about 50 major NGOs and a few hundred of freelancers as members.     Contents     Mission     Asociacija aims to accelerate and refine the articulation of political will at the level of cultural policy makers in order to create conditions for a long-term sustainability of different artistic practices and practitioners, especially in the spheres that are of a lower priority to governmental institutions. It tries to create an equal opportunity platform for the independent sectors, particularly in relation to working conditions, financial support and evaluation mechanisms. Another task of the association is to monitor legislation and propose measures that ensure and better the social security of culture freelancers.     Featured activities of Asociacija also include organising public round tables and workshops and publishing manuals and analyses on the functioning of NGOs and the possibilities of their improvement. Asociacija is regularely successful in a number of cases that relate to legislation procedures, governmental strategic documents, public funding arrangements, and other systemic measures. It also organised protests against cuts into cultural funding.     Publications     Asociacija published the Study on the Lack of Facilities for Independent Activities in the Field of Culture in Ljubljana (1998 and 1999), which had important influence on improving the infrastructure conditions of NGOs in culture (i.e. the establishment and\/or preservations of the Old Power Station, Tovarna Rog, Kino \u0160i\u0161ka, Metelkova, etc.).     Another project was the publication of The White Book which contains statistical data from the years 1998 to 2001 about its members (currently about 50 major NGOs and hundreds of freelance artists) and which showed that the NGOs in the field of art and culture produce results equal to those of the public sector and that the served public interest is comparable to the results and effects of the public sector in culture. Later followed published statistics about the number of cultural events produced by its members in 2006. In 2009 Asociacija launched the national project Networking and Capacity Building of the NGO in Culture, partly funded by the European Social Fund.     International projects     In 2017, Asociacija initiated CUBUS, a web information hub for culture and business collaborations in the Balkans. It is meant to explore the different models of such practices, present studies of the relevant legislative frameworks, and to be an ever-growing resource of knowledge for artists, NGOs, business and policy-makers.     Asociacija's main partners in this project are Association for Culture and Art CRVENA (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Jadro \u2013 Association of the independent culture scene (Macedonia), and Centre for Empirical Cultural Studies of South-East Europe (Serbia).     In 2020, Asociacija and its partners were selected on the Creative Europe Western Balkans call to participate in the project \"Regional Lab: New Culture Spaces and Networks as drivers of an Innovative and Sustainable Bottom-up Development of Regional Collaboration\" led by Kooperativa \u2013 Regional Platform for Culture from Croatia.

        "text":" Amicus Curiae     The Faculty of Law, University of Maribor organizes the Amicus Curiae project in cooperation with the Administration Court in Ljubljana and Maribor and the District Court in Maribor.     The project aims to encourage students to actively participate in solving court cases. A court allows the students to study a certain case - however, they cannot take the case file out of the court house or spread any of the information they were revealed. After being given a chance to study the situation correctly, they need to advise the court on the use of the appropriate law, also looking at EU and international law, determine the proper jurisdiction and discover as much as possible about the related problem. When examining the case in details, they also try to find the solution to the problem.     Mentors guide the students, advise them in their study and finally correct their written submissions, yet they do not provide the students with the solutions to the problem. It is their goal to only steer the students in the right direction so they can individually find the correct solution. Exactly this individual work is paramount for the creation of independent lawyers that know how to use the law and how to apply it to real life situations.     It can most definitely be said that this is a win-win situation for all of the involved \u2013 students get to see how the courts work and independently analyze a real-life situation, judges get some additional information about the case and the mentors get a beautiful overlook of the current court practice. The project does not affect the work of the courts.     The project is carried out through both semesters and students prepare more than 60 advising opinions each year.     The project is led by FullProfessor Rajko Knez Ph.D., other mentors are Full Professor Martina Repas Ph.D. and Associate Professors Janja Hojnik Ph.D. and Suzana Kralji\u0107 Ph.D..

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe.

The project wants to support the increasing number of Master\u2019s coordinators and directors who want to improve their admissions and seek assistance in that process. It will do so by bringing together, in regional focus groups and other types of gatherings, experts in admission matters and Master\u2019s coordinators who have already developed good practices or are keenly in need to change their practice. Based on these interactions and exchanges, as well as on the reports, a set of tools will be developed and made available so that many more Master\u2019s coordinators can build tailor-made competence-based selection.

        "text":" Intraoperative Parathyroid Hormone Assessment in Patients with Primary Hyperparathyroidism \u2013 One\u2013Year Experience     Boris Greif, Alja\u017e Hojski, Anton Crnjac     University Medical Centre Maribor, Division of Surgery, Department of Thoracic Surgery, Maribor, Slovenia; University of Maribor, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Maribor, Slovenia     Oddelek za torakalno kirurgijo,     UKC Maribor, Ljubljanska ulica 5,     ABSTRACT     Purpose: We evaluated our one\u2013 year experience in the intraoperative measurement of parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) in parathyroid adenoma surgery. We also compared surgical outcome after minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) and conventional neck exploration (CNE).     Methods: Between April 2011 and April 2012, eight consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) underwent parathyroidectomy with IOPTH in our institution. Parathyroidectomy was defined as successful when a >50% decrease of IOPTH was observed 10 minutes after resection of the abnormal gland. The second criterion for success was a six month period of postoperative normocalcaemia.     Results: We performed four MIPs, two unilateral neck explorations, and two bilateral neck explorations, resulting in a total of seven solitary and one double adenomas. IOPTH level decrease expectations were met in all cases. The average length of surgery for MIP was 31 minutes, and 69 minutes for CNE. All patients were eucalcaemic with normal PTH levels during the 6 month follow\u2013up period. Three patients had postoperative hypocalcaemia after CNE and there were no recurrences 6 months postoperatively.     Conclusion: The review of our series of eight consecutive patients with PHP showed a 100% cure rate after employing IOPTH measurement in both surgical approaches. The advantages of MIP are: shorter operating time, better cosmetic results, and a lower incidence of hypocalcaemia. "

        "text":" Peer Review Guidelines     1. INTRODUCTION Review may be defined as a critical, multilayer written evaluation of the value of scientific or professional contributions intended for publication that may contain suggestions to improve the quality of the contribution.     The basic goal of the review is to submit to the Editorial Board all data they need to decide whether to publish an article or not. It shall prevent any publication of plagiarism and articles (e.g. research) with incorrect results. Another equally important goal of reviews is to allow the author to learn about the weaknesses or even errors of their work and correct or improve the quality of the submitted article.     The theory of writing scientific articles is part of science about science and can only be presented in these editorial instructions to reviewers to a limited extent. For this reason some related professional literature sources listed as references in the bibliography at the end of this text were used for the elaboration of these instructions. Reviewers are kindly requested to study these sources or perhaps find new, more recent works.     2. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 2.1 The review procedure will make sure that articles for Tehni\u010dni in vsebinski problemi klasi\u010dnega in elektronskega arhiviranja are presented in accordance with the valid Slovenian SIST ISO standards for documentation, as well as international standards to be shortly adopted as Slovenian ISO standards of documentation and information science. Articles must be prepared according to the rules of good writing. All important standards are listed in the references.     2.2 The purpose of the review form is to assist reviewers and make their work more uniform. In this way the Editorial Board of Tehni\u010dni in vsebinski problemi klasi\u010dnega in elektronskega arhiviranja wishes to acquire concise and clear presentation of the review results. It is adapted for the reviewers of scientific articles. For other types of articles the reviewers are requested to apply it correspondingly and leave out the requirements exceeding their scope. If, for example, a professional article that does not represent repetition of a research but a description of another professional work is to be reviewed, generally the author does not have to make an initial hypothesis, etc.     2.3 Reviewing shall be more than (perhaps) mechanical completing of form columns. For this reason reviewers have a possibility to add their own comments in adequate form column (6 Special reviewer's findings), enclose comments to the form or write a separate reviewer's article. Especially in the latter case reviewers shall pay attention to meet the original goal of the review.     2.4 The reviewer should focus on the contextual aspect of the article (interest, innovation, suitability for publishing) since the authors who do not follow editorial guidelines are asked to correct their texts. However, the reviewer points to an eventual language inadequacy of the article (incorrect use of scientific terminology and language incomprehension) or inconsistencies at citing or at the scientific equipment of the article (footnotes, references).     2.5 The reviewer also points to eventual essential or slight remarks on the text. He\/she also checks if the topic has already been researched and the author did not consider previous findings. The reviewer should also pay special attention to the methodological aspect of the article (suitability of used methods, sampling, hypothesizing) and the structure of the article. Minor remarks or\/and corrections can be written in the text.     2.6 Reviewer decides whether the article is:     appropriate for publication without improvements;     appropriate for publication with minor improvements (editor's decision)     appropriate for publication after major improvements and another revision;     not appropriate for publication.     2.7 The reviewer defines the classification, which can differ from the one suggested by the author. Typology of documents\/works for bibliography management in the Slovenian cooperative bibliographic system COBISS is used:     1.08 Published Scientific Conference Contribution A published scientific conference contribution (lecture, presentation, poster), published as a whole in the separate conference proceedings, in a scientific journal or on the conference's and\/or conference organiser's website. The published contribution should, in principle at least, be organised as a scientific article.     1.09 Published Professional Conference Contribution A published scientific conference contribution (lecture, presentation, poster), published as a whole in the separate conference proceedings, in a scientific journal or on the conference's and\/or conference organiser's website. The published contribution should, in principle at least, be organised as a scientific article.     1.25 Other articles. All articles which could not be classified in any of the above mentioned classes.     2.8 The reviewer may write the whole review as a special review paper or enclose part of it to the form.     The enclosure may include e.g.:     special reviewer's observations that cannot be classified in the form columns,     requests for corrections and completions of the reviewed text,     comments related to the completing of the form, when considered necessary.     Especially negative evaluations and (later) recommendation to the Editorial Board not to publish the article require adequate argumentation.     2.9 Reviewers of individual articles are chosen by the editorial board respecting the anonymity of the review procedure. Reviews are given to authors anonymously. The reviewer keeps one copy of the review for his use in case of a new review. With signing this form, the reviewer declares that he\/she will cooperate with the editorial board of Tehni\u010dni in vsebinski problemi klasi\u010dnega in elektronskega arhiviranja as a reviewer, will respect the process' anonymity principle and will not use information and findings from the reviewed article before its publishing.     2.10 Signed review should be sent to the editorial board address: Pokrajinski arhiv Maribor, Publikacija Tehni\u010dni in vsebinski problemi klasi\u010dnega in elektronskega arhiviranja, Glavni trg 7, SI-2000 Maribor or via fax +3862\/ 228 50 39, +3862\/252 25 64 or scanned at radenci2015@pokarh-mb.si.     3.

In 1620 was founded a philosophy, theology and economy department of Vienna University. In 1628 a statute ofFala Universitywas certified by Vienna University. The castle is today a private property since December 2006. Nearby the castle, up to the river flow, is The Fala hydroelectric power plant which was built between 1913 and 1918. As a technological and construction achievement of its time, the Slovenian Ministry of Culture included it in its register of monuments of national importance in 2008. "

        "text":" OK Geometry is an aid for analysing geometric constructions. Given a dynamic geometric construction OK Geometry detects patterns as well as certain properties of the construction. You may think of OK Geometry as a pair of geometric spectacles for observing invariants of dynamic geometric constructions. Detecting properties is, among other, an important step in proving facts. OK Geometry may also help in organising the found information.     You can download the latest version of OK Geometry software and documentation from the OK Geometry web page.     OK Geometry consists of three modules, related to three modes of work.     The Easy mode is intended for occasional users and for students who are learning the concept of deductive proof. It provides the geometric analysis of dynamic geometric constructions directly imported from common dynamic geometry systems (GeoGebra, Cabri Geometre, C.a.R., Cynderella, Sketchometry, JGEX). The Basic mode is intended for enthusiast who like to investigate challenging problems in plane geometry. This mode allows the design and automated observation of constructions, including implicit constructions and constructions based on optimisation. The Plus mode is aimed at specialists in triangle geometry. It combines automated observation with a huge database of triangle characteristics. The references for the three modes are available on the links below.

        "text":" The Institute for Spatial Policies (IPoP), established in 2006, is an independent research institute. Its mission is to achieve synergies across a range of disciplines and practices that deal with space and place, to raise awareness of the spatial dimension, and to consider the possibilities to guide policies of space.     Activities     The activities of the IPoP include planning, consulting, expert networking, and the implementation of educational activities. In addition to organising lectures, the institute has established an online library of papers and publications focusing on themes from the IPoP areas of expertise, naming only strategic spatial planning, public space research, and a cross-cultural research of urbanisation.     International projects and networking     Since 2009 the Institute for Spatial Policies has been the URBACT point for Slovenia. URBACT is an European exchange and learning programme for the promotion of sustainable urban development.     Up to 2010 the IPoP worked on the project PoLok (a support to local initiatives) with partners Trajekt and the Community-Based Natural Resource Management Network (CBNRM Net). The aim of the project was to connect people who participate actively in the creation of inhabitant-friendly neighbourhoods.     Since September 2015 the institute has been involved into an international project for improving urban spaces together with refugees, called Refugees for Co-Creative Cities. The project that stems from the Ruhr area in Germany brings together engineers, refugees, artists and locals in order to improve private and public spaces. These spaces could function either as a long-term refugee accommodation or as spaces where locals and refugees interact.     In the period 2015\u20132016 the IPoP collaborated in the project New Ideas For Old Buildings led by the Municipality of Ajdov\u0161\u010dina and funded by the Europe for Citizens Programme. The programme involved a number of small and medium sized towns: Cesis in Latvia, Oberhausen in Germany, Pula in Croatia, Belgrade in Serbia, Nik\u0161i\u0107 in Montenegro and Ajdov\u0161\u010dina and Maribor in Slovenia. The project focused on improving public property management and assisted municipalities to increase the real estate occupancy by public participation.     Jane\u2019s Walk is a movement of free, citizen-led walking tours inspired by Jane Jacobs. The walks get people to tell stories about their communities, explore their cities, and connect with neighbours. Since 2011 the iPop is the Jane\u2019s Walk coordinator for Slovenia, and together with local partners the institute so far has managed to initiate 73 walks in different towns and cities across Slovenia. The discussions during the walks result in recommendations for spatial improvements.

        "text":" Pages     Tuesday, 30 April 2013     Competition protection in the interest of the private sector or of the state?     Telekom \u2013 The Impregnable State Fortress     Last month, the Ljubljana District Court issued its ruling, completely dismissing T-2\u2019s damages claims against Telekom Slovenije in the amount of 130 million euros. T-2 filed its lawsuit already six years ago against Telekom Slovenije over alleged anti-competitive actions, which, it claimed, prevented it from successfully entering the internet services market. The main hearing did not get underway until January of this year, but it finished in just an hour and a half, so the ruling was no surprise. At the hearing, the judge did not even ask the question of whether or not the claims of Telekom\u2019s abuse of dominant market position were founded, but first verified that T-2 had submitted enough evidence to calculate the damages. Since the judge was of the opinion that a solid cubic meter of documents was insufficient, she completed the proceedings without even giving T-2 an opportunity to submit additional evidence for its claims. With such a conclusion to the case in which the parties submitted to the court a total of three thousand pages of written materials over the course of six years and over five thousand pieces of evidence, one has to ask the question, what poses the greatest obstacle to competition: Telekom, the Civil Procedures Act, or Slovenian courts themselves? Or is this a concerted action?     Is Telekom not guilty?     Telekom\u2019s management continues to insist that it has always adhered to Slovenian legislation, and that it has not violated any competition rules. Yet the facts suggest otherwise. Telekom\u2019s competitors have been fighting against its anti-competitive activities and abuse of dominant market position since 1996. In these fifteen years, at least a dozen proceedings have been initiated before the Slovenian Competition Protection Agency (previously the Competition Protection Office). The Agency has never been particularly keen on investigating Telekom\u2019s alleged abuses, as the proceedings for establishing the existence of infringements have always been dragged out longer than stipulated by law, but it has nonetheless issued a few decisions.     In three cases, the Supreme Court even confirmed the Agency\u2019s findings on the existence of Telekom\u2019s abuses of dominant market position and anti-competitive activities. A few of the Agency\u2019s decisions are still pending the court\u2019s final ruling; however, the proceedings are taking far too long. At the moment, the Agency is still dealing with a few ongoing proceedings against Telekom, concerning at least a dozen different alleged abuses. This includes the proceeding that was launched on a proposal of T-2 three years ago and should otherwise have been concluded last year; however, the Agency has yet to issue a statement of objections.     Merely considering these cases makes it difficult to believe Telekom\u2019s claims of adherence to competition legislation. Regardless of already proven abuses, Telekom\u2019s management insistently denies that Telekom\u2019s activities have caused damage to competitors or limited consumers\u2019 choices in any way. At any rate, apologising to the affected parties is beyond the ken of Slovenian managers, despite all the ethical codes adopted, as these are apparently null and void for the powerful, influential, and ruthless.     Abuse in the name of national interest     Telekom has support from established Slovenian experts and institutions that provide expert opinions that defend its anti-competitive activities. They have provided expert opinions in several proceedings, stating that Telekom\u2019s activities did not cause any damage to its competitors, but that they were rather beneficial for competitors, as they protected them from entering and operating in markets where they would incur losses. There are also concerns among Slovenian legal experts, claiming that Slovenia is not yet ready for private enforcement of competition protection, as it might lead to competitors abusing damages claims, with the exclusive objective of grabbing a market share from companies with a dominant market position. From a professional standpoint, such opinions are absurd, yet they serve the notorious \u201cnational interest,\u201d the catchphrase whose amorphous meaning fluidly shifts to best suit the current needs of holders of such interests.     Certainly, it is not in the interest of Telekom\u2019s majority owner, the state, which also makes decisions about its property through the judicial system, to let successful lawsuits devalue the \u201cfamily heirloom,\u201d which has been filling the state\u2019s coffers with dividends, as well as financing various private interest groups, and which appears to be set to remain in state ownership for the foreseeable future. Yet as long as Telekom remains in state ownership, one cannot completely exclude from the realm of reasonable doubt that the Agency and the courts will remain somewhat biased and \u201cself-censoring\u201d when it comes to ascertaining Telekom\u2019s abuses of dominant position or quantifying damages caused.     Abuses \u2013 net profit     The established anti-competitive activities also benefit Telekom financially. One should not overlook its privileged position, which is evident from the fact that, in spite of established cases of abuse in final judgments no longer subject to appeal, it has never paid any fine as established by law. In the past fifteen years, not a single competitor has lodged a successful claim for damages (not counting two or three out-of-court settlements, which took place under somewhat questionable circumstances). This means that Telekom\u2019s illegally gained revenue can be measured in tens of millions of euros.     It seems almost impossible that any competitor could succeed, although the total amount of claims in open cases is at least 400 million euros, even after T-2\u2019s \u201crejected\u201d lawsuit. ABM has trodden the longest path towards compensation so far, when after a ten-year court case the court of first appeal awarded the company a symbolic compensation, based on an expert opinion. Yet this case has not been conclusively resolved, even though the Constitutional Court has affirmed that Telekom\u2019s actions were anti-competitive.     It could happen that ABM ends up in bankruptcy before it receives damages from the claims, as it already had to go into a compulsory settlement. In any case, it would not be the first company to end up this way. At that point, all the grandiloquent talk about its constitutional right to a trial within a reasonable time will no longer cut the mustard. This would allow Telekom to accomplish its ultimate goal of distorting competition, as it would force an \u201cannoying\u201d competitor out of the market, as well as retain the substantial gains illegally acquired from its abuse.     What does the European Commission say?     What is the crux of the problem? Is it true that Telekom\u2019s anti-competitive actions really do not cause any damage, are the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers incapable of filing proper lawsuits, or does the problem lie in the Slovenian legal system, whose courts \u201cdemand\u201d too much from the injured parties, and are lenient towards the generally larger and more influential companies breaking the law? A number of answers come to mind, however the speedy conclusion of the T-2 vs. Telekom case says a lot about the paucity of knowledge, dedication, and interest of Slovenian judges on the one side, and the vagueness of the legislation on the other.     Establishing damages in anti-competition cases has its own idiosyncrasies, and the European Commission has been well aware of them for some time now. Back in 2005, it launched an initiative on actions for damages to improve private enforcement of EU competition law and facilitate damages actions for infringements of competition rules. The European Commission has imposed fines of several hundred million euros on companies breaching EU competition law, and it finds that anti-competitive activities harm competition to the tune of several billion euros every year. Yet the affected companies only rarely manage to enforce their basic rights to compensation for damages, as established by EU law.     In 2008 the Commission published a White Paper in which it ascertains that antitrust damages cases display a number of particular characteristics that are often insufficiently addressed by traditional rules on civil liability and procedure, which gives rise to a great deal of legal uncertainty. In its draft guidance paper from 2011, the Commission in its Draft Guidance Paper further explains that legal systems shall take into account the inherent difficulties of quantifying such damages and shall ensure that damages actions by foiled market entrants are not made practically impossible or excessively difficult. Have Slovenian judges ever heard of the European Commission\u2019s Actions for Damages project, either by their own initiative or within the scope of their training? Has the Slovenian legal system reflected appropriately on the Commission\u2019s project? Are legislators aware of these issues at all, and are they considering whether any changes to the legislation are required?     Breaking the law is the easiest way to go     In such circumstances, Telecom\u2019s easiest choice is to continue distorting competition, or to victimise and deplete competitors, for example by issuing invoices for disputable services, or \u201cstrategically\u201d filing unfounded lawsuits against competitors (e.g., Centrex), all utterly devoid of any legal interest. Furthermore, breaching the electronic communications legislation and not adhering to decisions issued by the Post and Electronic Communications Agency (e.g., numbering) does not require much effort. Telekom needs merely to bide its time and see if a competitor survives or perhaps goes under, and then to pay millions of euros to a renowned law firm to defend itself, thus dragging out the case long enough for the competitor to go bankrupt.     It has to be noted that some competitors did not even manage to lodge damages claims against Telekom, as they went out of business before that (e.g., K2.net, where the proceedings of ascertaining the abuse lasted for fifteen years!), while others lodged them too late (e.g., Sinfonika, because the provisions on extending the period of limitations for competition disputes were not yet adopted), while others still, much like T-2 recently, allegedly did not submit enough evidence attesting to the damages (e.g., Telego, where the court first confirmed the abuse of dominant position in its preliminary ruling). Some reached out-of-court settlements with Telekom (e.g., Amis). Foreign competitors (e.g., Western Wireless International) decided to pull out of the market when they realised what the conditions were, and decided to invest outside Telekom\u2019s \u201cplayground.\u201d     In an already uneven battle against the former monopoly, Telekom\u2019s competitors have another difficult hurdle to cope with, which can almost be classified as \u201cmission impossible\u201d; they have to gather such evidence of damages caused that will satisfy the courts. What kind of evidence is required, however, remains a mystery, shrouded in the ambiguity of legislation and the absence of any case-law. Courts generally do not focus on providing guidance to parties to understand which facts can be legally relevant in the proceedings and how to supplement statements of claim and evidence accordingly, but instead choose, in the absence of substantive reasons, to \u201csurprise\u201d them by rejecting their claims.     Is there any alternative explanation possible for a state of affairs as explained above? Do Slovenian judges really dare not put the big, influential, and powerful on trial, as Bo\u0161tjan M. Zupan\u010di\u010d, a Slovenian judge at the European Court of Human Rights, and some other respectable lawyers have claimed before? Of course it is much easier to explain a court ruling in one sentence, stating that not enough evidence for calculating the damages was submitted, than to delve into the issues concerning the market and require Telekom\u2019s competitor to provide additional evidence, as the Civil Procedures Act expressly permits.     Experts and damages calculation     As courts lack economic expertise, the damages or loss of profit in competition cases are assessed by expert witnesses, usually economists. However, there are several ways of assessing damages, as economics, after all, is not an exact science, and is constantly developing and evolving. The same holds for law \u2013 although some judges might not admit it \u2013 just like they might have never heard that the Slovenian competition law should give precedence to EU law, respect EU case-law and follow the principles of EU tort law and its specifics in competition cases.     The evidence required for the assessment of damages depends on the methodology that will be used by the chosen expert witness when establishing \u201cthe past that did not take place,\u201d and that is why neither the parties nor the courts can know beforehand what kind of evidence the expert witness will even require. Moreover, much of the evidence lies in the hands of the offending party, and as the damaged party has no access to it, only the courts can try to obtain it during the proceedings.     Should the victims of anti-competitive actions submit to courts all the evidence they have, just in case, to ward off possible capricious decisions of some judges? That is what Amis did in its lawsuit against Telekom Slovenije a few years ago, when it submitted a van full of evidence to the court and let the court and expert witness sort their way through it as best as they could. This would certainly not have contributed to the efficiency of the case, but fortunately for the judge and expert witness, the parties reached a settlement before the court proceedings began.     \u00bbDo Slovenian judges really dare not put the big, influential, and powerful on trial? Of course, it is much easier to explain a court ruling in one sentence, stating that not enough evidence for calculating the damages was submitted, than to delve into the issues concerning the market and require Telekom\u2019s competitor to provide additional evidence, as the Civil Procedures Act expressly permits.\u00ab     In the Tu\u0161mobil vs. Telekom Slovenije case, the judge stated already at the beginning of the proceedings that only the expert witness, yet to be appointed by the court, would have a say as to what evidence would be required in order to estimate the damages, and only then would the court demand such evidence from both parties. Apparently this judge was well informed about the above-mentioned European Commission project, as she even referred to the Commission\u2019s study on Quantifying Antitrust Damages. She also notified the parties that the court may use its discretionary power to determine the amount of damages, should anti-competitive actions be proven beyond any reasonable doubt.     As mentioned above, the law does allow but does not require the courts to give notice to the plaintiffs before the main hearing to supplement their claims and provide additional evidence. This is exactly what the judge did in a recent hearing in the Akton vs. Telekom Slovenije case, when she advised the plaintiff that it had not submitted enough evidence to calculate the damages, calling upon it to appropriately supplement the evidence.     Why, then, did the judge in the T-2 vs. Telekom Slovenije case not do the same, if acquiring evidence is especially critical in competition-related disputes? Did the judge not want to know the substance of the case, or know how to define the facts that might have been missing in the plaintiff\u2019s claims and evidence? Nothing is easier than to reject a case due to alleged insufficient evidence for calculating the damages, without ever asking oneself whether the plaintiff\u2019s claims are well-founded. Nevertheless, can the fate of a hundred million euro lawsuit depend on the mere readiness, expertise, level of authority, or momentary mood of each individual judge?     Why competition protection?     Slovenia has no case-law for the private enforcement of competition protection, which is an alarming piece of information given indisputably confirmed breaches of competition law, thus also pointing to the effort of courts which have \u201csuccessfully\u201d avoided the resolution of such disputes. Before his \u201ctemporary\u201d resignation, Minister of Justice Senko Pli\u010dani\u010d called into question the professional qualifications of judges, as some of them prefer not to tackle more difficult cases, letting other judges or judges at courts of higher instance handle them. For instance, three judges were changed in the T-2 case, as well as in the ABM case.     Competitors who have suffered damages can thus only rely on the Slovenian legislation and the case-law of the EU Court. The European Commission recommendations mentioned above are not binding for the Slovenian courts, although the Constitutional Court has ruled, and as the EU Court has also stipulated, that national regulation should be interpreted in the light of EU law (lat. interpretatio europea), and that this interpretation should overrule other interpretations of legal norms. Future damages or loss of profit can never be calculated to the penny and estimated with the certainty towards which the Slovenian courts apparently strive. Nonetheless, the courts could readily ascertain damages based on the current legislation. It would just take a bit more effort. For the beginning, they should just pose themselves a simple question as to how much undue profit has Telekom made from its abuses.     In civil proceedings, and especially in competition cases, evidence standards cannot be set as high as in criminal proceedings. If even the most reputable and experienced law firms, with armies of top-notch lawyers, cannot over the course of several years succeed in gathering enough evidence to bring a trial to court, and if the courts do not bother with providing guidance to all parties, then all the victims of anti-competitive actions can forget about the justice promoted by the European Commission and should not even bother filing claims for compensation.     This begs the question as to whether we even need competition legislation, or would it not be more appropriate, in the spirit of widespread austerity spending cuts, to just abolish the Competition Protection Agency altogether, and maybe even judicial protection in the field of competition law? Exactly twenty years since the first Competition Protection Act was adopted, and the Competition Protection Agency established on its basis, the electronic communications market has experienced no hint of its influence. We also have yet to see any effect from the work of the courts through stern and just rulings that would give competition law the effet utile it needs to serve as an actual deterrent to those who breach competition law, and to award damages to ensure both consumers\u2019 welfare and a functioning market!     This article is written based on my years of monitoring competition protection and related disputes in the field of electronic communications. I hereby state that I do not own any shares of T-2, nor am I involved in any business relationship with the company or its legal representatives.

        "text":" Nordijski center Planica - Biro Stvar     Uporabljamo pi\u0161kotke.     Planica     Slovenian alpine valley under the Ponce mountains prides itself with a unique natural setting, exceptional sporting tradition, technical and construction heritage and ambitions for the development of Nordic Ski disciplines and as a tourist destination. The beginnings of the development of the sports infrastructure go back to the 1930s, when the first ski jump was built. Afterwards, in the desire to hold international competitions, bigger and bigger ski jumps were built and Planica has become a place for innovation, for creating new frames of the sporting discipline by breaking records and pushing the limits of that which is possible. The rich historical development is a testament of mutual cooperation between athletes, organisers and building designers, who have competed here, organised events and developed the infrastructure. The project solutions of the architectural office STVAR became part of the tradition.     02     Competiton     Because of its natural resources Planica represents a unique setting for the development of Nordic Ski disciplines, where unlike many other world arenas, the sports infrastructure is adapted to nature and not the other way around. Only after the independence of Slovenia, when investments couldn\u2019t keep up with development, the area saw degradation. A new carefully thought out project was required for restoration and modernisation, which would provide development for generations to come. This is why in 2009 in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Sport of RS and the Chamber of Architecture and Spatial Planning of Slovenia a public architectural and landscape call was held to select the most appropriate solution for the organisation of the Nordic Ski Centre Planica as the national sport centre. Tender documentation included the integral programme, functional and economic starting points for architectural, landscaping and infrastructural design. Solutions had to provide a functional design and coordinated development of sports and tourist infrastructure with due respect for natural environment and cultural heritage and to enable the implementation of sports and tourist activities, including the organisation of world-class competitions provided by the multi-purpose use of facilities and areas. The first two equal prizes were awarded to the elaborate of the office STVAR focused on architectural solutions and spatial disposition of buildings and the elaborate of the Abiro-AKKA studios focused on landscaping and architectural design and integration of sports facilities.     Project     The role of the investor on behalf of the Republic of Slovenia after the completed call was assumed by the Institute of Sport Planica, which coordinated the synthesis of both tender solutions. The project has followed the ambition for designing a programme and landscaping entry point to the valley of Tamar and Triglav National Park by joining the natural topography of the slopes with the terraced anthropogenic landscape of the valley. The subtle design with careful placement of buildings and sports infrastructure has pursued these principles. The course of competitive cross-country trails follows the configuration of the natural terrain and forest to the greatest extent possible, which preserves the original Alpine setting and the ski flying hill and seven ski jumps with its fan-like design create a unique landscaping trait with the central meeting point under the peak of the slope. The architectural design of the service buildings at the shoulder of the valley and heating facilities at the slope is extremely reserved. The one exception is the Central Building, which is as an architectural focus placed at the centre of the ski jumping and cross-country skiing section of the Nordic Ski Centre Planica. Based on the integral solutions a computer animation was made and the future centre was introduced to the international public. In 2012, the spatial act was coordinated, which enabled the project's integral implementation. Dividing the area to the ski jumping and cross-country skiing section, which is separated by the path to the Tamar valley was followed by the breakdown of project or construction stages. The office STVAR took over the planning of service and warm-up buildings and project management of the reconstruction of the Gori\u0161ek Brothers Flying Hill in the ski jumping section and within the cross-country section the planning of the Central Building together with project management of the corresponding infrastructure and landscaping.     constructed 2014-2015     Cross-country skiing trails     designed 2010-2015     For the entire centre a water supply system has been carried out as an independent project, which among other things includes bores for the exploitation of underground water, pumping station for irrigation and snow making in the \u010caplja building, as well as collection and reuse of rainwater through the reservoir and central control system. For every project engineering stage the investor has acquired a contractor with a public call. The construction of separate stages took place under joint construction supervision for the entire centre. The opening of the Nordic centre Planica took place in December of 2015. The projected investment value and actual construction costs were within plans and foreseen economic starting points of the call. The engineered programme and functional design of the entire arrangement and facilities was successfully tested already in 2015 and 2016 with world class events, such as the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup Finals and FIS Cross-country World Cup.     05     Nordic Centre     \u201cAfter six years and almost 50 million Euros, the Nordic Ski Centre Planica has become in terms of expertise and execution one of the most complex infrastructural projects in Slovenia, which is specific also for European standards. It is a morphological masterpiece, where the topography of the terrain almost completely blends in with the architecture and at the same time the architecture intervenes in the characteristic Alpine setting as minimally invasive as possible. The authors with their interdisciplinary approach managed to create a decent, almost ascetic conglomerate of different facilities, which because of its reserve appear even more majestic.\u201d Source: MMC RTVSLO, Trend Award, December 2015 "

        "text":" The prevailing rule of an x-ray absorption spectrum is the monotonic dependence of the x-ray absorption with the photon energy, interspersed with sharp edges (Fig. 4). However, the detailed shape of the edge and of the x-ray absorption spectrum above it contains useful structural information. In the dominant absorption process of photoeffect, an electron is ejected from the core, mostly from the deepest level accessible to the photon energy. The photoelectron is emitted in the form of a simple spherical wave when the atom is free, i.e. in a monatomic gas sample. If the atom is incorporated in dense matter, or even in a molecule, the outgoing wave and, consequently, the probability of the photoeffect, is modified by the surroundings. The problem of calculating the outgoing waves in the strong field of adjacent atoms in a solid or liquid sample is notoriously difficult: it has to be tackled in full for slow photoelectrons, i.e. when the incident photon energy is just above the threshold. This region of the absorption spectrum, so called XANES ( = X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure) contains valuable information on chemical bonds and the site symmetry [5,6].     Fig. 4. X-ray absorption coefficient of copper in the region of L and K edges. The box area is expanded in the inset to show EXAFS and XANES signal.     Further out from the absorption edge, in the EXAFS ( = Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) spectral region, the problem of the photoelectron wave is considerably simplified [6,7]. With the shorter photoelectron wavelength, the adjacent atoms scatter the photoelectron as point obstacles, each contributing a tiny wavelet (Fig. 5). The interference pattern of the photoelectron wavelets modifies the probability of the photoeffect. When the absorption spectrum is scanned by changing the photon energy, the energy of the photoelectron changes. Consequently, its wavelength varies, and the interference of the wavelets changes from constructive to destructive and back again. Each atom scatterer contributes a harmonic oscillatory mode, together they form a complex quasiperiodic EXAFS signal: Fourier analysis of the signal resolves the harmonic components into a probability vs distance diagram (Figs. 6, 7). Its peaks occur at rather accurate values of the neighbor atom distances. In addition, the coordination number and chemical species of the neighbor atoms, as well as the statistical spread of their distances due thermal motion or static disorder can be deduced from the size and shape of the peaks.     Fig. 5. Interference of photoelectron waves scattered from neighbor atoms and the resulting oscillation in x-ray photoabsorption probability.     Fig. 6. EXAFS signal of rhodium metal at 80 K above the K-edge (a) and its Fourier transform magnitude (b).     Fig. 7. The contributions of the nearest four shells of neighbors to the Rh EXAFS signal from Fig 6, recovered from the largest peaks in the Fourier transform.     The basic EXAFS experimental method is the standard absorption spectrometry of a thin homogeneous sample of the investigated material above the absorption edge of the element under study. Optimum thickness of the sample is of the order of 10 microns for pure elements (metal foils) and accordingly larger when other (lighter) elements are present. Powdered samples are conveniently attached to layers of adhesive tape or mixed with a light matrix and pressed into thin pellets. The sample must be at least locally homogeneous: if not, the unavoidable small deviations of the x-ray beam position on the sample are translated into spurious intensity variations mimicking the EXAFS signal. The sensitivity of the basic EXAFS experiment is not very high: the measured element must contribute at least a few percent to the beam absorption to produce a meaningful structural signal. Weaker signals tend to be drowned in the statistical noise of the beam. In an alternative method the fluorescence photons from the sample are monitored instead of the transmitted beam, whereby the sensitivity is improved by one or two orders of magnitude. In TEY ( = Total Electron Yield) detection mode the emitted electrons from the sample are registered [8]. Another order of magnitude may be gained in sensitivity; the smaller penetration depth of the electrons, however, limits the sensitivity to a thin layer at the surface of the sample. A good surface sensitivity is provided also by measuring the intensity of the totally reflected x-ray beam: the method requires a perfectly flat surface, though, which precludes it for routine analysis [9]. A specific variant of EXAFS, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) has been developed for investigation of magnetic materials [10,11]. The scan of a standard EXAFS spectrum requires about 20 minutes on a synchrotron beamline \u2013 and several hours on a conventional laboratory x-ray generator. On modern synchrotron x-ray sources with high brilliance much faster detection modes have been developed for studying chemical reactions in real time (Quick EXAFS = QEXAFS 12). Currently, 100 ms for a scan is available, with a promise of a hundredfold improvement with the next generation of coherent x-ray sources (TESLA in Hamburg). The range of the elements amenable to a routine EXAFS analysis depends on the x-ray monochromator. The low-energy limit of the most widely used Si(111) monochromators is around 3 keV, translating to Z = 16 (K edge of sulfur). With special monochromators, the technique can be extended to about 2 keV (K edge of aluminium). For the lightest elements (C, O, N) diffraction gratings are used instead of crystals for beam monochromatization: in this low-energy region (200 - 600 eV), the typical span of the EXAFS signal (1 keV) requires or exceeds the entire monochromator range, so that only XANES spectra are studied [5].     At the high-energy end, the limit is defined by the large-scale parameters of the x-ray source: the storage-ring energy and radius define the critical photon energy above which the intensity of the synchrotron radiation decreases exponentially [4]. Consequently, L3 edge EXAFS instead of K edge is exploited for heavier elements. The switch to L3 is not recommended for elements below antimony (L3 edge 4132 eV, K edge 30491 eV), since the range of the L3 EXAFS signal, cut off by the subsequent L2 edge, is too short so that the spatial resolution of the method is seriously impaired. In the schematic overview of accessible EXAFS intervals in Fig. 8, the relative position of the limiting L2 edge is shown by the thick gray line. However, modern insertion devices (wigglers) generate the high-energy photons much more abundantly and the switch to the L3 EXAFS is practised at higher energies (and atomic numbers) depending on the monochromator resolution. Mostly, L3 edge is exploited for lanthanides and heavier elements.     Fig. 8. The useful interval of EXAFS signals (horizontal dotted lines) as a function of the atomic number. With K-edge energy out of the range of standard monochromators, L3 edge EXAFS is measured for heavier elements. The thick gray line shows the relative position of L2 edge truncating the L3 EXAFS signal. The relative excitation energies of sharp multielectron photoexcitation features in the EXAFS interval are shown by dots.     E-mail:iztok.arcon@p-ng.si Last change: 31-Mar-2004 "

Preizkusil sem \u017ee veliko za\u010dimbnih me\u0161anic za pripravo curry omake in vedno znova ugotovil, da se najbolj obnese curry v rumeni stekleni\u010dki blagovne znamke Maestro.     Sestavine za 4 osebi: olje, 1 \u010debula, 2 stroka \u010desna, 400 g pi\u0161\u010dan\u010djega fileja, curry, pol \u017eli\u010dke ingverja, sol, svetla (light) sojina omaka, 1 plo\u010devinka kokosovega mleka (400 ml), 1 plo\u010devinka mlade koruze v stor\u017eih, \u010dili v prahu     V ponvi segrejemo olje in na njem prepra\u017eimo sesekljano \u010debulo. Ko \u010debula postekleni, dodamo drobno narezane stroke \u010desna in na tanke kose narezano pi\u0161\u010dan\u010dje meso.     Pra\u017eimo kak\u0161no minuto ali dve. Ves \u010das me\u0161amo. Nato vse skupaj dobro za\u010dinimo s curryem (vsaj 2 mali \u017eli\u010dki), potresemo z ingverjem ter solimo in popramo.     Prilijemo 2 \u017elici sojine omake in dobro preme\u0161amo. Po\u010dakamo, da meso vpije omako.     Prilijemo kokosovo mleko, zmanj\u0161amo temperaturo in na \u0161ibkem ognju kuhamo 20 minut.     Po potrebi dodamo \u0161e malo currya.     Opcija 1: dodamo na majhne cvetove narezano cveta\u010do. Opcija 2: dodamo sesekljano sve\u017eo \u0161pina\u010do. Opcija 3: dodamo na ko\u0161\u010dke narezano mlado koruzo v stror\u017eih.     Kuhamo \u0161e 5 minut. \u010ce imamo radi bolj peko\u010de jedi, lahko v curry dodamo \u0161e nekaj ostrega \u010dilija.

        "text":" Data Scientist, AI Researcher     PhD Thesis     \u2013 CoReAmI \u2013     The research for my PhD was focused on context-based reasoning applied on wearable sensors\u2019 data. That is, I want to include context in the reasoning process and this way to improve the reasoning performance.For example, if an activity recognition system recognizes that the user is sitting and the heart-rate is high (e.g., 130 beats in a minute) that should be an alarming situation regarding the user\u2019s health status. However, this is not necessarily an alarming situation. If the system is aware of the context, e.g., the previous activity of the user, and if that activity is running, it should be able to infer\/reason that this situation is normal and any alarm should be disregarded.     Abstract     The availability of small, wearable, low-cost, power-efficient sensors, combined with advanced signal processing and information extraction, is driving the revolution in the ambient intelligence (AmI) domain. This revolution has enabled novel approaches and technologies for accurate measurements in the area of healthcare, enhanced sports and fitness training, and life-style monitoring.     Early AmI systems included a single type of sensors that has made it possible to develop the first proof-of-concept applications. As the field has matured, these systems have gained additional sensors, resulting in the development of advanced and more accurate multi-sensor techniques and applications. However, combining multiple sources of information from multiple sensors is a challenging task. The first issue is that each sensor has its own technical configuration (for example, the data sampling rate) and requires different data-processing techniques in order to first align the different sensor data, and later to extract useful information. The second issue is that even if the multi-source data is aligned, it can be challenging to find an intelligent way to combine this multi-source information in order to reason about the user or the environment. While several approaches for combining multiple sources of information and knowledge have been developed (such as Kalman filters, ensemble learning, and co-training), these approaches have not been specialized for AmI tasks.     This thesis addresses the problem of combining multiple sources of information extracted from sensor data by proposing a novel context-based approach called CoReAmI (Context-based Reasoning in Ambient Intelligence). The CoReAmI approach consists of three phases: context extraction, context modeling, and context aggregation. In the first phase, multiple contexts are extracted from the sensor data. In the second phase, the problem is modeled using the already extracted contexts. In the third phase, when evaluating a data sample, the models that correspond to the current context are invoked, and their outputs are aggregated in the final decision.     The feasibility of this approach is shown in the three domains that have emerged as essential building blocks in AmI: activity recognition, energy-expenditure estimation, and fall detection. For each of these domains, the thesis offers an appropriate description of the domain, its relevance, and its most relevant related work. The application of the CoReAmI approach to each problem domain is then described, followed by a thorough evaluation of the approach. The results show that CoReAmI significantly outperforms the competing approaches in each of the domains. This is mainly due to the fact that, by extracting multiple sources of information and combining them by using each source of information as a context, a multi-view perspective is created, which leads to better performance than with conventional approaches.     CoReAmI Overview     Intuition     In the thesis a novel Context-based Reasoning approach in Ambient Intelligence called CoReAmI is proposed. It is based on two principles: (i) using context and (ii) using multiple points of view on the same situation.     In order to explain the first principle, consider an example of a user whose heart rate and activities are monitored by an AmI system. Suppose that the system monitors that the user is sitting and has relatively high heart. This could have been an alarming situation, but not if the user was exercising a few moments previously. Therefore, a system that is aware of the context \u2013 that is, the previous activity \u2013 should reason better than one that reasons without context.     The second principle is related to using multiple views in order to reason about a user or environment in general. An intuitive example of this concept could be sensing food, a process of forming a decision (\u201ccomplete picture\u201d) about the food that we eat. When we eat, multiple senses contribute to forming the \u201ccomplete picture\u201d. First, we use the sight to collect the information about the appearance of food. Then, we usually smell the food and finally we taste it. Each of the senses gives unique information about the food and when all three inputs are combined, the \u201ccomplete picture\u201d of the food is formed. However, the three inputs are combined in an intelligent way, not independently. They are combined in such a way that if some sense is missing it influences also the other two. A typical example is when we have a cold and most of the food that we eat has the same taste, and that is only because we cannot smell right.     Using these two principles, we developed CoReAmI, which reasons about the situation from different points of view created by using each source of information as a context individually.     Context-based multi-view perspective     CoReAmI first extracts multiple contexts from multiple sources of information (sensor data). This way, a dataset containing all the contexts and their values is created. Then, it partitions the dataset into multiple subsets according to the values of the extracted contexts i.e., context-based data partitioning. An example dataset with the context-based data partitioning is shown in Figure 1. The dataset consists of three contexts: A, B and C, and a class (decision). In this particular example in Figure 1, B is chosen to be a context, and the dataset is divided into three subsets, each corresponding to a value of B, i.e., B1, B2 and B3. Each row in the dataset is called data instance (a vector that contains the extracted context values and the class value). Therefore, the subset for B1 contains only those data instances (examples) with B1 value. The same procedure is performed for each of the contexts individually, resulting in multiple views, i.e., context-based views, of the dataset. In the next step, for each of the subsets a model is constructed that reasons about the user. Finally, when evaluating a data instance, the decisions provided by each model are aggregated together (by an aggregation function) and the final decision is provided.     Figure 1.     CoReAmI Flowchart     The CoReAmI approach is a general approach for context-based reasoning in AmI. At the top level are the sensors, which provide the raw data. The multiple sensors data is usually represented by multivariate time-series with mixed sampling rates. These time-series are input to our CoReAmI approach. Figure 2 shows an overview of the approach, which consists of three phases marked with A, B and C, where sensors are marked with {s1, \u2026 , sm}, contexts {c1, \u2026 , cn}, context values vc, reasoning data Rvc, and models mc.

Razko\u0161je na tem svetu je: urejeno misliti.     * * *     We are going in the wrong direction: into ourselves, instead of to Him. We are looking down instead of up.     V napa\u010dno smer se zatekamo: Vase, namesto k njemu. Gledamo dol, namesto gor.     * * *     Why do we react to stress with fear and anxiety? It is better to relax and say, \u00bbIt happens!\u00ab     Zakaj reagiramo na stres z zakr\u010denostjo, strahom in tesnobo? Bolje se je sprostiti in re\u010di: Zgodi se!     * * *     To live transcendently means to be true to our spirit.     \u017diveti prese\u017eno pomeni uresni\u010devati svojega duha.     * * *     Happiness always returns to rest in its peace.     Sre\u010da se vra\u010da po\u010divat v svoj mir.     * * *     Life is an open system. Open to eternity. It is not limited by the human mind, but is part of God\u2019s plans.     \u017divljenje je odprt sistem. Odprt v ve\u010dnost. Ne zaokro\u017ea se pri \u010dlove\u0161kem spoznanju, ampak v bo\u017ejih na\u010drtih.     * * *     If I think, I get a headache. If I do not think, I am happy.     \u010ce mislim, me boli glava. \u010ce ne mislim, sem vesel.     * * *     When a genius starts thinking that he is god, he takes a step forward and becomes a fool.     Ko genij za\u010dne misliti, da je bog, s tem naredi korak naprej in postane norec.     * * *     * * *     When I am unhappy, I think there is only what is in my mind. But there isn\u2019t only that.     Kadar sem nesre\u010den, mislim, da je samo to, kar mislim. Pa ni samo to.     * * *     We cannot cheat God. We can only pray to him.     Boga ne moremo prevarati. Lahko ga samo prosimo.     * * *     Life is not an errand, it is a gift. It is not created by us, it comes from above. So we can always expect something nice.     \u017divljenje ni obveznost, ampak dar. Ne ustvarjamo ga mi, ampak prihaja od zgoraj. Zato vedno lahko pri\u010dakujemo kaj lepega.     * * *     * * *     * * *     * * *     Z menoj bo umrla tudi moja bolezen, ne pa moja ljubezen.     * * *     Hurrying means running away from what you would like to achieve.     Hitenje je beg pred tistim, kar bi rad dosegel.     * * *     We always have to be careful that we do not start loving darkness more than light, not even in our thoughts,.     Nenehno moramo paziti nase, da niti v mislih ne vzljubimo teme bolj kot svetlobe.     * * *     How is it that the clouds never droop, but my mood always does?     Kako, da oblaki ne padejo dol? Moje razpolo\u017eenje vedno.     * * *     * * *     If we were fine all the time, we would become proud and would never learn anything.     \u010ce bi nam bilo samo dobro, bi postali o\u0161abni in se ne bi ve\u010d ni\u010desar nau\u010dili.     * * *     It is alright to shape our own character, but let God do the bulk of the work.     Saj je prav, da oblikujemo svoj zna\u010daj, ampak pustimo, da glavno naredi Bog.     * * *     Are you only interested in this world? Don\u2019t you know that it is fleeting? You will live in eternity much longer.     Kaj vas zanima samo ta svet? Kaj ne veste, da je minljiv? V ve\u010dnosti boste prebivali veliko dlje.     * * *     A human being travels to love, from there into death and from death back to love.     \u010clovek potuje do ljubezni, iz nje v smrt in iz smrti spet v ljubezen.     * * *     * * *     What should I do when I rest?     Kaj naj delam, ko po\u010divam?     * * *     I looked for ways to enjoy life, I tried and contemplated. But that is not necessary. To live life as it comes is enough.     Iskal sem poti do u\u017eivanja \u017eivljenja, trudil sem se in razmi\u0161ljal. Ni se treba truditi, le \u017eiveti to, kar je.     * * *     To be: Essence.     Biti Bit.     * * *     Some people get it, others do not. But don\u2019t they get much more?     Enim je dano, drugim pa ni. Ali jim s tem ni dano \u0161e kaj bolj\u0161ega?     * * *     * * *     I long looked for realizations but did not receive them, until I started to love the cognitive.     Dolgo sem iskal spoznanja, pa jih nisem prejel, dokler nisem spoznavanega vzljubil.     * * *     A man matures by shrinking.     \u010clovek zori tako, da se manj\u0161a.     * * *     How can I wish people well if I can see that their main problem lies in the fact that they are too well off.     Kako naj \u017eelim nekaterim dobro, \u010de opa\u017eam, da je njihova glavna te\u017eava v tem, da jim je predobro?     * * *     Everybody has a right to have his own problems.     Vsakdo ima pravico do svojih problemov. "

Analiza dejanskega stanja v enoti je dandanes potrebna za ugotavljanje v kak\u0161nem stanju je enota in brez nje prakti\u010dno ni mo\u010d pri\u010dakovati izbolj\u0161anja vprihodnosti. Kvalitetno izvedbo dodeljenih nalog, lahko enota dose\u017ee z dobro pripravljenostjo in usposobljenostjo. Za enote je pomembno da pogosto analizirajo dosedanje delo, saj lahko le na ta na\u010din pridejo do zaklju\u010dkov, kaj od narejenega je bilo dobro in kaj bi bilo potrebno v prihodnosti popraviti. Za ugotovitev sedanjega stanja priprave motorizirane \u010dete za bojevanje sem se odlo\u010dil, da izvedem z analizo dobrih in slabih strani (prednosti in slabosti). Namen analize je ugotavljanje trenutnega stanja. Izdelava analize je ugotavljanje dobrih in slabih strani glede priprave za bojevanje v motorizirani \u010deti in pomagati motorizirani \u010deti pri izbolj\u0161anju dosedanjih postopkov. Namen je tudi odpraviti napake in poizkusiti izbolj\u0161ati sedanje stanje v enoti ter posvetiti ve\u010d \u010dasa elementom za katere se izka\u017ee, da so slabosti enote. Pomembno je tudi, da se v prihodnosti odpravijo ugotovljene slabosti, izkoristijo ugotovljene prednosti in se izogne prete\u010dimse nevarnostim pri izvedbi priprave. Na podlagi analize sem ugotovil,da so dobre strani v pripravah motorizirane \u010dete predvsem v logistikiin elementu zavarovanja. Slabosti, na katere bo potrebno v bodo\u010de biti \u0161e posebej pozoren sta JRKBO za\u0161\u010dita in psiholo\u0161ka priprava na bojevanje.     AddThis uses cookies that require your consent. Edit consent...     Secondary language     Language:     English     Abstract:     The combat readiness of motorized unit is crucial for the final status of successfully accomplished mission. Advanced tactical approach and training also dramatically reduces possible loss of lives and\/or damage of support & combat vehicles, it in fact also upgrades team spirit and effects squad qualification in general. Analyses of the actual state inside the combat unitare most necessary and without it, future activity of such unit is very limited; life threatened even. The successfully accomplished missions can be achieved only with as good combat readiness status as possible and top qualification of each active unit member. Debriefing process after each training session and\/or live combat operation is crucial for superior officer to determine the future approach to the unit and field of action. The results are extremely important for operational status of the unit in the future, as long as they are processed correctly, because commanding officer\/combat unit leader can acquire details of what is still to be improved in the future. For the determination of the current state of readiness inside the motorized squadI have decided to carry out the positive and negative analyze. (Advantageand disadvantage) Main goal of analyzing process is to determine current state inside the unit, having to deal with advantages and disadvantages regarding preparation for operational status inside the motorized squad and its combat readiness. Also it is important to improve the procedures that are currently being used if they are estimated to be insufficient, unnecessary or present weakness of the unit in general. Finding out about the weakness inside the unit is not enough, such attribute needs to be eliminated in the future, while the positive ones have to be taken under the consideration. The possible danger and risks while executing the tactical training orders should and must be avoided by all means. On the bases of analyze results I have come to the conclusion, that the positive thing while preparing and training of motorized unit is in fact the logistics process and security component. The weakness as far as I see it, would be the radiologic, biologic and chemical warfare protection and psychological readiness for combat engagement in general. "

This thesis presents the main principles of agile software development with emphasis on the method Scrum and some of the group techniques for software estimation. Planning poker is the most often used technique for estimating the size of user stories, but lately Team estimation game has been gaining popularity too, so emphasis was put on these two. An accuracy analysis of user story estimates based on data, collected during a study that was carried out at Software Engineering course in year 2014\/15, was performed. Design of the study and the process of collecting the data is described. The data was analysed using appropriate statistical methods and the results were explained in detail. The goal of the thesis was to find out how final estimates obtained through Planning poker differ from the statistical combination of the estimates obtained during the first round of the process and whether there is a statistically important difference between the estimates obtained through Planning poker and those obtained through TEG. Our analysis showed that Planning poker decreased the over-optimism present in the statistical combination of initial estimates. However, the size of effect was very small. Estimates obtained through TEG were even less optimistic than those obtained through Planning poker. Accuracy analysis of estimates showed no statistically significant difference.     Item Type:     Thesis (EngD thesis)     Keywords:     accuracy, agile software development, analysis, estimates, planning poker, scrum, team estimation game, user story "

Ena temeljnih usmeritev v procesu prenove je tudi procesno pojmovanje u\u00e8enja in pou\u00e8evanja, kar zahteva spremembo na\u00e8inov preverjanja in ocenjevanja znanja. Ugotavljamo, da se \u00bee v prvem razredu devetletke pojavljajo vse oblike preverjanja znanja. Kot kriterije preverjanja in ocenjevanja u\u00e8itelji in vzgojitelji navajajo samostojnost, ustvarjalnost, uporabo znanja v konkretnih situacijah in doseganje ciljev in standardov iz u\u00e8nih na\u00e8rtov. U\u00e8enci prvih razredov se preverjanja oz. ocenjevanja ne zavedajo in s tem niso obremenjeni.     ABSTRACT - At the formal level, the new curricula, laws and secondary legislation represent the starting points of the implementation of curricular restructuring into practice. They are all goal and process oriented. One of the main restructuring orientations is understanding learning and teaching as a process, which requires a change in the ways knowledge is evaluated and assessed. In the first grade of the nine-year primary school, all forms of knowledge assessment are present. The assessment criteria used by teachers and early years teachers are independence, creativity, application of knowledge into concrete situations and the achievement of curriculum goals and standards. As the first graders are not aware of being assessed, they do not experience it as a burden.     MEDSEBOJNI VPLIVI METOD POU\u00c8EVANJA IN OBLIKE PREVERJANJA ZNANJA PRI PREDMETU SPOZNAVANJE DRU\u00aeBE     INTERACTING EFFECTS OF TEACHING METHODS AND KNOWLEDGE ASSESSMENT FORMS WITHIN THE SUBJECT OF SOCIAL STUDIES     Izvirni znanstveni \u00e8lanek     Original scientific paper     UDK 371.3:371.26\/373.32:372.83     UDC 371.3:371.26\/373.32:372.83     DESKRIPTORJI: pou\u00e8evanje, avtenti\u00e8no preverjanje in ocenjevanje, u\u00e8ni na\u00e8rt, dru\u00beba, standard znanja     DESCRIPTORS: teaching, authentic evaluation and assessment, curriculum, society, knowledge standards     POVZETEK - Cilj \u00b9olanja bo pri u\u00e8encu dose\u00been takrat, ko bo le-ta s svojim znanjem znal gospodariti. Strokovnjaki se zato veliko ukvarjajo s sodobnimi oblikami in metodami pou\u00e8evanja, treba pa je prilagoditi tudi preverjanje in ocenjevanje. Sodobno preverjanje in ocenjevanje znanja se usmerja v tehni\u00e8no izpopolnjeni, objektivni model preverjanja in ocenjevanja ter v konstruktivno preverjanje in ocenjevanje. Avtorica je empiri\u00e8no prou\u00e8ila, kako u\u00e8itelji pou\u00e8ujejo, preverjajo in ocenjujejo pri predmetu spoznavanje dru\u00bebe in kaj v tej smeri ponuja u\u00e8ni na\u00e8rt. Ugotovila je, da u\u00e8itelji pou\u00e8ujejo po sodobnih metodah in oblikah dela, pri preverjanju in ocenjevanju pa se dr\u00beijo bolj preverjenih, tradicionalnih oblik.     ABSTRACT - The goal of schooling is achieved when the student is able to manage his knowledge successfully. To this end, experts are trying to develop modern teaching forms and methods while evaluation and assessment also have to be adapted. Modern evaluation and assessment are becoming a technically developed and objective model where knowledge can be evaluated and assessed in a constructive way. The author used the empirical method to show how teachers teach, evaluate and assess in the subject of social studies and also what is being offered in this connection by the curriculum. She established that while teachers were teaching according to modern teaching methods and forms, they preferred the more traditional approach when evaluating and assessing their students.     DESCRIPTORS: descriptive assessment, stage or mid-year records, learning and teaching doctrine     POVZETEK - Opisno ocenjevanje je oblika ocenjevanja, ki zahteva pri uvajanju precej napora u\u00e8iteljev in vseh drugih udele\u00beencev v vzgojno-izobra\u00beevalnem procesu. Ugotavljamo, da je opisno ocenjevanje nova oblika, ki lahko zelo dobro uresni\u00e8uje novo doktrino u\u00e8enja in pou\u00e8evanja. Za oblikovanje dobrih etapnih zapisov potrebujejo u\u00e8itelji veliko \u00e8asa, strokovni pristop in bogato profesionalno besedi\u00b9\u00e8e. Prav zaradi medletnega nastajanja se ti zapisi dobro vklju\u00e8ujejo v proces u\u00e8enja. Zaklju\u00e8ek ocenjevalnega obdobja je namre\u00e8 \u00e8as, ko u\u00e8enec in u\u00e8itelj naredita evalvacijo svojega dela in popravita morebitno napa\u00e8no za\u00e8rtano pot. S tem pa morajo biti seznanjeni tudi star\u00b9i.     ABSTRACT - Descriptive assessment is a form of assessment which requires extensive efforts on the part of teachers and all other participants in the educational process. Descriptive assessment is a new form of assessment in line with the new learning and teaching doctrine. For the development of appropriate stages, the teachers need a great deal of time, a professional approach and a rich professional vocabulary. Due to the midyear nature of these records, they can be successfully incorporated into the learning process. The completion of the assessment period is namely the time when the student and the teacher make an evaluation of their work and have the possibility to make corrections in case the path taken was not the right one. The process must be made known to the parents.     KON\u00c8NI ZAPISI POD DROBNOGLEDOM: ANALIZA OPISNIH OCEN Z VIDIKA BLOOMOVE TAKSONOMIJE     FINAL RECORDS UNDER CLOSE SCRUTINY: ANALYSIS OF DESCRIPTIVE GRADES FROM THE ASPECT OF BLOOM'S TAXONOMY     DESCRIPTORS: descriptive grades, descriptive assessment, educational goals, evaluation, school achievement, nine-year primary school     POVZETEK - Vpra\u00b9anje je, ali star\u00b9i resni\u00e8no realno razumejo, kolik\u00b9no je znanje otroka ob zaklju\u00e8ku \u00b9olskega leta, in koliko jim ti zapisi povedo, kje mora otrok \u00b9e dograditi in dopolniti svoje znanje. K razumevanju opisnih ocen pomembno prispevajo operativno izra\u00beeni u\u00e8ni cilji. V opisnih ocenah je pozornost sicer usmerjena h kon\u00e8nim, dose\u00beenim ciljem, vendar pa star\u00b9i \u00bee med \u00b9olskim letom spremljajo napredek in razvoj svojega otroka in so sproti obve\u00b9\u00e8eni o uspehih in u\u00e8nih te\u00beavah, zato opisna ocena ob zaklju\u00e8ku \u00b9olskega leta ni povsem nova in edina informacija. Opisna ocena je namenjena tudi u\u00e8itelju, ki bo otroka pou\u00e8eval v naslednjem \u00b9olskem letu.     ABSTRACT - It is questionable whether parents really and realistically understand the extent of their child's knowledge at the end of the school year. It is also a question to what degree the records reveal to them where the child has to upgrade and complement his\/her knowledge. Operationally expressed learning goals can essentially contribute to the understanding of descriptive grades where the attention is directed to the final goals that have been reached. Since parents track the progress and development of their child already during the school year and are thus constantly informed about his\/her achievement and learning difficulties, the descriptive grade at the end of the school year is neither completely new to them, nor is it the only information they receive. It is also of value to the teacher who will be teaching the child the following year.     DESCRIPTORS: evaluation and assessment of know-ledge, written test of knowledge, analysis, taxonomy stages, primary school, classroom lessons     POVZETEK - Preverjanje in ocenjevanje znanja kot sestavni del kurikuluma mora biti nujna, skrbno na\u00e8rtovana in kriti\u00e8no ovrednotena sestavina u\u00e8nega procesa. Prispevek obravnava pisne preizkuse znanja na stopnji razrednega pouka, analizirane z vidika taksonomskih stopenj. V empiri\u00e8nem delu analizira naklju\u00e8no izbrane pisne preizkuse znanja z vidika kognitivnih taksonomskih stopenj iz slovenskega jezika, matematike ter spoznavanja narave in dru\u00bebe od drugega do \u00e8etrtega razreda.     ABSTRACT - Evaluation and assessment of knowledge as a constituent part of the curriculum must be an essential, carefully planned and critically evaluated component of the learning process. The article presents written tests of knowledge at the classroom level, analysed from the aspect of taxonomy stages. The empirical part analyses randomly chosen written tests of knowledge from the aspect of cognitive taxonomy stages, from the subjects of Slovene language, mathematics, early science and social studies in grades two to four.     DESCRIPTORS: primary school, evaluation and assessment of knowledge, individual characteristics of students, adaptation of teachers     POVZETEK - U\u00e8iteljeva vloga pri spoznavanju u\u00e8encev in upo\u00b9tevanje individualnih posebnosti posameznih u\u00e8encev pri preverjanju in ocenjevanju znanja u\u00e8encev je zelo velika. U\u00e8itelj mora v najve\u00e8ji mo\u00beni meri upo\u00b9tevati individualne posebnosti posameznih u\u00e8encev, kar od njega zahteva veliko psiholo\u00b9kega in pedago\u00b9kega znanja, veliko sistemati\u00e8nega opazovanja u\u00e8encev ter pozornega in odgovornega na\u00e8rtovanja preverjanja znanja. \u00c8lanek s pregledom teoreti\u00e8nih spoznanj in z ugotovitvami iz prakse obravnava razlike u\u00e8encev v sposobnostih in znanju, razlike v kognitivnem stilu ter razli\u00e8ne sposobnosti u\u00e8encev za ustno oz. pisno izra\u00beanje znanja. Prika\u00bee nam, kako se na\u00b9tetim razlikam v procesu preverjanja in ocenjevanja znanja tudi prilagajamo.     ABSTRACT - In learning about the students and in taking into account their individual characteristics when assessing their knowledge, the teacher's role is enormous. In order to be able to do this, s\/he must possess good psychological and pedagogical know-ledge, must observe his\/her students systematically and must plan assessment in a careful and responsible way. The article offers a review of theoretical knowledge and findings from practice, treats the differences of students in their abilities and knowledge, differences in cognitive styles and different abilities as to their oral or written expression. We can see how, in the process of evaluation and assessment of knowledge, the teacher adapts to these differences.     AVTENTI\u00c8NE OBLIKE DELA TER PREVERJANJA IN OCENJEVANJA     AUTHENTIC TEACHING APPROACHES, EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT     UDK 371.26:373.32\/.34     UDC 371.26:373.32\/.34     DESKRIPTORJI: avtenti\u00e8ne oblike dela, preverjanje in ocenjevanje, u\u00e8itelj, u\u00e8enec, anketa     DESCRIPTORS: authentic teaching approaches, evaluation and assessment, teacher, student, survey     POVZETEK - V \u00e8lanku smo opredelili pojma avtenti\u00e8ne oblike dela pri pouku ter avtenti\u00e8no preverjanje in ocenjevanje znanja. Navedli smo nekaj oblik dela, za katere predvidevamo, da jih u\u00e8itelji pri pouku najpogosteje uporabljajo. Zanimalo nas je, katere so oblike, s katerimi bi tak\u00b9no pou\u00e8evanje lahko tudi preverjali in ocenjevali. U\u00e8itelje razredne in predmetne stopnje smo povpra\u00b9ali, katere oblike prakti\u00e8nega dela uporabljajo pri pouku, kako pogosto in na kak\u00b9en na\u00e8in preverjajo in ocenjujejo pridobljeno znanje. Menimo, da je treba razmisliti o avtenti\u00e8nih oblikah preverjanja in ocenjevanja in se vpra\u00b9ati, ali res pripomorejo h kvalitetnej\u00b9emu u\u00e8enju in znanju.     ABSTRACT - The article defines the concepts of authentic teaching approaches and authentic evaluation and assessment of knowledge. It lists some of the approaches the teachers apply most frequently. We were interested in the forms of evaluation and assessment that would be most appropriate for those approaches. The classroom and subject teachers were asked about the methods of practical work they used in their lessons, how frequently and in what way they evaluated and assessed the acquired knowledge. We believe that authentic forms of evaluation and assessment would need to be implemented, and then we could see whether they really contribute to better learning and knowledge.     POVZETEK - Nova doktrina preverjanja in ocenjevanja te\u00bei tudi k bolj avtenti\u00e8nim oblikam preverjanja in ocenjevanja, med katere \u00b9tejemo tudi portfolio. V prispevku predstavljamo na\u00e8rtovanje portfolia, njegovo izvajanje, uporabo ter vrednotenje. Raziskave v tujini so pokazale njegove prednosti in pomanjkljivosti, pa tudi te\u00beave, s katerimi se soo\u00e8ajo u\u00e8itelji, ki so portfolio vpeljali v svoj sistem pou\u00e8evanja. V zad-njih letih pa se je portfolio uveljavil tudi v slovenskem \u00b9olskem prostoru skupaj z opisnim ocenjevanjem.     ABSTRACT - The new evaluation and assessment doctrine is focussed on more authentic evaluation and assessment approaches, portfolio being one of them. The article presents portfolio planning, its implementation, application and evaluation. The research from abroad shows its advantages and deficiencies, as well as the difficulties faced by teachers implementing portfolio into their teaching system. Together with descriptive assessment, portfolio is gaining in importance in Slovene schools.     POVZETEK - Nove na\u00e8ine preverjanja in ocenjevanja pogosto spremlja tudi samoocenjevanje, kjer u\u00e8ence spodbujamo k spoznavanju lastnih kognitivnih procesov. U\u00e8enec ni pozoren le na kon\u00e8ne rezultate, temve\u00e8 tudi na to, kako se je u\u00e8il - na sam proces. Raziskava je pokazala, da se u\u00e8enci samoocenjevanja v vlogi formativnega preverjanja dokaj hitro navadijo. Zelo so kriti\u00e8ni in osredoto\u00e8eni predvsem na pomanjkljivosti pri svojem delu, medtem ko se jim zdijo pomembnej\u00b9i lastni dose\u00beki. Ugotavljamo, da lahko \u00bee ve\u00e8ina prvo\u00b9olcev kriti\u00e8no ocenjuje.     ABSTRACT - New evaluation and assessment approaches are frequently accompanied by self-evaluation, where students are encouraged to become aware of their cognitive processes. The students do not only focus on their end results but also on how they actually learned - on the process itself. The research showed that students quite rapidly become used to self-assessment as formative evaluation. They are very critical and focus predominantly on the deficiencies in their work and are mostly concerned with their own achievements. We have established that the majority of first-graders are capable of critical assessment.     POVZETEK - Preverjanje in ocenjevanje znanja je sestavni del u\u00e8nega procesa. Obenem pa je tudi zelo ob\u00e8utljiva tema, ki nemalokrat spro\u00bei mnogo polemik in razprav. Postavljajo se vpra\u00b9anja, kot so, kdaj preverjati in kdaj ocenjevati, kolikokrat dnevno, tedensko, kak\u00b9ni naj bodo kriteriji, naj bo notranje ali zunanje... Premalokrat pa se vpra\u00b9amo, kaj ob vsem tem \u00e8utijo tisti, ki so v ta proces najbolj vklju\u00e8eni - u\u00e8enci. Kako lahko u\u00e8itelj pomaga u\u00e8encem, da jim preverjanje in ocenjevanje ne bi ve\u00e8 predstavljalo stresne situacije, ali pa bi jo vsaj omilil? Pri vsem tem ima velik vpliv komunikacija - verbalna in neverbalna.     ABSTRACT - Evaluation and assessment of know-ledge is a constituent part of the learning process. At the same time, this is a very sensitive topic which triggers frequent controversies and discussions. Thus questions arise as to when to evaluate and when to assess, how frequently within one day, one week, what the criteria should be, should evaluation and assessment be intrinsic or extrinsic in nature... But we frequently ignore those who are most involved in this process - the students. How can the teacher help his\/her students so as not to experience these processes as stressful situations, or at least to a lesser degree. In this connection verbal and non-verbal communication play an important role.     ANALYSIS OF THE RULES ABOUT KNOWLEDGE EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF STUDENTS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL     POVZETEK - S prenovo osnovne \u00b9ole se prenavlja tudi preverjanje in ocenjevanje v njej. Nekatere novosti se uvajajo tudi s Pravilnikom o preverjanju in ocenjevanju znanja ter napredovanju u\u00e8encev v osnovni \u00b9oli. Zanimalo me je, kako se na \u00b9oli, kjer pou\u00e8ujem upo\u00b9teva ta Pravilnik. O tem sem povpra\u00b9ala u\u00e8ence 7. razreda in pregledala tri zapisnike rednih in\u00b9pekcijskih nadzorov, ki so bili opravljeni na osnovnih \u00b9olah v Ljubljani ter primerjala njihove ugotovitve s skladnostjo Pravilnika.     ABSTRACT - Restructuring primary school also implies restructuring evaluation and assessment methods. Some of the novelties are being implemented also through the Rules about Knowledge Evaluation and Assessment and Advancement of Students in Primary School. In order to see how these rules are observed in my school, I asked the seventh-graders and examined three protocols of regular inspection visits that had been performed in the Ljubljana primary schools. I studied how their findings matched the Rules. "

        "text":" Gimnazija Kranj was established in year 1810 and is one of the oldest and most respected schools in Slovenia. Every year we perform above average results in the national examination (matura) at the end of grade 12 and at knowledge or skills contests on the national and international level. Gimnazija Kranj is a four-year grammar school (gymnasium) enroling 1.000 students from 15 to 18 years old, who had above average results at the primary school.     In natural sciences especially in physics and mathematics our school is one of the strongest schools in the country.     Table comparing achievements at the national examination session (matura) in Slovenia (SLO) and at Gimnazija Kranj (GK) from 2001 onwards:     Our students are accepted at best university programmes in Slovenia and perform excellent results in all scientific fields especially in natural sciences. More than 80 per cent of our students are admitted to their first-choice university.     IB Diploma Programme at Gimnazija Kranj     The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) was started in the 1960s by a group of international educators in Geneva, Switzerland. With the goal of transcending political borders; providing a \u201cgeneral education with specialization;\u201d and creating a universally recognized diploma, the first United World College, Atlantic College, was founded. Atlantic College served as a model for the framework of the IBDP, and soon thereafter, other United World Colleges were founded all over the world - with the IBDP as their central curriculum - and the programme began being adopted by high schools as well. Harlan Hanson, one of the IBDP\u2019s founders, stated that the goal of the IB Diploma was to, \u201cprovide an internationally acceptable university admissions qualification suitable for the growing mobile population of young people whose parents were part of the world of diplomacy, international and multi-national organizations.\u201d     The unique structure of the curriculum     More important than the IBDP\u2019s unique international recognition and esteem among educators and universities is how the curriculum is actually structured and how the students work within the programme. In an intense two-year period, students take six subjects, of which a minimum of three must be taken at the higher level (HL) and the rest at the standard level (SL). In this regard, students concentrate on and receive specialization in subjects far beyond what they would be able to do in normal high school classes. In addition, unique to the IBDP are the three additional requirements for students to obtain the diploma: Extended Essay (EE), which is a 4000 word independent research essay, which is completed in one of the six subjects; Theory of Knowledge (TOK), which is a class dedicated to the understanding of how one obtains and processes knowledge, and includes a final essay and presentation; and lastly, Creativity, Action, Service (CAS), which stresses community and social service and physical activity as means to grow and mature as an individual and productive member of society.     The IB learner profile     With the IBDP requirements in mind, it\u2019s worth noting what kind of student is most suitable for enrollment in this program. On the surface, of course an exemplary academic record and proven ability to handle a large academic workload are necessary. But the IB learner\u2019s profile stresses above all open-minded thinking and inquiry; reflection and communication; intellectual, emotional, and physical balance; and the ability to take risks, but also defend one\u2019s beliefs and principles. Howard Gardner of Harvard University summed up these ideas by saying that IB students \u201cthink critically, synthesize knowledge, reflect on their own thought processes and get their feet wet in interdisciplinary thinking.\u201d     Gimnazija Kranj on board     Gimnazija Kranj was approved for the IBDP by an international committee in 2009, and began with the first IBDP class in the fall of 2010. On a weekly basis, the IBDP students engage in social projects in and around the community of Kranj for their CAS requirements, and work independently with faculty mentors on their EEs. The school is excited about how quickly the programme has taken off, and how enthusiastically the students and teachers have embraced these new learning and teaching efforts.     Syllabus The IB Diploma Programme is a two-year course. Students can choose six subjects from six groups. At least three or four subjects must be taken at higher HL and the rest at standard SL level.     Mother Tangue - Slovene     Group 2: Language B     English, German, French, Spanish     Mathematics     Subject chosen from groups 2, 3 or 4. We don't offer the Arts.     The academic year starts on September 1st and ends in May after the external exams.

Z rudarskim pozdravom \u00bbsre\u010dno\u00ab smo se poslovili od Idrije in se odpravili proti \u0160kofji Loki. Na poti smo videli dvorec Visoko, kjer je Ivan Tav\u010dar \u00bbmed gorami\u00ab raziskoval zgodovino dru\u017eine Khallan in napisal Viso\u0161ko kroniko ter ustvaril \u0161e veliko drugih literarnih del. Nato smo prispeli v \u0160kofjo Loko. Ogledali smo si muzej, ki je v gradu (spominski sobi Tav\u010darja in impresionista Groharja, idrijsko in lo\u0161ko obrt \u2026), in se sprehodili po srednjeve\u0161kem mestu. Tako je na\u0161a ekskurzija minila. V ve\u010dernih urah, \u0161e pred \u00bbnoh\u0161ihtam\u00ab, smo se vrnili domov. Na\u0161im \u00bbplaumoharjem\u00ab pa je lahko \u017eal, da niso bili z nami.

        "text":" Zdravo ,imam fiat grande punto 2006 1.3 multijet, problem je da se mi ob\u0107asno med vo\u017enjo ugasnejo lu\u010di, zamejal sem obvolanske komande kjer se pri\u017egejo lu\u010di ampak ni ni\u010d bolj\u0161e.     Poglej varovalke, \u010de ima\u0161 morebiti kako osmojeno, jaz sem ravno zadnji\u010d eno tako na\u0161el ampak za \u0161tevec.     si pogledal tudi varovalke pod armaturo? Ker tam je varovalka za \u0161tevec, pri men je bila malo skurjena F53 ali F37, ena izmed teh dveh je za \u0161tevec.     Zdravo, a to misli\u0161 tam tista \u0161katla ki je pri motorju...?     Ne, na levi strani pod stikalom za meglenke je en tak prokrovcek ki ga potenes proti sebi in potem je tam se en priklop za canbus, za njem so pa te varovalke     Last week, much to my annoyance, all four tail lights of my Grade Punto failed to illuminate and the dash board display reported \"Check running lights\" every time the light switch was turned on. The two front side lights were working along with the rear number plate lights, the three rear brake lights, the reversing lamp and rear fog lamp so it wasn't a general electrical problem.     I dismantled and checked the cable connections to each rear light cluster expecting to find a loose connector somewhere. They all appeared fine and the fact that the indicator lights and brake lights worked demonstrated that the majority of connections were in place, including the ground. The tail lights on the GP are fed by two circuits from the body computer with two 5w lamps connected to each. The lower 5w lamp is half of the combined tail(5w)\/stop light(21W) bulb.     I finished up my first diagnosis session by re plugging the connectors to the body computer and retiring to consider the circuit diagrams.     My next step was to connect my trusty Actron ODB II reader to the ODB port, but which, unfortunately revealed nothing. Then I tried using PCMSCAN from a laptop but unfortunately it didn't recognise the Body Computer so consequently couldn't display any body computer specific information.     At this point I abandoned the diagnosis and took the car into my local FIAT dealer. They diagnosed a failed Body computer and estimated the cost to replace at approx \u00a3400. Wow! It looked as if it would cost me \u00a3400 to fix four non working tail lights. Not a great thought. Looking at the wiring diagrams it looks as if the Body Computer in central to virtually all the electrical circuits in the vehicle. Having a \u00a3400 body computer as the weak link in even the most basic of electrical circuits doesn't seem too bright.     Having a few hours free I started looking for ways to bodge a connection from the rear fog lamp to the tail lights. By sheer good fortune something I did caused the tail lights to come on for a few seconds. Perhaps there was a chance to fix the fault after all. The lights came on just after I moved the steering column adjuster. I remembered that the last time I drove the car I had discovered that the steering column also moves back and forward as well as up and down and I had adjusted the position. Removing the steering column covers revealed the movement had trapped part of the wiring loom, the looms retaining clip not being fixed correctly to its mounting. However, re-arranging and checking the cables did not fix the problem.     Just before beginning to patch the tail light wiring into the fog lamp I tried removing bulbs from the tail light circuits. My theory was that this would put less load on the circuit, perhaps allowing the body computer to supply sufficient current. When I removed the combined tail light\/stop light all the other lamps came on. Hurrah I'd found the problem!     It turns out that the combined tail\/stop light had an internal short between the 5w and the 21w filament. This had put a load of 21w plus (3 x 5w) on the tail light circuit, presumably causing the body computer electrics to overload.     Also, when it was quiet I noticed that the body computer made an unusual sound when I turned the side lights on. It was a small hissing noise, which I would associate with a small electric coil. It only lasted a couple of seconds before disappearing. Once I had replaced the bulb the body computer stopped making the noise.     Good job!     Now, what choice words can I use when I go back to speak with the service manager at the FIAT garage. Can they really not diagnose a faulty rear light bulb?     \u0161e vedno nisem uspel najti napake zakaj se mi ob\u010dasno ugasnejo lu\u010di med vo\u017enjo, ugasnejo se mi vse lu\u010di, kot na armaturi ter zunaj na avtu..     za koliko casa ti ugasnejo? punca ma namrec na grande puntotu enake tezave (luci se vgasnejo in spet prizgejo za slabo sekundo)     za koliko casa ti ugasnejo? punca ma namrec na grande puntotu enake tezave (luci se vgasnejo in spet prizgejo za slabo sekundo)     Xin, se to med vo\u017enjo?

        "text":" You are browsing the archived website of 45th Week of Slovenian Drama - to visit current website, click here.     About the performance     PREMI\u00c8RE GLEJ THEATRE, 27 JANUARY 2014 THE PERFORMANCE IS 3 HOURS LONG AND HAS ONE INTERVAL     \"today, as i become a pioneer, i'm giving my pioneer word of honour that i will follow the example of the best pioneers, that i'll respect the glorious deeds of the partisans and the progressive people of the world who wish freedom and peace.\"     Born in the beginning of the 1980s, they were the last generation of pioneers. Those born before that remember to this day the pioneers\u2019 oath and the ideals that it carried. History, though, went another way. In the story, set in a small town in the timespan of three decades, the moral emptiness of today\u2019s consumerist world is faced with the ideologised past and poses the question whether the past was necessary and is the future really open. Where are the dinar and the para? Where are La\u010dni Franz, Blondie, Abba, AC\/DC, Haustor? What is 2013? What are we fighting for in 2013? What are we striving for? What are we building? What do we believe in? What do we value? What are we sharing? Which world is better? The one we live it, the one we lived in or the one that\u2019s coming? Simona Semeni\u010d\u2019s play was nominated for the Grum Award at last year\u2019s Week of Slovenian Drama. \"The gap that opened between the spirit of our time, marked by calculations, materialism and corporative logic, and the past spirit of the approximate of the socialist society, is accentuated in directing by (re) mixing, cuts, and transitions \u2013 more glimpses than developed situations, more sketches than finished images. And because of this approach, we\u2019ll remember this performance.\" (Nenad Jelesijevi\u0107, rtvslo.si)     Photo gallery     Our site uses cookies for social networks connections, better overall site performance and awesome user experience.

Du\u0161evnost je abstrakten pojem, ki ga bitje pripisuje odzivom na dra\u017eljaje v telesu (ob\u010dutenja) in v okolju (\u010dustvovanja) s pomo\u010djo mi\u0161ljenja (vzro\u010dno \u2013 posledi\u010dna povezovanja pojavov v dogodke). V tem pogledu je du\u0161evnost relacijski in virtualen pojav subjektivne realnosti. Ljudje se du\u0161evnost lahko tudi zavedamo s pomo\u010djo metafori\u010dnega jezika in z njim oblikujemo teorijo o du\u0161evnosti, tako lastni kot drugih bitij.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

        "text":" The Hamar people are the largest and ethnologically strongest group living by the Omo riverside. The most interesting part of their culture is the initiation ceremony for young boys called \u201cbull jumping\u201d. I myself was a spectator of numerous of these ceremonies and each and every time I was surprised, how so many unmarried girls would willingly take part in these ceremonies. The unmarried boys in these ceremonies whip the unmarried girls, if they wish it, on their backs and blood just comes pouring out like in fountains. The boys just stand there and watch them, without even a liny blink of an eye. Unbelievable...     The Mursi people are said to be the most feisty and even most wild Omo riverside population. But even the feistiness of these people won\u2019t help, when the river will be much drier, thanks to the newly build hydroelectric power plants and cotton fields that will occupy most of the water supplies of their river. They don\u2019t even suspect, what awaits them. The Mursi people still look from above when they see visitors and tourist, even though these became their main and only serious source of income. But how long will this last?     The small Arbore people live on an equally very small-scaled region, some kilometers away from the Omo River, which makes them fare more water independent than most of the other living cultures in this region. Even now, they are used to heavy droughts and rely on underwater water supplies from wells. But with the drastic sinking of the Omo River water supply, even the underwater supplies of the life giving river will become much scarcer.

        "text":" Pierre Mechain was born on August 16, 1744 in Laon. He was son of an architect, and originally wanted to follow his father in a career in architecture. He studied math and physics, but due to financial difficulties left college. For some time, he worked as a tutor. Then he became friend of Jerome de Lalande, who let him proof-read parts of his book \"L'Astronomie\". In 1772, Lalande obtained a position for Mechain as assistant hydrographer at the Depot of Maps and Charts of the Navy in Versailles. In the beginning, this was only a temporary position, and Mechain was forced to get additional income from teaching mathematics.     In 1774, Mechain obtained the more permanent post as a calculator with the Depot of the Navy. At that time, he has met Charles Messier, who worked for the same department, but at the small observatory at Hotel de Cluny. Apparently, the two astronomers became friends around this time.     On the new post, Mechain was first involved in surveys of the French coastline. In addition, he had occasion to make some observations at Versailles. In 1774, he observed an occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon, which he later presented as a memoir to the Academy of Sciences.     Like Messier, Pierre Mechain became much devoted to comet observing and hunting. Also like Messier, he soon started to stumble over nebulous objects, and between 1779 and 1782, discovered the considerable number of 30 deep sky objects, 29 of which were original firsts. As apparently he had got in close cooperation with Charles Messier at that time, he almost instantly communicated his observations to Charles Messier, who usually checked their positions and added them to his catalog. Both astronomers undertook a vigorous effort to find more nebulae between late August 1780 and March 1781, when the manuscript for the final version of the Messier catalog was sent out to print. Mechain's last two contributions, M102 and M103, went into the publication unchecked and without positions.     Four additional findings of Mechain missed the publication; these are now known as M104, M105, M106, and M107. He communicated them to Bernoulli, the editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch, in a letter dated May 6, 1783. As these four objects were not contained in the original Messier catalog, they were longly attributed separately to Pierre Mechain (e.g. by John Herschel and J.L.E. Dreyer, the author of the NGC). In this same letter, Mechain disclaimed - possibly in error - his discovery of M102 as an erroneous re-observation of M101, thereby initiating a still open discussion on the identity of this object.     Mechain discovered his first two comets in 1781, and because of his mathematical skills, he was able to calculate their orbits. He was made a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1782. A third comet followed in 1785, and in 1786, he discovered another one which later became famous as \"Comet Encke\" (after the calculater of its orbit, the German astronomer J.F. Encke). Comet Encke was later independently rediscovered by Caroline Herschel in 1792 and by Pons in 1805, and is the shortest-periodic comet ever discovered, with a period of 3.5 years.     In 1786, Pierre Mechain became an associate editor of the Connaissance des Temps, the journal which had e.g. published the Messier Catalog - one year after Charles Messier had been appointed for the same job.     In 1787, Mechain collaborated with J.D. Cassini and Legendre on measuring the acurate longitude difference between Paris and Greenwich. All three visited William Herschel at his observatory in Slough in the same year.     Mechain discovered his fifth comet in the same year, 1787. His next, 6th discovery occurred in 1790; this finding was periodic comet Tuttle with a period of 13.75 years, as recognized by Tuttle in 1858.     In 1791, a project was initiated of a new survey of the meridian from Dunkirk to Barcelona, and Mechain undertook the southern part, together with an assistant, Tranchot. The operation started June 25, 1792, suffering from various difficulties caused by the French revolution: At one time, Mechain and Tranchot got arrested by revolutioneers in Essone, who first mistook their instruments as weapons, but later let them proceed.     When in Spain, Mechain got hurt in an accident, and when he had recovered, war had broken out between France and Spain, and he got interned. Nevertheless, he discovered another comet, his 7th, from Barcelona on January 10, 1793. During the terror regime in Paris, while Mechain himself was away, all of his property got lost, and his family suffered greatly. Mechain was eventually allowed to leave Spain for Italy, where he stayed at Genoa for some time, and returned to Paris finally in 1795.     On his return, he bacame member of the new Academy of Sciences, and the Bureau of Longitudes. Moreover, he was made director of the Paris Observatory, where he discovered his 8th and last comet on December 26, 1799; Messier took part in observing this one in order to obtain its orbit.     Apparently, Mechain was concerned about the quality of the results of his survey, and refused to publish them for a long time. Eventually, he got permission from Napoleon to extend the survey, and left Paris in 1803.     After completing part of this work, Pierre Mechain caught yellow fever and died in Castillion de la Plana in Spain on September 20, 1804.     Mechain originally discovered 29 deepsky objects, all of which are contained in the modern-version Messier catalog, plus 4 independent co-discoveries; of these he disclaimed one (M102). The four objects which missed the original publication of the Messier catalog, M104, M105, M106, and M107 were eventually added by Camille Flammarion in 1921 (M104) and Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947; the two mentioned with M97 (M108 and M109) by Owen Gingerich in 1953.

        "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     FAQs in connection with the Emergency Deferral of Borrowers\u2019 Liabilities Act (ZIUOPOK)     04\/07\/2020 \/ Press release     The Emergency Deferral of Borrowers\u2019 Liabilities Act (ZIUOPOK) was adopted at the proposal of the government. Its exact manner of implementation is a business decision for the commercial banks. To help borrowers, the Bank of Slovenia has drawn up answers to a number of frequently asked questions, in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance, which drafted the new law. For any more detailed questions, please contact the ministry.     1. What credit liabilities are covered by the ZIUOPOK? Are leasing and payment account overdrafts included?     The ZIUOPOK does not define what constitutes a credit agreement for which the deferral of payment of liabilities may be requested. Other regulations are therefore of relevance in answering this question: general credit agreements are regulated by the Obligations Act (the ZOR), while consumer credit agreements are regulated by the Consumer Credit Act (the ZPotK-2). According to the ZPotK-2, consumer finance leases or leasing and overdraft facilities in consumer payment accounts are also defined as consumer credit agreements. Thus there is no bar to banks approving (for business entities and consumers alike) the deferral of the payment of liabilities for other types of banking product not falling under the definition of a credit agreement under Article 1065 of the ZOR or the ZPotK-2, in accordance with their internal rules.     2. Does the law apply to leasing companies?     No. The ZIUOPOK does not apply to leasing companies, but only to banks and savings banks established in Slovenia, and branches of Member State banks established in Slovenia.     3. Does the law also apply to corporate bonds?     No. The deferral measure set out by the ZIUOPOK applies solely to liabilities under credit agreements.     4. Does the ZIUOPOK apply to customers who are resident in Slovenia but who are not Slovenian nationals?     No. The ZIUOPOK does not apply to such people.     5. Can the bank and the borrower agree on a shorter or longer deferral period?     Yes. The bank and the borrower may agree a shorter or longer period for deferring the payment of liabilities under a credit agreement if this is better for the borrower and if the borrower so requests. They may also agree on other details of the payment deferral. Agreements of this type are also classed as measures concluded on the basis of the emergency law.     6. Can the bank charge costs for the deferral? Can the deferral be tied to other conditions?     The law has no provisions relating to the costs of approving the deferral and concluding the annex to the credit agreement, and therefore there is no legal basis for prohibiting the charging of any fees that might be set by banks in their standard price list for processing requests for the deferral of payment of liabilities under credit agreements. We do however call on commercial banks to make any fees charged for processing requests for payment deferrals reasonable and based on actual costs, as the purpose of the ZIUOPOK is not to use these extraordinary circumstances to boost non-interest income. The content of the annex is the result of the expression of the free intention of the two contracting parties. However, any further unreasonable requirements by the bank that result in (eligible) payment deferrals not actually taking place are contrary to the law. In extreme cases the Bank of Slovenia may as the supervisor rule that a bank that fails to approve the deferral of the payment of liabilities under a credit agreement for a borrower who has cited substantiated grounds and has demonstrably met the conditions has committed a misdemeanour under the ZIUOPOK.     7. How is the size of instalment payments addressed? How is interest charged? When does the deferred interest fall due for payment?     The updated Article 5 of the ZIUOPOK unambiguously stipulates that the borrower is deferred to pay both the outstanding principal and the interest payment, while interest continues to accrue at the ordinary interest rate agreed when the credit agreement was concluded, but does not become payable at the time of the deferral. The borrower is not obliged to pay interest at the time of deferral, but interests are nevertheless calculated, so the annex to the loan agreement stipulates how the bank and the borrower will repay them after the deferral is completed. The regular payment of interest during the deferral period can be agreed at the borrower\u2019s request. Other arrangements would entail a partial write-off of the borrower\u2019s liabilities, which is not the purpose of the law.     8. What happens after the deferral ends?     After the end of the deferral period, the first deferred instalment falls due for payment 12 months later than was agreed in the original credit agreement. This means that the payment of each liability is deferred by 12 months. For example, if the individual liabilities fell due for payment on 30 June 2020, 30 September 2020, 31 December 2020 and 31 March 2021, after the deferral they will fall due on 30 June 2021, 30 September 2021, 31 December 2021 and 31 March 2022. However, the borrower and the bank may agree on a deadline for payment of the liabilities that is more favourable to the borrower.     9. How does the extension of loan collateral work?     The ZIUOPOK stipulates that the term of the contract that serves as collateral for the credit agreement is also extended for the duration of the payment deferral.     10. What if the borrower meets all the conditions for deferral under the emergency law, except that individual liabilities under the credit agreement fell due for payment before 12 March 2020 and have not been paid?     Individual liabilities under a credit agreement that had not fallen due for payment by the time of the declaration of the epidemic are subject to deferral, while individual liabilities under the same credit agreement that fell due for payment before the declaration of the epidemic are not subject to deferral under the ZIUOPOK. The deferral of liabilities not covered by the ZIUOPOK, such as liabilities that fell due for payment before 12 March 2020, may also be agreed with the borrower by the bank at any time. The bank may not condition the deferral of non-past-due liabilities on the payment of liabilities that fell due for payment before 12 March 2020.     11. Who submits the declaration that as at 31 December 2019 the borrower had settled all past-due liabilities from mandatory taxes, social security contributions and other levies?     Borrowers submit their own declarations, enclosing the relevant confirmation from their tax office.     12. How do individuals provide arguments and evidence for their inability to repay liabilities under a credit agreement with a bank?     The ZIUOPOK does not prescribe a specific application or request for deferral of payment, and it is therefore a matter of agreement between bank and borrower. This applies both to the submission of the declaration, and the definition of the more detailed content and evidence that the bank will take into account when approving a request. In so doing the bank must remain within the legal framework, and may not set unreasonable requirements for borrowers.     13. Does the ZIUOPOK also apply to credit agreements that are newly concluded or approved while the law is in force?     Yes, the ZIUOPOK also applies in these cases, if the borrower decides to take advantage of the options offered by the law. However, in this case too the borrower must be able to argue that repayment of the liabilities has been made impossible by the novel coronavirus epidemic, unless the borrower\u2019s business activities have been prohibited by government or municipal ordinance. This does not mean that the bank automatically approves new credit. But insofar as credit is approved, the customer is automatically entitled to a deferral in the case of an ordinance of the aforementioned type. "

        "text":" What an entrepreneur needs to know about marketing     What an entrepreneur needs to know about marketing     06.05.2008 ob 09:53     Marketing can be compared to football \u2013 within the comfort of one\u2019s sofa, everyone is the expert, noticing every mistake, foreseeing every move. On the football field, however, there is a completely different story \u2013 the field is too big and therefore obscured, we cannot even see all the players and the opposing team, the competition, is on the lookout for our every mistake. Similar situations play out in the world of marketing when we decide to realise that first action. It is then that we find that matters are not so simple and obvious. If we embark upon it unprepared and with insufficient knowledge, the worst case scenario is that there is no response to the product and the money invested in the development and realization of the action has been practically thrown away. Another alternative is to hire professionals to carry out the action, which of course costs money but increases effect and response. What is Marketing Marketing means action: action directed towards acquiring clients, increasing sales, improving the recognition of the company, its products and its services etc. The victors in marketing are always the ones with the most forcible and effective ideas, the bolder ones, but also the more qualified\/educated. You should therefore think in terms of concrete action, using modern and innovative marketing approaches. Marketing aims at attracting attention, whether to the company products or its services. It represents a network of activities performed by the company and its employees, especially in smaller companies where practically every employee is a salesman. Irrespective of their workplace, everyone can all contribute to an action\u2019s success. Marketing therefore consists of everything that an entrepreneur does on the market \u2013 from the presentation of all documents, invoices, records, and complete business correspondence, to contacts with the buyers, suppliers, partners, potential employees, journalists, and politicians. The entrepreneur is the one responsible for presenting to his or her employees their role in the company\u2019s marketing activities: how to behave and primarily explaining what the goal is that the entrepreneur wishes to realise on the market. Only this will allow each company member to fulfil their role correctly. Unless the company\u2019s reputation and recognition is developed systematically, it may happen that the image on the market differs completely from your wishes and plans. The goal of every marketing strategy is a long-term increase of sales; however, there are differences in the marketing of small and big companies. For a small company, the first challenge is establishing a contact with potential buyers as directly and effectively as possible and, if possible, at the lowest possible price. The marketing of big companies or those companies marketing wholesale products, is usually more dispersed, while the most effective way for small companies is to achieve specifically set goals in a more direct and forcible way. What Marketing is Not Marketing does not in any way imply lying, manipulating or selling castles in the clouds only to convince the buyer to buy, even if it is done once and never again. If you know of at least one \u201cmiracle product\u201d that has not lived up to its TV or newspaper advertisement, you will agree that dissatisfied buyers are the worst kind of publicity for the product, the services or the deceitful company in general. And in addition ... Apart from all the above mentioned, it is important to remember the fact that in the midst of all this flood of advertisements in post boxes, on television, radio, and the Internet, people are becoming ever more selective. We simply overlook, we choose not to hear, or we turn off the advertisements. The advertisers have made the same conclusion, which is evident from television commercials where after they have been run there is another, more expensive one. The buyers\u2019 attention should be captivated by the form, as well as the content; the advertisement should awaken their interest and offer some kind of an advantage. This is the only way they will choose to dial your telephone number from the mass of advertisements.     Prosimo vas, da pri pisanju komentarjev niste \u017ealjivi.

        "text":" Dr Janez Drnov\u00b9ek: Some Good May Come Of The Uproar Over Austria     Published in European Affairs, Volume 1, No3, Summer 2000, European Institute (\u00e8lanek je v angle\u00b9kem jeziku)     The entry into the Austrian government of the extreme right Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider provoked controversy throughout Europe this spring. The hasty reaction of Austria's 14 partners in the European Union, who decided to freeze bilateral political relations with Vienna, was applauded by some, criticized by others. Some of the 14 countries are now having second thoughts. What is actually happening in Austria and in Europe? Are fundamental European democratic values under threat? Is what has happened in Austria so special and dramatic as to have warranted the EU's unprecedented response? For some, the Freedom Party represents a step backwards, reminiscent of the events that occurred before and during World War II. The first question is whether 27 per cent of the Austrian electorate supported Haider because of statements he has made about National Socialism, which he later corrected or denied, or because of his hostile attitude towards foreigners and minorities? Many political parties are in trouble Judging by the reaction of politicians in the other 14 countries, one might think that this is exactly what they did, and that there is a danger that these retrograde tendencies will gain ascendancy in Austria and spread to other European countries. That could present a grave danger to the EU and to its democratic development and stability. Critics say that Austrians have never fully come to terms with Nazism and World War II. If this is the case, the warnings of the international community would be fully justified. Many others, however, believe that the Freedom Party achieved its electoral success above all because of the weaknesses of the two traditional governing parties, which had failed to prevent the rise of right-wing populism. More than anything, it would appear that Haider exploited the political and bureaucratic inertia of the Austrian establishment, successfully challenging it with populist rhetoric. A substantial number of voters were perhaps taking a stand against political inertia and incompetence rather than supporting a clearly defined political alternative. Although the two major political parties in Austria had secured solid progress and a relatively high standard of living for the country during their long period in power, they also allowed a lack of political motivation to grow. The sharing out of political and official positions between the two parties, the constant battling for every millimetre of influence and the occasional political scandals allowed room for dissatisfaction and exasperation to develop. Perhaps it is on this point that the reaction of Europe's politicians is even more understandable. There may be a conscious or unconscious fear of similar populist exploitation of political paralysis in other European countries. Many traditional European parties are in difficulty, shaken by corruption scandals, often rigid and perhaps incapable of adapting to people's expectations and demands. The European institutions in Brussels are themselves under increasing pressure as demands grow for improved transparency and efficiency. They, too, could be subject to populist attacks in the future. In many places European citizens have a sense of alienation, not only from their national governments but also, and more particularly, from Brussels. A revolt against outmoded and paralysed political parties and structures that was xenophobic, intolerant and retrograde on the one hand, and anti-bureaucratic and populist on the other, could be very dangerous. Perhaps it is precisely this that so alarmed Europe's politicians when the Austrians voted in their new government. It seems almost as if Europe needed a Haider because of the accumulated domestic fears in certain European countries. And, in the end, it is no longer important what Haider says or does today. Europe has already responded to his populism in a populist manner. Just as right-wing populists demonize either foreigners or a minority population or some external threat, today European democrats are demonizing Haider. Austria hasn't done anything wrong The paradox is that the new Austrian government has not done anything yet. It has not hurt anyone, nor violated any human rights. The stance taken by some other European countries towards foreigners is at least as restrictive as that of Austria. In many places there is a fear that EU expansion will bring with it an influx of people and workers from the East. Is the EU not increasingly becoming a fortress which non-Europeans find it harder and harder to enter? Although there is support in principle for enlargement of the EU, will the practical difficulties and conditions placed on the applicants perhaps be greater than anything so far contemplated in Austria? We have to ask what is the best way to confront the dangers of such populism and the political challenge presented by the Haider phenomenon. Is the political isolation of the Austrian government, of which the Freedom Party is part, really the right reaction? Is it better in such cases to try to prevent such governments being formed at any price? Or is it better to let them go ahead, in the expectation that their populism will lose its charm once it is confronted with reality, and that the populist politicians will become ordinary politicians who have to tackle day-to-day problems? The EU has opted for isolation and the suspension of political bilateral dialogue with the Vienna government, although Austria still participates in EU meetings. With all the accompanying political demonstrations and media attention, the Austrian situation could be an important precedent, a warning for all other similar cases. I believe that the EU's preventive action is important. The question is whether it would have been enough merely to issue a very serious warning, and then take action in specific cases if there were any violations of human rights or any other intolerant acts. Do not re-open post-War treaties Furthermore, one might ask what effect the reaction of the international community will have on Austria's internal politics, and whether it will be positive or negative. Do not the Austrians see this as unjustified meddling in their internal affairs, in the democratic decision they have taken? Another important aspect, which quite wrongly has remained in the background, is the matter of making corrections to the post-war arrangements in Europe. The Austrian coalition is raising the question of the Sudetenland Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia and ethnic Germans evicted from Slovenia, then part of Yugoslavia, after the war. Responsibility for compensating the losses incurred by Austrian citizens through the confiscation of assets on the territory of Yugoslavia was later formally assumed by the Austrian state under the provisions of the Austrian State Treaty. With this treaty Austria was bound to compensate its citizens for damages incurred, instead of paying war reparations to Yugoslavia.Trying to revise these arrangements could jeopardize the basis of the European international system - and yet, that is exactly what the Austrian coalition has been doing. The reopening of post-war issues that had been settled by international treaties has a precedent from the period of the right-wing Italian government of 1994 and 1995. At that time the Italian government demanded that Slovenia return property that had been nationalized after the war, even though the matter had been settled with the Osimo and Rome accords between Italy and Yugoslavia and financial compensation had been paid. The Italians linked the acceptance of the Association Agreement between Slovenia and the EU to the return of this property. That was in effect an attempt to correct the post-war legal arrangements. For two years Italy blocked the signing of the Association Agreement and Slovenia's potential accession to the EU. But the EU did not react to this reopening of post-war historical issues or to the link with EU accession. It was only when a new Italian government, headed by Romano Prodi, came to power that we were able to resolve the issue by means of a compromise involving the gradual opening up of the property market in Slovenia, while Italy lifted its objections to Slovenia joining the EU. The EU did not react to a very clear case of linkage and blackmail. At the time we warned strongly of the danger of allowing such a precedent to be set, that it could spread to other cases (German-Czech, Czech-Austrian or German-Polish relations), and that compensation had been provided by treaties, which had also settled border issues and other vital matters. This is why the reopening of post-war legal arrangements is such a dangerous road to go down and, moreover, conflicts with the very foundations on which the EU is built. Nazism and fascism in World War II caused untold suffering and horror, and maybe the legal arrangements imposed by the victors after the war are not equitable in every little detail. But reopening these questions introduces tension into European relations, opens old wounds, and incites the old emotions to flare once again. When the EU considers the actual policies of the new Austrian government, it would be well advised to give special attention to this issue, and to head off any direct or indirect inclusion of such questions in the enlargement negotiations. If the countries concerned are able to resolve any questions that remain open, then they should do so bilaterally. EU member-states should not attempt to block or slow down the entry of an applicant country, which may then be forced into making unjustified concessions. Genocide is still possible today All this shows that there is a very thin line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in the EU, and that this line is movable. It is quite clear that playing with ideas and emotions that are not so very far from Nazism, fascism or revanchism is unacceptable. This is the most solid point of the European response to Haider. The horrors of World War II must not be repeated at any price. The Yugoslav war provides all the proof we need that today's Europe is not immune to such events. Ethnic cleansing, the slaughter of people from different ethnic backgrounds, genocide - it is all still possible today. The nations of Yugoslavia were not at a level of culture or civilization so very different from that of many other European countries. Policies based on the establishment of either a Greater Serbia or a Greater Germany lead to catastrophe. Politicians who incite such emotions, who seek to repair historical injustices committed against their people, are playing with fire. Sooner or later the flames will take hold. This is why preventive action and reaction make sense, even if they are excessive as in the Austrian case. It is better than not reacting at all. On these issues, Europe and the wider international community must be firm and decisive. A fear of foreigners Another issue is attitudes towards foreigners. Tolerance is one of the fundamental democratic European values. Yet intolerance of foreigners is a common phenomenon in European countries. The EU itself (and some individual countries even more so) is introducing a range of restrictive measures aimed at limiting immigration. Hence the flow of people, and especially workers, between the EU countries and the rest of Europe, including certain EU applicants, is becoming a major problem. Europe is taking preventive measures because of the fear that at some point a spontaneous reaction will occur when a certain threshold of immigration is exceeded. The problem is compounded when politicians stir up emotions and hostile reactions towards immigrants. While most European politicians continue to express their tolerance of foreigners, minorities and different religious groups, a ways must be found of ensuring that practical reactions to the problems of immigration are consistent with these principles. This will be one of the more difficult tasks facing the European Union and Europe as a whole in the future. The issue is intimately linked to the enlargement process. The EU must gradually expand and take in those parts of Europe that have the same goals and values. If part of Europe were to be excluded, and a sharp boundary created between the EU and the rest of Europe, the line between stability and instability would cause new tensions and threats. This is a difficult and very important issue for the future of Europe. The EU has slowed down the enlargement process and tightened the conditions for applicants because it is concerned about its own absorption capacities. But anyone who seeks to develop from this a policy against EU expansion - against foreigners - begins to threaten the very foundations of the European idea. Another issue is that of the transparency and effectiveness of the workings of the democratic structures in the EU countries, and particularly in the EU itself. Anti-bureaucratic populism may be hard to distinguish from normal pressures for greater effectiveness and transparency. It is in the nature of a democracy that the opposition will always look for errors and seek to exert pressure, and it may do so in a way that is populist - it may simplify things and it may be entirely unrealistic. This usually becomes evident once such politicians or parties enter government themselves and are confronted with reality. Here again Europe's politicians and bureaucrats face a difficult task. A constant battle for greater effectiveness and transparency will need to be fought. If not, sooner or later, politicians offering a program directed against the EU, against its alleged alienation of ordinary people, its lack of transparency and its bureaucratic inefficiency, will be victorious in one of the member countries. Haider may no longer be the official leader of the Freedom Party. But he has shown himself capable of exploiting populism, the mistakes of the establishment, and the sluggishness of politics. But his goals are probably not extreme. In a way he has been making them up as he goes along. He has even begun to renounce them, probably partly as a result of the European reaction. Difficult task for Europe He has highlighted a danger, and many Europeans have been shaken by fear. But some good may come of it. Events in Austria, and the reaction to them, have given all European politicians an opportunity to reflect seriously on our values, goals and policies. "

Ale\u0161 Grudnik, Andrej Casar and Matej Velikonja from the Uniformed Police Directorate, Marko Rode from the Service of the Director General of the Police of the General Police Directorate and Bo\u0161tjan Te\u017eak from the Ljubljana Police Directorate will start work in the peace mission on 1 February 2005, replacing Branko Stermecki, Aleksander Majhen, Sa\u0161o Pikon, Zlatko Fi\u0161er and Damjan \u017dgajnar, whose one-year term in the JIPTC finishes on 1 February 2005. Like the instructors so far the new team will participate in the training of Iraqi police officers in the Jordan police centre in Amman.     In the final part of their preparatory training the police officers learnt about the security and political conditions in the region and of specific features of the region. The instructors emphasized how important it is that they exercise extreme caution when living in working in another country. The journalist Valentin Areh talked to them about his practical experience of working in Iraq so that they could picture the concrete situation better.     Honorary Consul General of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Mr. Samir Amarin, presented in detail the country that will be their home for a year     On Wednesday, 12 January 2005, the Honorary Consul General of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Mr. Samir Amarin, attended the training and presented his country to the police officers in a relaxed way; what is the situation in Jordan, its cultural, linguistic, gastronomic and other characteristics. Mr. Amarin was pleased to be able to help; he also promised assistance and support during their stay in Jordan. He pointed out several times that his country is safe, as safety is their biggest capital. \"I am honoured to have been invited and to be able to present my country to you. The police officers who participate in peace missions are ambassadors of humanity in the world and ambassadors of your country. I am pleased that today we clarified some questions and dilemmas you had about safety in Jordan. It is a safe and friendly country and I am glad you are going there. I hope and wish that the cooperation between Slovenia and Jordan will expand in all fields.\"     Chatting with police officers     In Gotenica the police officers also received visits from Mr. Dragutin Mate, the Minister of the Interior, and Dr. Darko An\u017eelj, the Director General of the Police. The Minister said that he was convinced the officers were going to a country that is safe and visitor-friendly. He told the officers he expected them to work well and promised to visit them there this year if his schedule permits. He also said that the Slovenes proved to be honest and fair in all the peace missions we took part in. Slovenian police officers always received the best marks for their professional approach to work. \"I wish and am convinced that it will remain so in the future.\" The Minister thanked Mr. Amarin for taking his time to talk to the officers and help clarify the last dilemmas before their going to Jordan.     The Director General of the Police, Dr. Darko An\u017eelj, wished the officers successful work and said he had no doubt that the Slovenian officers, like their predecessors in international peace missions, will do their job professionally and consolidate the reputation of the Slovenian police in the world.

        "text":" Locking against concurrent editing     If two people try and edit the same wiki page at once some nasty conflicts can occur. Without any kind of warning system one of the editors can save the page, which leaves the other editor with a message warning them about the conflict. An easy way around this is to display warnings for editors that try to start editing wiki pages that are already being edited. i.e. the wiki keeps track of pages being edited.     This can be done in Moin using the editlock system. There are three levels of locking: to warn, to lock and None (turned off).     If you configure Moin to warn, when someone tries to edit a page that is already being edited, they will be presented with a warning message asking them to consider waiting until the current editor has finished.     Moin can also be configured to lock an edited page, only during editing. Here, if some tries to edit a page that is being edited they will receive a message saying that the page is locked and will not be able to edit it until the editor has finished.     A complication of this feature is that an editing session might be started and might not be finished. e.g.:     Someone presses edit and then clicks on a link to exit the page without cancelling.     The browser window is closed without cancelling.     The back button is pressed.     Someone starts editing a page and forgets and leaves it open overnight.     This would result in a page having permanent warnings or being permanently locked. Therefore, both warn and lock have a timeout feature. After a specified number of minutes the feature expires. Note that the timer restarts when you hit preview. If you are actively editing a page and hit preview it is assumed you are still busy and the timer starts again. If you leave the page, or exit it for more time than the timer allows the edit locking runs out and other people are free to edit the page.     Configuration     The edit_locking config variable controls the behaviour of the locking system. This can have the following values:     None, i.e. there is no edit locking. The feature is turned off and nobody is warned or stopped from doing simultaneous edits of a page.     \"warn <timeout>\" tells Moin to warn anyone trying to concurrently editing a page, with a specified timeout, e.g. \"warn 10\" will warn for 10 minutes after an edit is started.     \"lock <timeout>\" tells Moin to lock a page for the specified amount of time after an edit started. e.g. \"lock 5\" locks a page for 5 minutes.     Aborting an edit     For the reasons explained in the timeout description above, you should always use Cancel to cancel an edit if you have enabled edit locking!     Example     Sample interaction of JohnMiller and JaneDoe...     no locking (None)     JohnMiller starts editing a page and JaneDoe thinks she'll edit the same page. She has no idea that someone else is editing the page so they both edit away and hit save. It doesn't matter who started first and did the most editing, whoever hits save changes first will have their changes committed and the unfortunate 2nd editor will have to try and merge their changes in or lose them.     edit warnings (warn)     JohnMiller starts editing a page and JaneDoe thinks she'll edit the same page. When she hits edit she'll see a warning telling her that someone else got there first. If she is polite she'll leave the page, but she can still save before John and he may lose his changes.     edit locking (lock)     JohnMiller starts editing a page and JaneDoe thinks she'll edit the same page. When she hits edit she'll see a warning telling her that someone else got there first and the page is locked. She will have to wait for the page to become available. "

We kindly requested our visitors to follow all guidelines for the prevention of the spread of infections. The two museums will be open until at least 20 June 2021.     You may also order publications by post at the Moderna galerija plus Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova. Please send your request to info@mg-lj.si and specify the publication. You may pay on delivery or on our bank account.     The +MSUM Bookstore is located on the ground floor ot the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova, +MSUM, Maistrova 3.     The +MSUM BOOKSTORE is an alternative to typical museum shops and fits in with the MG+ bookstore and the concept of +MSUM and its evolution as the new museum unit of Moderna galerija in Ljubljana. Besides the MG+MSUM exhibition catalogues and publications from the fields of contemporary art theory and curating, it also offers artists' books, monographs of Slovenian and foreign artists and exhibition catalogues of other Slovenian institutions active in the field of contemporary art.     CONNECTIONS     The ground floor of +MSUM called Connections and designed in cooperation with artist Apolonija \u0160u\u0161ter\u0161i\u010d is intended for interactive linking of the museum with its users, audience as well as different local and international actors. Connections present and visualise the networking of +MSUM with other actors and institutions in the local and international contexts, while the room itself combines the bookstore and the reading room in the 'lawn room' that spreads out to the +MSUM garden and terrace in the summer months.     Connections are further conceived as a place of alternative economy, where a fairer relationship between the institution and the artists' symbolic capital evolves. They are a socialisation area where people meet at seminars, book clubs, convivial evenings and banquets. The room is also open to individual visitors who may read the MG+MSUM publications over tea or coffee.     In the bookstores we have new acquisitions from the Documents of Contemporary Art series, published by MIT Press and the Whitechapel Gallery since 2006. Every book presents a collection of relevant texts and passages, dedicated to specific topics, which present practices or issues, crucial for understanding the contemporary visual culture from various theoretical perspectives.

Implementation of a webshop requires solving bunch of small technical problems. The main goal of this paper is to show what these problems are and how to efficiently solve them. One of them are login via external (3rd- party) provider, which drastically reduces the complexity of user registration and authentication (from the user\u2019s point of view). We have also implement functionalities like discounts, coupons and ability to pay in different currencies. We have taken care of rewriting the URLs, so they look nicer for the end user and webcrawlers (SEO). Payment can also be made with credit cards. We have efficiently dealt with database table with a lot of records (one million) and correctly implement page pagination. A lot of effort was invested into making an administrative side as simple as possible and using AJAX to make the page more interactive. The purpose of this paper is not to show how to implement a webpage from scratch, but to demonstrate the most challenging parts of its implementation. "

        "text":" On the 4th of May 1980, the charismatic leader of SFRY, Josip Broz Tito, died in Ljubljana\u2019s Medical Centre. The event was widely reported on by domestic journalistic mediums, but...     On the 4th of May 1980, the charismatic leader of SFRY, Josip Broz Tito, died in Ljubljana\u2019s Medical Centre. The event was widely reported on by domestic journalistic mediums, but was also adorning covers internationally, from Der Spiegel to New York Times. Among the iconic photographs of Tito which were published alongside the articles, numerous were the work of Joco \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d, a master of photography and, quite coincidentally, Tito\u2019s designated photographer on his visits to Slovenia.     The career path of Joco \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d is just as interesting as the man himself. A former medical student, he began his photojournalistic path at the newspaper Tribuna, and continued at Tovari\u0161 and Delo. He was the first photographer who received the Pre\u0161eren Foundation award in 1977, including for his work as editor of photography at Delo. The same year, he became the first Slovene photographer to win the World Press Photo award for his dramatic sequence of photographs documenting the rescue of a horse on Triglav. His photographs are known to depict people through a profoundly sincere and humanizing lens. His camera was focused equally on gripping documentations of the Iran-Iraq war, the Corsica plane crash, the Slovenian War of Independence, as well as on portraits of the era\u2019s leading politicians. He was assigned the fascinating position of Tito\u2019s official photographer during his time at the daily newspaper Delo in the 1970s. By coincidence, his co-worker fell ill on the day of photographing Tito\u2019s arrival in Predoslje, and \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d\u2019s photographs of the event impressed the editorial office (and Tito) so much, he began taking shots of him everywhere.[1] He followed him all over the world, including on his famous visit to the Great Wall of China, Non-Aligned countries such as Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.[2]     Since the very conception of the medium of photography, leaders of great countries were usually accompanied by numerous photographers. It served the promotion of their governments ever since the 19th century, when queen Victoria issued a photographic album of carte-de-visite portraits which hit record sales in England.[3] Because of its specific nature of depicting \u201cthe objective\u201d, photography was a powerful medium for revealing the \u201ctruth\u201d. The latter was clearly easily manipulated with the right modes of orchestration but was still perceived as the most truthful in the eyes of the public. As was the case for all distinguished leaders of the time, Tito was well aware of photography\u2019s power. These types of images helped establish a cult of personality, which spread quickly amongst the people of Yugoslavia. It had a clear function of promoting ideology through images and gaining support of the people, who were able to identify with numerous representations of Tito \u2013 Tito with pets, children, observing exhibitions, nature, and even while relaxing with a glass of whiskey or a cigar. The series of images showing Tito photographing, however, is much less known.     The fascinating aspect of \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d\u2019s photographs is the fact that he captured moments other photographers haven\u2019t noticed, or perhaps haven\u2019t considered important. He never made official, rigid images of politicians, but preferred to present them as he did ordinary people, for example in his moving series of the impoverished people of Kozjansko. Thus, a number of photographs depicting Tito in unconventional scenarios was created. Among them, a series of presidential portraits focused on his relationship with the camera. Tito loved to take photos, which is visible for example in the photograph from Dra\u017ego\u0161e, where he is handing one of his polaroids to General Vidovi\u010d on the spot. In an interview, \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d told the newspaper Delo that Tito once commented on his camera, saying he owned a better one. He replied that this may be true, but he was a better photographer. A delicate statement was thankfully met with laughter from Tito\u2019s wife Jovanka.[4]     Beside its advertising function, Tito was also aware of photography\u2019s artistic potential. Republic exhibitions of photography were frequent and important events, which by themselves spoke volumes of the president\u2019s love of photography. Now for the first time, he is presented as a photographer himself. These photographs were not part of a narrative of propaganda, but instead show Yugoslavia\u2019s president engaged in a perhaps slightly unusual hobby. As Bogdan Poga\u010dnik wrote about \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d\u2019s photographs: ''Even though the collection shows \u2013 whether Tito is by himself or in the company of others \u2013 only one person, this presentation is never imbued with regime ideology or stylistically pathetic, but always gentle and democratic, simple and straightforward''.[5] In certain photographs, it seems as if \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d is photographing Tito and vice versa, while both are exuding joy behind the camera \u2013 one with a smile and camera in hand as subject of the image, the other as its passionate documentarist. Through the double lens of photographer and his subject, Joco \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d\u2019s photographs remind us of a fascinating man, an intriguing time in history and a universal love of photography.

        "text":" Navigacija_level2     I\u0161\u010di     Povezave     IRWIN: LIKE TO LIKE     19.10.2006     Mala galerija - Moderna galerija, Ljubljana (Slovenska cesta 35)     19 October - 12 November 2006     You are kindly invited to attend the opening of the exhibition on Thursday, 19 October, at 8 p.m. at the Mala galerija, preceded by a press conference on the occasion of the publication of the IRWIN RETROPRINCIP book at 7 p.m.     The group Irwin was established in 1983; in 1984 it was one of the founding members of Neue Slowenische Kunst. Irwin members: Du\u0161an Mandi (Ljubljana, 1954), Miran Mohar (Novo mesto, 1958), Andrej Savski (Ljubljana, 1961), Roman Uranjek (Trbovlje, 1961), Borut Vogelnik (Kranj, 1959).     Irwin is one of the preeminent artists' groups not only in Slovenia, but also in the world. It has been exhibiting since 1983 (the first two solo shows were staged in Disko FV and at the Kapelica gallery, both in Ljubljana). To date, the group has exhibited at virtually all important exhibition venues worldwide; this year in Stuttgart (Stuttgart Kunstverein: On Difference), Vienna (Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig: Works from the Collection of Erste Bank), Malm\u00f6 (Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art: Normalization), Riga, Tehran, Saint Petersburg, Heidelberg, New York (Museum of Modern Art: Eye on Europe: Prints, Books and Multiples 1960 to Now), Sarajevo, Dubrovnik, Istanbul, and in Slovenia at the Gallery Gregor Podnar (Venture II in Like to Like) and the Moderna galerija (Interrupted Histories and Arteast Collection 2000+23).     Irwin has also edited two significant publications: East Art Map (New Moment Magazine, Ljubljana 2002) and East Art Map, Contemporary Art in Eastern Europe (Afterall, London 2006). These \"maps of the art of the East\" are the fruits of the labor of numerous artists - in addition to Irwin - from twenty countries, who participated in selecting the most momentous and pivotal events, works, and ideas that had crucially influenced the development and understanding of art in the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe.     Irwin's project called Like to Like (2003 - 2004) consists of six large-scale color photographs presenting actions and projects in landscape. For anyone familiar with Slovene art after 1945, the images are easily recognizable as projects of the group OHO (originally carried out between 1968 and 1970).     However, Irwin appropriated the OHO projects not by using the original photographs, but by re-staging the original actions. This difference is strikingly accentuated by the use of the spectacular possibilities of contemporary photography.     We should of course connect this project to the most fundamental principles of Irwin's work. The group has described their basic working method (besides the principle of collective work) as the Retro-Principle. An essential aspect of this principle is their programmatic eclecticism. What they depict and combine in their works are other images and symbols.     Irwin, therefore, did an interesting shift. They repeated the projects, but the composition of the images remains clearly based on (although not identical with) the OHO documentary photographs. With the decision to re-stage the actions, Irwin actually went back to the original logic of the OHO group. They did not use \"external\" imagery from the documentary photographs, but the original OHO concepts that can be (as we said) materially executed and repeated anywhere and anytime. On the other hand, Irwin's works of art are not actions as such, but the photographs (made by a professional photographer Toma Gregori ). What they present, therefore, are not just OHO actions, but OHO as a phenomenon that already belongs to the history of art and culture.     (Excerpted from the text by Igor Zabel in the catalogue, 2004.) "

        "text":" Wind Profiles and Mesoscale Data Assimilation     Ljubljana, 19-20 September 2016     About fifty years ago the first sensitivity experiments on the importance of various observations for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) showed that \u201cNot all data are equal in their information-yielding capacity. Some are more equal than others. This tells us that if there is a choice as to what can be measured, then one variable may be preferable over another.\u201d (Smagorinsky, 1969). Wind information, the \u201cmore equal\u201d one, remains the main missing component of the global observing system. Observations of the vertical wind profiles by the ESA ADM-Aeolus mission have been demonstrated to have the potential of providing a significant improvement in NWP, primarily in the tropics where the lack of wind information is most critical for the global NWP. The same dynamical and data issues that apply to the tropics are shared by mesoscale NWP models.     The workshop aims to discuss some open issues in mesoscale data assimilation for NWP. In particular, the workshop is an opportunity to present latest advances and discuss new ideas related to the following topics:     Application of ADM-Aeolus winds in mesoscale models     Wind observations and balanced initial conditions on mesoscale     Gravity waves versus imbalance in data assimilation     Presentations on the operational applications and research related to the assimilation of wind observations and the balance issues in mesoscale data assimilation are welcome.     Movie: Simulated 12-hour track of the ESA ADM-Aeolus satellite with every second location of the expected horizontal line-of-sight wind profiles.

        "text":" The acronym DESSA stands for \"Delovna skupnost samostojnih arhitektov\", which is the Slovene term for The Association of Freelance Architects. This organization provided both a business framework and a physical space for the activities of freelance architects who work in various design fields, ranging from urban planning, architecture, interior and graphic design to theatre set design.     In 1982, 36 architects founded DESSA with the primary purpose of helping private architects work in a socialist society. Yet DESSA, as a non-profit organization, has another principle objective -- elevating general societal awareness of the cultural value of architecture. It is, therefore, also concerned with publishing and organizing exhibitions, lectures and excursions. The gallery and office of DESSA, located on Zidovska steza 4 in Ljubljana's city centre, opened on 17 Aprile 1989. Boris Podrecca, an internationally recognized architect, currently working in Vienna, donated his design services for the gallery complex.     In 1991 DESSA founded Arh\u00e9, a design firm that helped members produce and sell architectural designs. In 1996 with 74 founding members, DESSA restructured itself and registered as a non-profit cultural foundation. Thus Arh\u00e9 had acquired the commerce and financial responsibilities of DESSA, which therefore allowed DESSA to concentrate its energies on culture activities pertinent to the field of architecture. Arh\u00e9 was closed down in 2012. Today, gallery program depends on donations of Ministry of Culture and eventual sponsors.

From a business point of view, artists must legally and formally document their creative activity, thus a number of administrative procedures need to be carried out, followed by various accounting commitments. Which is why it is extremely important for creators to acquire this knowledge as soon as possible.     The basics of the law dealing with economic status, various legal forms, and administrative commitments will be addressed at the workshop within the project Educational Workshops: Strengthening the Cultural and Creative Sector, which Asocijacija is co-producing with the Centre for Creativity at the Museum for Architecture and Design. Accounting for creatives will be led by tax consultant Urh Vele.     The basics of accounting and taxes for the self-employed will be clearly presented at the workshop. The characteristics of various forms of status (s.p., d.o.o., institute, association), types of taxes (direct, indirect), methods of taxation on income from work (standard costs, actual income \/ expenses), etc. will be presented. We will also focus on completing the annual tax return, which must be submitted to the tax administration by the end of March by all those who are already active.     The workshop will be conducted through the online platform Zoom. Participants must register for the workshop in advance no later than March 20, 2021.     To do this, send an e-mail to marusa.golob@asociacija.si, in which you clearly indicate which workshop you are applying for. Applicants will receive access to the online workshop by e-mail.     The program is part of the project Educational Workshops: Strengthening the Cultural and Creative Sector, which the Association carries out in co-production with the Centre for Creativity at the Museum for Architecture and Design. The Centre for Creativity platform is co-financed by the European Union from the Fund for European Regional Development and the Republic of Slovenia. "

Our primary mission is to provide comprehensive psychosocial assistance and support to the victims of sexual violence and to stand by their side in the path of recovery. The association was founded in 1994 under the name Association Against Sexual Abuse. After 25 years of existence we adopted the name Reclaim the Power Association to fully express our commitment to the contemporary social work theory and practice.     Our work is based on the recognition of the dynamics of sexual violence and thus appropriate professional action:     Sexual violence is a form of violence, namely abuse of power, position, influence and knowledge over another person.     The perpetrator holds full responsibility for sexual violence!     Sexual violence is one of the worst possible crimes committed against another human being, as it affects the intimacy of a person and can lead to sexual traumatization, thus significantly affecting the quality of life of the victim.     Each victim responds differently to sexual violence and carries different psychological, social and biological consequences.     Victims of sexual violence need a supportive environment, one that accepts their expressions, provides support and a sense of security, as well as gives assistance in accordance with expressed needs.     We provide help and support for minors and adults who:     have experienced sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence,     have experienced sexual violence by a partner, relative, acquaintance, associate or other person,     want to protect a child, adolescent or adult person from sexual abuse,     counselling work with adolescents,     In addition to individual and group forms of assistance and support, our work is also focused on counselling and support for professionals and institutions who may face cases of sexual violence and abuse in their working environment. We also provide training on sexual abuse for all professional profiles.     CONTACT     You are politely invited to make any inquiry about our organization and work. We are available every weekday between 8 am and 4 pm or write us a message and we will respond to you as soon as possible. "

Startup companies generally do not possess the systems and knowledge to manage the entire development process within regulatory frameworks. Typical time-to-market for a medical device is 3 to 5 years, while it can be even longer for bio innovations or new drugs.     The webinar was organised by EIT Health (LUI) and HealthDay.si and featured:     Mateja Urlep, author of the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Innovations in the Slovenian Health System (book in the making), and president of the Think Tank DIH.HealthDay.si     Igor Rogelj and Diego Casadei of ArrowFast, Cosylab's new special unit to help innovators in the field of medical devices, also a new partner of HealthDay.si     representatives of Slovenian health insurance companies on the new reality of digital healthcare (not recorded)     She is the \u201cmother of biosimilar drugs\u201d - a key role in designing specific EMA and FDA regulations and introducing these drugs into clinical practice in the EU and the US as a global manager in Sandoz.

When a group of us listened together this flaw was frequently interpreted as an over driven microphone or over saturated tape. Whatever verbal term used to describe this error, it became an accepted part of that recording. Cleaning with best methods and great attention to adjustments did not always resolve the problem and this continued with multiple tonearms and cartridges, in some cases for many years.     That changed once the Kuzma 4 Point 14\" was set up to perfection, at which point these problems were rendered less obvious and in some cases were resolved completely.     The best way I can describe this, I am now getting greater dynamic range with peaks that are not only louder but I'm also hearing an improvement in resolution within that dynamic. This higher peak sound pressure level replaces a previously compressed, clipped or distorted portion of that recording. This improvement is unique, something I've never encountered to this extent with any other tonearm. It sometimes requires long term listening to notice because it's either very slight or we've become accustomed to it and have no expectation it can be improved.     \"The Kuzma arm gets out of the way so well it makes good cartridges sound better, and really good cartridges sound fantastic!\"     in zaklju\u010dkom:     \"Highly recommended, and a new reference point irrespective of cost-this might just be the best arm you can buy today.\" \" Zelo priporo\u010dljivo in nova referenca za ro\u010dice, ne glede na ceno in mogo\u010de celo najbolj\u0161a ro\u010dica, ki jo lahko danes sploh kupite.\"     V reviji v blogu TAS pi\u0161e J.

        "text":" Abstract     The basic idea is simple: graffiter paints with a specially modified can, which when pressed on the cap does not leave color traces, but emits infrared light. The computer application draws the appropriate graffiti on the canvas, which is positioned in front of the graffiter. Infrared camera provides detection of the light source for the application, which then correctly determines the color, size and density (the graffiter regulates these parameters through the speed buttons, which are located on the can) and in the end of this process, the current drawing track is projected on the canvas. The most important algorithms used in the implementation of the software solution are: an algorithm for locating the brightest area, the algorithm for the implementation of the drops and the algorithm for interpolation. Important component of simulation is also a Bluetooth connection to the Arduino BT platform, which is connected to three potentiometers. These are used by graffiter to manipulate painting parameters. The results of extensive tests have shown that the prototype has potential and that the final simulation perfectly follows the basic idea. The problem occurs only in the lack of quality of the equipment (infrared camera, computer power) for full implementation.

Instalacija temelji na prepletanju skupnih izvorov znanosti, duhovnosti in filozofije; vsebuje glasbo, pretvorjeno iz podatkov o vetru. Z upo\u0161tevanjem glasbene terapije imajo frekvence pozitiven u\u010dinek, s pomo\u010djo meditativne dihalne tehnike pa lahko \u010dlovek z dihanjem izbolj\u0161a svoje psihofizi\u010dno stanje.

Tu prihaja svetovna ljubezen do nas, ki digitalno spreminja prostor v sobi. Ko izdihnemo, napolnimo svet s svojo ljubeznijo. Ljubi ta svet in ljubil te bo. Ob\u010duti vibracije zvoka planeta, postani eno s svetom in naravo, raztopi se v dihu vetra \u2026     \/\/ Breath of the Wind is an audio meditative installation based on the Bora wind, music, meditation techniques such as breathing.     Sharing common roots in science, spirituality and philosophy, the installation contains music converted from wind data. With the help of music therapy, frequencies have a positive effect, and through a meditative breathing technique, a person will breathe, improving their condition.     The Bora wind enters from the real geographic space while inhaling, filling the inner geography of a person, changing it, purifying the lungs and filling it with the melody of air and nature. This is where the world\u2019s love for us comes in, digitally modifying the space inside the room. As we exhale, we fill the world with our love. Love this world and it will love you in turn. Feeling the vibrations of the sound of the planet, become one with the world and nature, dissolve in the breath of the wind \u2026     OhMyGods je simulator za zmenke v nastajanju. V igri lahko na zmenek povabi\u0161 enega od \u0161tevilnih bogov iz razli\u010dnih mitologij, s ciljem, da jih prepri\u010da\u0161, da te naredijo nesmrtnega. Na semestrski razstavi (februarja 2021) je bila predstavljena osnovna ideja, nato pa se je ekipa lotila resnej\u0161ega razvoja igre. Posvetili smo se dvema zgodbama karakterjev iz prej\u0161nje razli\u010dice, ve\u010dji poudarek pa smo dali psiholo\u0161kim aspektom razmerij. Ekipa namerava igro \u0161e naprej razvijati v tej smeri, prav tako \u017eelimo postopno dodati ve\u010d funkcij in novih bogov za zmenke. \/\/ OhMyGods is a dating simulator in progress. In the game, you can court a variety of deities from different mythologies, and your goal is to convince them to make you immortal. Since the last semestre show (in February 2021), where the initial demo was presented, more serious development of the game had started. The storylines for two of the deities featured in the last version were rewritten in more detail, with attention given to psychology of relationships. The team aims to continue developing the game in this direction, and eventually adding more features, as well as more deities to go on dates with.     ODMEV \u2013 zvo\u010dna instalacija \/\/ ECHO \u2013 sound installation Avtor \/\/ Author: Vasily Kuzmich, 3. letnik \/\/ Year 3     Echo je bila odvzeta sposobnost obi\u010dajnega govora. Ko je vrhovna boginja Hera posku\u0161ala ujeti svojega soproga Zevsa pri varanju, je Echo s svojim govorom odvrnila Hero in s tem pomagala nimfam, da bi se izognile kazni. V enem trenutku se je Hera tega naveli\u010dala in je odvzela Echo mo\u017enost pogovarjanja z drugimi, tako da ji je pustila le mo\u017enost ponavljanja besed drugih ljudi.     Odmev \u2013 reflektiran zvok. Odmeve opazimo, \u010de iz vira zasli\u0161imo tudi neposreden zvok, ko na enem mestu v prostoru ve\u010dkrat sli\u0161imo zvok iz enega vira, ki prihaja po neposredni poti in se odbije (morda ve\u010dkrat) od okoli\u0161kih predmetov. Ker zvo\u010dni val med odbojem izgubi energijo, se lahko zvok iz mo\u010dnej\u0161ega vira zvoka ve\u010dkrat odbije od povr\u0161in (na primer hi\u0161 ali zidov, ki so obrnjeni drug proti drugemu) in prehaja skozi eno to\u010dko, kar bo povzro\u010dilo ve\u010d odmevov (tak odmev opazimo pri grmenju). Kot v starodavnih mitih, v slovenskih jamah in predorih Nove Gorice, se odmevanje sli\u0161i povsod. Je sestavni del narave, ki govori o kraju in njegovem vzdu\u0161ju, prostoru in tudi ti\u0161ini. Odmev izni\u010di posamezne zvoke, kar pripomore k novi opredelitvi in \u200b\u200bjasnosti tega zvoka. S pomo\u010djo 8-kanalnega zvo\u010dnega sistema bo mogo\u010de odmev poustvariti in ljudem pomagati, da se v urbanem okolju potopijo v naravo.     \/\/ Echo was deprived of the ability to speak normally. When the supreme goddess Hera tried to catch her consort, Zeus, during treason, Echo intervened. With her speech, she distracted Hera, thereby helping the nymphs\u2019 friends to avoid punishment. At some point, Hera got tired of this and she deprived Echo of theopportunity to conduct a conversation, leaving only the ability to repeat other people\u2019s words.     Echo \u2013 reflectedsound. Echoes are noticed if also a direct sound is heard from a source when at one point in space one can hear a sound from one source several times, coming along a direct path and reflected (possibly several times) from surrounding objects. Since a sound wave loses energy during reflection, a sound wave from a stronger sound source can be reflected from surfaces (for example, houses or walls facing each other) many times, passing through one point, which will cause multiple echoes (such an echo can be observed from thunder).     As in ancient myths, the caves of Slovenia, and the tunnels of Nova Gori\u0441a, Echo is heard everywhere. It is an integral part of nature, speaking of a place and its atmosphere, volume, and also silence. Echo cancels out individual sounds, which helps to redefine that sound and make it clear. With the help of an 8-channel audio system, it will be possible to recreate this echo and help people immerse themselves in nature in an urban environment.

        "text":" Flying across the Namib Desert in a hot air balloon     Five years ago, when my wife and I were first wandering across Namibia or, more precisely, the Sossusvlei pan, its greatest landmark, two hot air balloons appeared in the morning sky. We said to ourselves that it would be cool to try, but we had no time for a balloon adventure back then. Well, this year we finally made our wish come true: flying over the Namib Desert is an unforgettable experience, which makes you see the desert in a completely different light. Amongst the dunes of the wide Sossusvlei Valley hide long-forgotten dried-up lakes, such as Hidden Vlei and Dead Vlei, created a long time ago by the Tschaub River travelling towards the Atlantic Ocean it would never reach. In and of itself, these places are incredibly picturesque: however, seeing them from a hot air balloon calmly gliding by gives them another dimension. Red sand lying over white and brown sand dunes is brought along by air streams and is deposited on dunes that surround these lost valleys. Some trees, with roots reaching up to 50 m in depth, are still able to reach the groundwater and can therefore survive for now; most of the trees in this dry, hot desert climate, however, have long since died, leaving their carbonised branches and tree trunks to decorate the lost world of this part of the Namib Desert. The aerial view reveals so much more than one can see while standing on the sand crunching under your feet.     Our flight took place in the early morning, a little while before sunrise: that\u2019s the only time a calm atmosphere and favourable winds allow hot air balloons to fly. Due to pronounced thermals and strong winds, flying later would be too dangerous. It could happen that a hot air balloon finds itself having to land amongst the dunes: once there, it would be impossible for the passengers to return, at least through the usual means of transport. We were flying in one large and one small balloon: the small one was reserved for two newly married couples, while the large one accepted a crowd of around fifteen individuals who have been enduring the \u201cpunishment\u201d of marriage for a while longer, accompanied by our South African pilot. As we rose to a height of about 1800 m, the smaller balloon, which flew slightly below us, provided a beautiful addition to the backdrop of the desert emerging on the horizon and uncovering itself below us. The dry beds of the rivers Aub (in the south) and Tschaub (in the north) meander through the Sossusvlei towards the west: as they seep into the sand, they never reach the Atlantic Ocean, even when the riverbeds are filled with water. For the Tschaub River, this last occurred for about two weeks in 2011; as far as the Aub River is concerned, nobody can remember the time when water was last flowing through its riverbed. Despite this, both riverbeds are surrounded by a surprisingly large number of living trees, mainly thorn acacias which have extremely deep roots and can also survive in an environment where it practically never rains. All water that sometimes reaches this remote corner of the world comes from a highland in Central Namibia during the rainy seasons. The other water source, which is probably even more important, is the fog, descending for a couple of hours every morning on the coastline and reaching up to 30 km towards the interior of the desert. This fog is a consequence of an extremely cold Benguela ocean current flowing from the south towards the north next to the Namibian coast. When it encounters warmer land air masses, a cloud of fog covers the desert. Numerous plants and animals populating the desert have adapted themselves to the water produced by this fog: without it, there would be no life in the Namib Desert. Our hot air balloon flight also uncovered some of the inhabitants of the desert: an oryx and its shadow, treading along a well-worn path, a water source with little paths leading towards the watering hole like sun beams, and a hole created by a bushpig, an unusual nocturnal animal which is practically impossible to be seen. We also saw numerous roads and cart tracks, a clear sign that this seemingly impassable desert is crisscrossed with many paths used by people and various means of transport. After about an hour, we were back on solid ground: our pilot landed exactly on the intended spot, nearly crushing the truck that later drove away with the basket and the balloon.     After landing, a glass of champagne and breakfast under one of the red dunes were awaiting us. This was a little too posh and unnecessary for my liking, but it came with the package. The hot air balloon flight, however expensive, was worth the money. It\u2019s something you can afford \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d, but I\u2019d be immediately ready to do it again. Well, maybe some other time, and at another location, even though I\u2019m afraid there aren't many locations as picturesque as this one \u2026     Dr. Tom Turk     Dr. Tom Turk is a professor of biochemistry at the Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana. He is a biologist and an author of books about life in the Adriatic Sea and Mediterranean Sea, traveller and nature photographer who, every now and then, still dives below the sea surface and takes an underwater photograph or two.

Such a typologisation requires a focus on changes in political paradigms relating to changing forms of societies, and on particular reactions to processes of globalisation. It is argued that adopting this approach can make research more precise both in studying a single country and for comparative cross-country research. In this article we report on development and testing of conceptualisations of pre-modern, modern national, authoritarian national and post-modern populism with reference to the case of Slovenia, a society which has recently undergone dynamic change.

Na ta na\u010din je bila jasno poudarjena dinamika krepitve parlamentarne dimenzije v Evropski uniji (EU), ki se posledi\u010dno dotika tudi polja slovenskega predsedovanja Svetu EU, saj je ravno ratifikacija omenjene pogodbe ena izmed poglavitnih prioritet. Lizbonska pogodba, skupaj z aneksiranim Protokolom o vlogi nacionalnih parlamentov v Evropski uniji, prispeva k novi kakovosti vpetosti nacionalnih parlamentov v proces oblikovanja politik na evropski ravni (COSAC, 2008: 7) in pomeni nov elan za re\u0161evanje vpra\u0161anj parlamentarizacije Unije ter spopadanja s problemi demokrati\u010dne legitimnosti Skupnosti. Rezultati kohezivnosti glasovanja poslancev Dr\u017eavnega zbora v obdobju od leta 1994 do leta 2008 ne obetajo izpolnitve izpostavljenih upov, saj so slednji delovali zelo strate\u0161ko in v skladu s strukturno mo\u010djo politi\u010dnih strank. Posledi\u010dno je percepcija vpliva Evrope na vzorce poslanskega delovanja le rezultat konsenza politi\u010dnih elit glede strate\u0161kih ciljev, saj se po zaklju\u010dku procesov vklju\u010devanja vzorci glasovalne kohezivnosti vrnejo na raven iz za\u010detka devetdesetih. Na tej stopnji ostanejo tudi v obdobju predsedovanja, kar ka\u017ee na odsotnost vsesplo\u0161nega konsenza s preloma tiso\u010dletja ter dojemanje predsedovanja kot strankarskega projekta. Rezultati se tako ka\u017eejo predvsem kot opomin procesu (nacionalne) parlamentarizacije Skupnosti ter posledi\u010dnega zmanj\u0161evanja problemov demokrati\u010dne legitimnosti.

Capacity of local development planning in Slovenia : stre     Toma\u017e De\u017eelan     article in scientific publication     13.12.2014 21:35     Toma\u017e De\u017eelan, Alem Maksuti, Matja\u017e Ur\u0161i\u010d Capacity of local development planning in Slovenia : strengths and weaknesses of local sustainable development strategies.     Despite being coined by international forums and promoted chiefly by international\/supranational organisations and clubs, sustainable development is a concept that in essence rests on and is largely determined by the local level. The local level\u2019s primacy in terms of introducing the principles of sustainability is openly stipulated by Agenda 21, thus providing the impetus for local sustainable development strategies \u2013 Local Agenda 21. These community-specific, long-term visions of sustainable co-existence serve as an important strategic tool for overcoming challenges communities may face while maintaining the general idea of the future. As prime standardised artifacts, local sustainable development strategies represent an excellent insight into the capacity of an individual community to achieve a sustainable future and deal with potential challenges. In this paper, we analysed four such visions of a sustainable future for two city and two minor Slovenian municipalities in order to examine their capacity to develop into sustainable communities. By employing George and Kirkpatrick\u2019s (2006) framework for assessing sustainable development strategies, we identified useful and problematic aspects of the documents prepared by the city and town municipalities. The analysis showed that the transition period in Slovenia has left a significant impact on development planning and its consequences have yet to be fully resolved.     Change in the Party System from Liberal to Ethnic-based P     Elena Nacevska     article in scientific publication     14.04.2019 19:51     Elena Nacevska, Danica Fink Hafner Change in the Party System from Liberal to Ethnic-based Polarisation - The Case of Macedonia     Although party systems (PSs) have been studied a lot, there is still insufficient research into the transition from a PS characterised by the predominance of liberal-based political parties into a PS in which ethnicor religious-based parties dominate. The article helps rectify this deficiency by combining a quantitative approach using numerical measurements of PSs and a qualitative approach for determining the characteristics of PSs and how they change. This combination of approaches in the empirical study of the PS and the way it developed in Macedonia between 1990 and 2018 proved crucial for revealing the growing polarisation within the PS based on the stronger ethnic polarisation,an aspect uncapturable by the usual quantitative measurement of PS change.

Based on an overview of the characteristics and uses of the Delphi method, a special Delphi design for searching for minimal common definitions of globalisation, Europeanisation and internationalisation in higher education and their mutual relationships is presented in detail. While the method proved valuable, its strengths and weaknesses are also discussed. Finally, ideas for adjusting the Delphi method are proposed.

More precisely, from a comparative perspective, the authors analyse empirical modes as they have been evolving in Slovenia since the country's transition to a democracy (1990-2017). The articles present theoretical sub-framing relevant to specific aspects of governance; they analyse the empirical dynamics of each particular type of governance studied and evaluate them. Two democratic values are used as the main assessment criteria: representation and accountability. An analysis of empirical governance takes into account the dynamics of each of the particular mode of governance and identifies the trends in their empirical functioning in Slovenia since its transition to a democratic political system.

Ob tem je posebna pozornost namenjena liberalni, dr\u017eavljansko-republikanski in kozmopolitski tradiciji. Hkrati se delo spopada tudi s preseganjem tradicionalnega razumevanja dr\u017eavljanstva, predvsem v primeru dr\u017eavljanstva Evropske unije, ki vse bolj determinira do\u017eivljanje politi\u010dne skupnosti Evropejcev.

However, being present at both levels is not necessarily the dominant strategy such groups follow. Relying on a survey of 97 Slovenian interest groups active in 11 different policy fields, this article analyses: (1) which factors determine use of a dual strategy; and (2) which groups have an advantage in representing their interests. Several factors in particular contribute to the pursuit of a dual strategy: (a) the interest group is economically-focussed; (b) it has a higher number of employees and (c) a higher level of activity; (d) the interest group is active in a policy sector falling within the EU\u2019s competency and (e) is young.     EU public policies seen from a national perspective: Slov     Damjan Lajh     scientific monograph     06.01.2016 21:14     Damjan Lajh, Zdravko Petak EU public policies seen from a national perspective: Slovenia and Croatia in the European Union     This book concerns the characteristics, problems and prospects of EU public policies from the perspective of two countries \u2013 Slovenia and Croatia, which shared the common historical experience of the socialist system of former Yugoslavia; after independence, they both started seeking membership in the European integration. Over the last 25 years they have both experienced deep political, social and economic changes, while the European Union has played quite a significant role in these transformation processes \u2013 it has intervened in the operation of both countries\u2019 political systems and the regulation of individual policy domains. The book is divided into two parts. The first deals with actors and processes, while the second focuses on an analysis of various policy sectors. The first set of policy sectors covers regulatory, distributive and redistributive policies (the economy, agriculture, cohesion, transport and the environment) regarding which a great proportion of sovereignty has been transferred to the EU level. The second set of policy sectors covers policies that are mostly \u2018only\u2019 coordinated at the EU level, while an important proportion of sovereignty has remained at the level of member states (employment and education). In this way, individual chapters analyse policy sectors in the respective country in three steps: main characteristics before accession to the EU (to identify any \u2018mismatch\u2019 between national and EU levels, whether the sector was non\/problematic from the viewpoint of accession); the Europeanisation process (the EU\u2019s role in reform processes); and the biggest problems and prospects in the period of full membership.     Europeanisation as a Factor of National Interest Group Po     Danica Fink-Hafner     article in scientific publication     05.06.2014 14:04     Danica Fink-Hafner, Mitja Hafner-Fink, Meta Novak Europeanisation as a Factor of National Interest Group Political-Cultural Change The Case of Interest Groups in Slovenia     Based on a social constructivist framing, this article seeks to address the gap in the literature on the impact of Europeanisation on the national interest group political culture in general and in the post-communist context in particular. The impacts of Europeanisation on interest group domestic policy behaviour, in terms of national interest groups networking with their European counterparts, their contacts with EU-level decision makers, and their access to EU funds, are tested based on the panel surveys that were conducted in 1996 and 2012 of the most influential interest groups in eleven policy fields in Slovenia. Our key findings are that Europeanisation does support changes in the national interest group political culture in the direction of a more pro-active approach in influencing national policy processes. However, Europeanisation explains only a small portion of the variability among the domestic policy behaviour of interest groups.     \/East European politics and societies, ISSN 0888-3254, 2014.

In the frame of contested theoretical approaches, the implications of matching the knowledge that is acquired during education to the skills that are needed on the job are also examined. Design\/methodology\/approach: Using the REFlex HEGESCO database, as well as other secondary data, the wider disciplinary and contextual environments are presented. Disciplinary and contextual mapping is followed by binary logistic regression of primary data collected from Slovene political science graduates. Based on the results, the authors determined the validity of certain theoretical premises of human capital, credentialist, and assignment approaches, specifically regarding education-job matching. Findings: In terms of graduate education-job match, the results indicate that the relevance of the sector of employment relates to educational as well as skill match. The results also indicate that matched candidates utilize the skills acquired during the education process to a greater degree, which adds weight to the assignment theory's presumption. The effect of formal credentials is relevant, because graduates with Bologna degrees, despite having attended programs with virtually identical curricula at the same institution, are significantly less matched when compared to non-Bologna graduates. Accordingly, the effect of the change to the structure of the system of higher education (HE), which is amplified by the period effect of the economic crisis, implies a serious change to graduates\u2019 opportunity structure. Practical implications: The study should motivate a re-examination of the teleological purpose of the study by professional associations in the state. It should also motivate the adjustment of the study programs to the new conditions graduates face and strengthen the educator-employer relationship to make the latter cognizant about the study programs and the skills of graduates. In addition, the study should provide grounds for a critical discussion about the implications of governmental austerity measures on the public sector. Originality\/value: The paper provides new insights into the early careers of political scientists and social scientists at large. It also offers early evidence on the effect of the Bologna's HE reform and indications about the early career achievements in a crisis-struck post-communist country.

Methods: Hospital records pertaining to elective caesarean section after 37 weeks gestation from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2016 were analyzed. Two subgroups were established (\u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d). The rate of elective caesarean section before 39 weeks gestation, the rate of neonatal respiratory disorders, and admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit were compared between the subgroups.     Results: A total of 1881 elective caesarean sections were performed from 37 weeks gestation (1.083 [57.6%] in the before sub\u2013group and 798 [42.4%] in the after sub\u2013 group). In the after sub\u2013group there was a 9.8% reduction of procedures performed before 39 weeks gestation. Of the newborns, 1.59% had various respiratory problems (2.3% and 1.00% in the before and after sub\u2013groups, respectively; p = 0.08). Six of 30 (20.0%) newborns were transferred to the neonatal intensive unit (4\/22 [18.2%] and 2\/8 [25.0%] in the before and after sub\u2013groups, respectively).     Conclusion: The policy reduced the rate of elective caesarean sections before 39 weeks gestation and the rate of neonatal respiratory disorders, even though the incidence of these disorders was rather low, even before the new policy.

The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.

        "text":" Qualitative trust management methods     Abstract     In performing various tasks we often rely on others. While driving, we trust the manufacturer to produce a working car, civil engineers to build safe roads, and fellow drivers to comply to driving rules; if we did not, we would not be driving. Trust thus allows us to function in an unpredictable environment. For similar reasons, it is also becoming prevalent in computing, particularly in distributed systems, in which different users fulfill their goals by interacting with and thus relying on each other. Trust management systems are computer programs that advise users about trustworthiness of other entities in the system. This dissertation tackles two problems. First, we deal with trust models\u2014mathematical procedures that compute trust\u2014that use data presented with linguistic labels, which we term qualitative values. The model uses qualitative data to express assessments in past interactions, judgments in received opinions, and degrees of trust in trust estimations. We manipulate qualitative values appropriately by devising a method for estimating the most representative qualitative value in a collection of such values. We experimentally evaluate the model and compare it against the most influential works in the literature. In the second part, we deal with the evaluation of trust models. We propose a method that can directly evaluate and compare the performances of trust models regardless of their type: be it qualitative or quantitative. We implement the method and devise an experiment, which shows that the assumption underlying most of existing approaches, does not always hold. This shows that our approach, free of this assumption, is more general. "

        "text":" Chemistry     Chemistry was one of the foundation disciplines in an Institute devoted initially to research in nuclear energy. Laboratories for analytical chemistry and for fluorination and preparation of uranium hexafluoride were established, and these two general areas are still actively pursued today. In the fifties the first flame atomic spectrometer and the first mass spectrometer in Yugoslavia were built on site, and the use of atomic absorption and emission spectroscopy for determining metals was introduced. Work in the fluorination laboratory concentrated first on the production of elemental fluorine and on management of the demanding experimental techniques for work with this aggressive element. Investigations connected with ceramic nuclear fuel based on uranium dioxide followed soon after. From the beginning, much of the Institute's chemical research has had direct applications in view, and this is reflected in the number of contracts with Slovenian industry. It has resulted in the development of technologically demanding products such as varistors, microwave resonators, capacitors, PTC resistors, sensors, ferrites, rare earth permanent magnets, hybrid circuits, and mechanically resistant ceramics. Co-operation with industrial partners in Slovenia includes the production of mineral fibres for thermal isolation, and the manufacture of glass. Among other European industrial partners there is a cooperation with the MAN Roland Druckmaschinen company on the development of ferroelectric cylinders for a new form of printing.     Today chemistry based research in the Institute follows four main directions. In the field of synthetic chemistry of inorganic fluorine compounds, synthesis of the then unknown xenon hexafluoride and photosynthesis of krypton difluoride in liquefied fluorine are important landmarks. The latter is still valid today as the most successful method for the synthesis of krypton difluoride. One hundred fold greater quantities can be prepared than with other methods, resulting in extensive investigations of high energy oxidizers. This has led, in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley, to the synthesis and characterization of a series of higher binary fluorides of silver, copper and nickel - a highly significant achievement. Fluorination reactions of organic molecules are also studied, including an important long-term collaboration with BASF investigating the fluorination of polymeric materials. The Institute is known internationally for its contribution to the processing of ceramics and specialized alloys. The most important scientific achievements include the synthesis of microwave dielectric ceramics and establishing a correlation between their structure and properties, the explanation of the positive temperature coefficient of resistance for ferroelectric ceramics and a contribution to understanding ceramic toughness. Recently much effort has been put into the synthesis of nanocrystalline particles, into ferroelectric thin films for micro-sensors and micro-actuators, and into bio-compatible materials. Protection of the environment and the development of clean, environment-friendly technologies rank high in the chemists' concerns. Desulphurization of chimney gases, selective thermal decomposition of nitrogen oxides, environment friendly incineration of solid and liquid wastes and the use of chemical monitoring in the management of technological processes are typical examples of helping to minimize industrial pollution. More basic research includes studies of catalytic reactions associated with environmental pollution. An important thrust is the development and use of analytical methods for determining elements and their chemical species, radionuclides and organic pollutants in the biosphere. By measuring stable isotopes, sources of pollution can be detected and the paleoclimatic background can be studied. The results are used primarily for modelling natural processes and for evaluating influences of industrial intervention on the environment. Industrial and health associated projects include studies of the processes of corrosion and of passivation of technologically important metals and alloys, such as in solid protection layers, metal and polymer orthopaedic implants, and primary zinc batteries.

Welcome to our picturesque villages, where a delicious aroma of homemade bread still spreads from the houses, where nature\u2019s greenness has no end, and where songs still brighten men\u2019s hearts! We would like to invite you on a walk from the ancient Kun\u0161perk to the charming avenue Klestje. Our walk begins in Bistrica ob Sotli, which is also the seat of the local municipality. The area, sculpted by two rivers \u2013 torrential and unforgiving Bistrica and at times swift, but also lazy, Sotla \u2013 offers numerous experiences, among them also the walk that you are just starting.     Where does the learning path lead?     Learning path Kun\u0161perk-Klestje was established during the project, \u201cRemember the villages,\u201d showcasing the gems of the flatlands, where Obsotelje and Kozjansko meet, was conceptualised as an easy hiking trail, without significant climbs, and is therefore suitable for any hiker or visitor. The path offers various stops, worthy of a closer look. As we have already mentioned, it starts it meandering in Bistrica ob Sotli, approaches the wetland meadows, and takes us on a tour of discovery of the historically important settlement Kun\u0161perk and the famous Kun\u0161per\u0161ka gora. All of a sudden, it turns into a narrow, mysterious canyon Zelenjak, stops at the Sotla meanders, teeming with life, and, after a walk among the flatland fields, reaches the avenue Klestje and the final, panoramic spot, where you will have an excellent view of the local sights. The path will take you across the landscape where Alpine and Pannonian worlds meet, which is included in one of the oldest protected natural park areas in Slovenia \u2013 Kozjanski Park and the area of Nature 2000.     How to orientate ourselves along the way?     Special signs mark individual stops, also describing the local natural or cultural and historical sights and features, like the most important local animal and plant species. Those of you that like electronic guides can access additional information with the help of QR codes located on every sign. Furthermore, we also provide printed maps of the path, which can help with the orientation. You can also visit our website, www.nepozabimovasi.si, where you will find descriptions from the signs along the path and additional descriptions of the path from the printed version that you are currently holding. You can take your time to browse the website in peace, before or after the walk, from the comfort of your sofa, during your stay in the surrounding area or in the nearby resort. Of course, these \u201caccessories\u201d only provide additional help, as these small villages are characterised by friendly and open people. For any further instructions and additional information, you may ask the locals working at the Municipality of Bistrica ob Sotli, where they know anything and everything regarding the local tourist offer, or the local experts in nearby bars.     Enjoy yourself!     You will be walking through nature, and even the curious and fans of traditional Slovenian landscape will find something for their tastes, but above all, you will be able to relax. This is your day, and you can spend it as you wish: some will spend it in a group of friends having fun, some will have some quality time with family and their youngest, and some will simply take a relaxing walk to gather their strength. Take a look around and take advantage of this visit, to a quite remote, but very beautiful part of Slovenia, by Bistrica and Sotla. Natural and cultural heritage offer something special for everybody.     Leaning path Kun\u0161perk - Klestje     Operacijo delno financira Evropska unija iz Evropskega sklada za regionalni razvoj.

With continued use, you agree to the use of cookies.     SOL\u010cAVA HIKING AND CYCLING FESTIVAL     Company     Logarska dolina d.o.o. is a non-profit private company that brings together partners that are mostly local landowners. Ever since its establishment, it has invested all of the funds it obtains in protecting nature, managing infrastructure and preparing and implementing programmes for the sustainable development of the park and the region surrounding it.     In 1987, the Municipality of Mozirje established the Logar Valley Landscape Park, but this did not solve the problems in relation to tourism, as the municipal ordinance did not provide for the funding of the operation of the park. In 1992, the locals therefore reached an agreement on development goals, established the company and obtained a management concession from the governing municipality. The development of the park, which has a significant effect on the wider area, is based on a balance between ecological, social and economic content and the participation of the competent organisations.     The company works closely with numerous organisations and individuals engaged in the sustainable development of similar regions. The Park is a member of the Alpine Network of Protected Areas. Logarska d.o.o. is one of the petitioners for the establishment of a regional park with the neighbouring municipalities in the Kamnik-Savinja Alps. In 2005, it received the highest award from CIPRA International in the area of Alpine protected areas for its innovative management of a protected area and its successful operation. "

In prav zato smo na\u0161pi\u010dile u\u0161esa, ko smo sli\u0161ale, da se vsakih 20 sekund proda ena stekleni\u010dka Cleanse & Polish Hot Cloth Cleanser-ja od znamke Liz Earle.     Tekom let je \u010distilo Cleanse & Polish postal nepogre\u0161ljiv izdelek zaradi njegove sposobnosti temeljitega \u010di\u0161\u010denja ko\u017ee. Priljubljenost \u010distilnega sredstva pa niti ni tako presene\u010denje, saj je v zadnjih 20-ih letih prejel kar 125 nagrad.     \u010cistilo vsebuje ro\u017emarin, kamilico in evkaliptus, kar pomeni, da ima izjemno pomirjujo\u010d vonj.

V podkastu \u0160tevilke     The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

        "text":" About organ donation     Organ and tissue transplantation is a treatment method aimed at restoring certain functions of the human body by the transfer of a part of the donor\u2019s body into the body of the recipient. The process of transplantation is inseparably linked with the process of organ donation, where the donor, while still alive or after death, donates a body part for the purpose of transplantation. The person who receives a part of the donor\u2019s body for therapeutic purposes is called the recipient. Organ and tissue donation is possible only with the prior consent to donation, given by the donor signing the donor statement while still alive, or by the donor\u2019s family consenting to donation after the donor\u2019s death.     Donation and transplantation of organs, tissues and cells is founded on the principles of voluntary and unpaid donation, altruism, professionalism, efficiency, ethics, and transparency.     In Slovenia, it is possible to donate the following organs: heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and pancreas. Tissues and cells that can be donated include corneas, skin, bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, haematopoietic stem cells, blood cells, heart valves, and vessels.     Modern medicine accepts brain death, defined as the final and irreversible cessation of function of the entire brain (both hemispheres and the brainstem), as the death of an individual. The functioning of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in a brain-dead patient can be artificially maintained. Brain death occurs as a consequence of the cessation of blood flow through the brain or prolonged shortage of oxygen supply to the brain. The most frequent causes of brain death are cerebral haemorrhage, serious brain injury, stroke, malignant intracranial tumours, and ischaemic brain damage.     The method of determining brain death is laid down by a special regulation, which defines the medical criteria, procedure, structure of the appropriate commission, and the clinical tests that must be performed to establish the diagnosis. For the definitive diagnosis, an ancillary investigation is usually required to demonstrate the cessation of intracranial blood flow (EEG, perfusion scintigraphy, CT angiography, transcranial US).     Organ donation after brain death can take place only once brain death has been unequivocally demonstrated. For organ and tissue donation after death, prior consent must be obtained in a legally prescribed form from either the donor while still alive, or from the donor\u2019s family after the donor\u2019s confirmed brain death. Organ retrieval surgery is conducted as a surgical procedure for which the same requirements must be fulfilled as for any other operation. The only visible mark after organ donation is the surgical incision. The entire donation process is carried out with respect, safeguarding the dignity of the donor and the family of the deceased.     Living donation is defined as donation to a person with whom the donor is genetically or emotionally related. The risk to the donor\u2019s health must remain within medically acceptable limits. To prevent abuse, each case of living donation is considered separately by the Transplant Ethics Committee.     The only organs that can be donated during lifetime are a kidney, a lung, and parts of the liver, pancreas and bowel. The tissues and cells that can be donated while alive include skin, blood, and haematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow).     Schematic presentation of organ donation and transplantation     History of transplantation activities in Slovenia     1952     The first cornea transplant is performed in Slovenia.     Corneas are currently transplanted in three centres: Ljubljana, Maribor and Novo mesto.     1969     A Tissue Typing Laboratory, headed by Prof. Mateja Bohinc, is set up in the national Blood Transfusion Centre.     1970     The first successful kidney transplant is performed in the University Medical Centre (UMC) Ljubljana; the kidney was removed from an HLA-compatible living donor.     1985     The first national transplant law comes into force in the former Yugoslavia.     1986     A brain death determination protocol is adopted, which opens the way for organ transplantation from brain dead donors.     The first deceased donor kidney is transplanted.     1988     First bone marrow removal for autologous stem cell transplantation.     1989     First autologous stem cell transplantation, and first related allogeneic stem cell transplantation.     A national registry of unrelated haematopoietic stem cell donors, Slovenia Donor, is established. The registry, operated by the Tissue Typing Laboratory, still functions at present.     1990     First successful heart and pancreas transplants in Slovenia, performed in UMC Ljubljana.     With the accelerated development of transplantation activities, there emerged a need for better organisation and closer surveillance of donation and transplantation services.     1992     Expert Advisory Committee for Transplantation is established. The Committee, chaired by Jasna Von\u010dina, MD, sets up the national transplant network and organizes 24-hour coordination of activities.     1995     First liver transplantation in Slovenia, carried out by a team of Slovenian surgeons led by Dr Belghiti from France.     1997     A 24-hour coordination service for transplantation activity with administrative support is set up.     1998     The transplantation service is transformed into a transplant centre, run within the Division of Surgery, UMC Ljubljana.     The national donor network is launched, with the official appointment of hospital transplant coordinators in donor hospitals across Slovenia.     First independent liver transplantation in Slovenia, performed by a team of Slovenian abdominal surgeons and gastroenterologists, unassisted by a foreign specialist.     2000     Slovenia meets requirements for full membership in Eurotransplant, and a cooperation agreement is signed between Eurotransplant and the UMC Ljubljana.     2002     Slovenia Transplant is founded, and a new cooperation agreement is signed between Eurotransplant and Slovenia Transplant.     Organ and tissue donation and transplantation are processes that are inseparably connected with one another. Transplantation is a surgical procedure whereby a damaged organ is replaced with a healthy one recovered from a deceased or living donor. For patients with irreversibly damaged organs as a consequence of various diseases, in whom all other treatment options have been exhausted, organ transplantation represents the only effective treatment method.

Primo\u017e nad Muto is not a well-known excursion point, which really baffles us, since there are many well-marked hiking and biking trails. The hike itself is not demanding, however, with little children trudging next to you, it will take about 1.5-2 hours of walk to arrive to the finish line.     This family trip is suitable for children over 4 years of age, or if you are stubborn or persistent enough, for all parents who are ready to strap on a baby carrier or push the baby stroller up a hill.     Interesting Facts     The Mitnica Muta Sports and Tourist Park and the Rotunda St. John the Baptist     The Mitnica Sports and Tourist Park in Muta and its pier on the Drava River was built by the Municipality of Muta with the help of ERDF (European Regional Development Fund). This project was called Drava as an Opportunity. Take a few steps in another direction and visit the rotunda, which is a very interesting church of St. John the Baptist.     The church is situated at the mouth of Drava River and it attracts the attention of passers-by with its round nave and a beautiful shingle roof with a roof belfry.     Take a walk through the sports and tourist park along the banks of the Bistrica Stream and Drava River, see interesting photos on tourist boards and relax with an excellent coffee or a refreshing drink on the most beautiful terrace in the Drava Valley. Attend a variety of outdoor events - in the natural amphitheatre or on the nearby sports field (Source: Drava Bike website).

Basic data analysis     Basic data analysis can be performed directly in the application, namely within the tab 'ANALYSIS' - 'Statistics'. Here you can find:     'Summary': the 'Sums' function generates a summary of your survey analysis and is automatically generated when you open the 'Statistics' tab.     'Descriptives': descriptive statistics are generated for each variable separately, such as the number of units, average, standard deviation, minimum and maximum.     'Frequencies': the frequency, i.e. the number of times that a response was selected, is displayed for answers for each variable.     'Crosstabs': these are contingency tables: first select the independent variable, then the dependent variable. The analysis of the overall results will be shown, and will establish if there is a correlation between the two variables or not.     'Multitables': this is a multi-dimensional table of categorical variables. You can select multiple variables and the table will show the total results.     'Means': this option allows you to generate calculations of averages by groups. First you select the independent variable, i.e. label it as a category, and then select the dependent variable.     'T-test': allows you to verify the assumptions of statistical differences for two variables.     'Break': the analysis is broken based on the control variable. Select the variable by which you would like to break your information from the drop-down list.     For each analysis the results can be exported to PDF, MS Word and MS Excel formats. You can also create a link that you forward to selected individuals to give them an insight into these results\/analysis, but this does not mean that they have access to your survey. Each table or chart can also be included in 'Custom Reports'. "

At the same time, efficient energy usage is becoming ever more important. People want a safe, comfortable and sustainable place for life and work.     However, more comfort and security coupled with reduced power consumption can only be achieved with intelligent management and control of all devices in the system. This is a challenge, because for classical systems this implies more wiring from the sensors and actuators to control centres and devices. For experts this also means harder planning and mounting, increased risk of fire and increasing costs. Here is where KNX steps in!     Automation does not need to be difficult. Automation requires a system that solves problems with isolated devices in a way that enables all devices to communicate using one common language. The type of the device that you wish to use is irrelevant. There are many options for creating a smart home or a smart office. Implement a simple lighting management system or connect different devices to your KNX system. KNX enables automation on a high level. Contact us!     Do you wish to control lighting, blinds, security systems, energy consumption, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning systems, signal and control systems, remote control or video surveillance? All functions operate using a unified system. This is a simple automation of residential or office premises. This is KNX.     KNX \u2013 the world standard for residential and office premises control     The KNX organization was formed in 1990 in Brussels, at the time known as EIB organization. The goal of EIB was to promote smart facilities, especially the EIB system. In 1999 the EIB organization was merged with the BCI company which was promoting the BatiBUS system and the EHSA organization. The result of the merger is the KNX organization as we know it today. The KNX standard was built based on the EIB communication protocol combined with the experience in BatiBUS and EHS system applications usage. A KNX installation can use several different media:     Z     Twisted pair     Z     Electrical installation     Z     Radio waves     Z     IP network     The most commonly used medium for communication in a KNX system is a twisted pair wiring. KNX standard is approved by the following organizaitons:     CHPLE- 08\/02.2.00     Functions: ON\/OFF, dimming, blind control, scene change, logical functions     LED indicators     Built-in temperature sensor     KNX module selection consulting     We supply MEAN WELL and GVS KNX modules. We also offer consulting in KNX module selection that will match your requirements. The offer includes modules divided into following categories:     KNX actuators     KNX switches and touchscreens     Programming and testing of KNX modules     As a KNX partner we offer programming and testing of KNX modules. The KNX system integrator will ensure uninterrupted operation of your smart installation. We work with ETS software. During the programming process we perform the following steps for system implementation:     Fabrication of building and system structure topology     Assignment of physical addresses to all modules based on the topology of the KNX bus.

Resitev prinasa silicijev aerogel, porozna snov z lomnim kolicnikom med 1,005 in 1,06. Rezultati, dobljeni pri eksperimentih HERMES in BELLE kazejo, da bi bilo smiselno tak sevalec uporabiti tudi v detektorju Cerenkovih obrocev s tankim sevalcem brez fokusiranja s sistemom zrcal (t.i. proximity focusing RICH). Prednost takega tipa detektorjev je v kompaktnosti, ki je posebej pomembna pri spektrometrih ob visokoenergijskih trkalnikih. Z uporabo boljsih aerogelov ter v zadnjem casu razvitih vecanodnih fotopomno?evalk nameravamo razviti uporabno metodo za detekcijo Cerenkovih fotonov. Pri tem bomo za odpravo ucinka neaktivne povrsine fotopomnozevalk uporabili sistem zbiralnih lec. Razvoj stevca Cerenkovih fotonov ponuja potencialno uporabo pri detekciji izvorov beta. Posebej zanimiva je detekcija visoko radiotoksicnega izotopa Sr-90 v okolju. Z izbiro aerogela s primernim lomnim kolicnikom lahko dosezemo, da le beta elektroni z dovolj visoko energijo sevajo cerenkove fotone, tako je na primer prag v aerogelu z lomnim kolicnikom n=1,06 pri 1 MeV. Na ta nacin lahko locimo prispevke razlicnih radioaktivnih izotopov. V okviru predlaganega projekta bomo z modeliranjem fizikalnih procesov, ki jih povzrocijo beta elektroni, ter ozadja zarkov gama in kozmicnih delcev, optimizirali parametre detektorja.     Summary     Cherenkov radiation caused by fast charged particles in a transparent medium is the basis for different methods of particle identifiaction. Up to the present, gaseous and solid (or liquid) radiators have been used as sources of Cherenkov radiation. The threshold for photon emission of pions is above 2.5 GeV\/c in gases and below 0.2 GeV\/c in solids (or liquids). The intermediate uncovered gap is essential for the investigation of rare B meson decays, which are the research subject of many experiments, some in progress, others in preparation. A solution to the problem is offered by silica aerogels, a porous material with refractive index between 1.005 and 1.06. The results obtained in two particle physics experiments, HERMES and BELLE indicate that it would be meaningful to use such a radiator also in Cherenkov detectors with thin radiators without focusing systems of mirrors (so called proximity focusing RICH).The advantage of such detectors is their compactness, which is especially important for experiments at the high energy colliders. By making use of improved aerogels, recently developed multianode photomultiplier tubes and additional lens systems for elimination of the inefficiency due to the PMT inactive surface, we propose to develop a method for detection of Cherenkov photons. A possible application of the Cherenkov photon detector could be for detection of beta particles. Of special interest is the detection of the highly radiotoxic isotope Sr-90 in the environment. A choice of aerogel with suitable refractive index allows one to select the threshold energy of beta electrons, which would radiate Cherenkov photons. Thus one may separate the contributions of different radioactive isotopes, in particular the rather energetic ones from Sr-90 daughter isotope Y-90. By modeling the physical processes produced by beta electrons and the gamma and cosmic ray backgrounds, we intend to optimize the detector parameters to allow for quick measurements of low activities of the isotope Sr-90 in environmental samples.

        "text":" In the photogrammetry for the creation of point clouds, digital 3D models and orthophoto maps stereo pairs of aerial photos are used. These are two aerial photos showing part of the same area and the coverage position is somewhat offset. The area that is overlapped for the forward should be between 60-70 %. It is used for the stereoscopic view and complete coverage of the area of interest. The area that is overlapped for the sidelap should be between 25-40 %. It is used to ensure that no area is left unphotographed.     In an ideal case, an unmanned aircraft flies along straight and parallel lines in accordance with a flight plan. While in real circumstances, the aircraft (and camera within) direction and position can be disturbed by external factors causing anomalies in the overlapping of aerial photo pairs. When capturing aerial photos, we encounter two typical phenomena, which are the cause of the coverage errors. This is about Drift and Crab.     Drift Drift is the lateral shift or displacement of the aircraft from the planned flight lines that may be caused by the blowing wind or by the navigational errors. Drift may cause a serious gap between adjoining strips of photographs. Uncorrected drift results in subsequent photos covering more area in the prevailing wind direction.     Crab During side winds, if the pilot tries to maintain the original path, he has to turn the nose of the aircraft slightly against the wind. This makes the aircraft to rotate on its vertical axis. In this case, the original path is maintained, but the area covered by the aerial photo is much different from that planned originally. The photograph is rotated in the direction opposite to wind direction here. This defect is called as crab.     Crab occurs when the aircraft is not oriented with flightline. It causes a reduction in a stereoscopic coverage of the terrain. It can be corrected by rotating the camera around the vertical axis.     Drift is the result of not be able the unmanned aircraft to keep the planned navigation bearing. While crab is the result of being able to keep the planned navigation bearing but because of side winds, it doesn\u2019t have an alignment yaw position with the bearing. Because of extensive crosswinds, there is a great possibility that we will have a combination of the two situations, drift, and crab.     So it is said that it is good practice to capture aerial photos in calm weather conditions with as little wind as possible. In the case of excessive drift and, consequently, crab, it is often necessary to repeat aerial survey.     In order to eliminate these problems, modern unmanned aircrafts are already equipped with appropriate technological solutions. Among them, 3-axis camera stabilizer or gimbal is very effective. It is an electronic system that stabilizes the camera with the aid of gyros and electric motors so that it always keeps its horizontal position and proper orientation despite the drift or crab of the aircraft.

Second, mathematical models and computers today allow for detailed understanding of the most complicated environmental phenomena (e.g. typhoons), prediction of the evolution of the environmental processes (e.g. global warming), quantitative assessment of intrusions in the environment as well as control of the environmental processes (e.g. wastewater treatment plants). The course will get students acquainted with elementary modelling approaches based on first principles, initial skills in computer simulation of dynamic systems as well as ability to identify (simple) models from data.     Prerequisites     Since the topic is multi-disciplinary, it assumes the students are familiar with fundamentals obtained in the courses of Mathematics and Physics as well as Statistics and Computer Science. Knowledge that the student gets in this course is generic and usable in almost every area of environmental sciences.     Content (Syllabus outline)     Functions and their representation     Preliminaries in differential and integral calculus and ordinary differential equations     Theoretical (analytical) models     Basics of numerical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations     Modelling the transport phenomena     Physical, chemical and biological transformation of matter     Intended learning outcomes     Students will acquire:     the ability to set up the mathematical model from process description and inventory of physical phenomena,     the capacity to implement a model in simulation tool,     students will become familiar with model assessment in the context of application,     capacity to callibrate simple static models from data.

Church leaders raised concerns that a growing number of parents who discover their child will be born with the condition are choosing to terminate the pregnancy, a pattern which could see it wiped out completely.     Its governing body will debate a call to regulate providers of non-invasive prenatal testing, a relatively new test for the condition which carries no risk of miscarriage, unlike older procedures such as amniocentesis.     The Church said women should be provided with \"comprehensive, unbiased information\" by doctors and test providers.     In a document entitled Valuing People with Down\u2019s Syndrome, set to be debated at next month's General Synod, the Church warned that the test \"has the potential to lead to major reductions of Down\u2019s syndrome live births.     \"In countries such as Iceland and Denmark, which have almost universal screening and close to 100 per cent termination rates, there is a real possibility that people with Down\u2019s syndrome will effectively disappear from their populations,\" it added.     Speaking at a press briefing, Brendan McCarthy, the church\u2019s national adviser on medical ethics and social policy, said he had found unregulated websites offering to test a blood sample for a few hundred pounds with no context or information about the prospects for someone with Down's Syndrome.     He said the provision of neutral information reflected NHS \"best practice\" but that anecdotal evidence suggested some doctors were presenting a diagnosis as \"bad news\" and immediately initiating conversations about termination, which could put parents under pressure.     Pointing to figures showing an increase in abortions due to Down's Syndrome, he said that in 2010 there were 482 terminations of pregnancy because of a diagnosis of the condition. In 2016 there were 706.

However, Jane Fisher, director of advisory charity Antenatal Results and Choices said she thought the proposal was \"patronising\".     \"In our experience women and couples do everything they can do investigate what that diagnosis would mean and they base their decisions on accurate information. There's been a lot of this messaging over the last year or so which makes women and couples feel an extra level of distress,\" she said.     \"It kind of denies their agency to say that they just do what their health professionals tell them.\"     Dawn McAvoy, co-founder of pro-life group Both Lives Matter, welcomed the announcement.     \"Undoubtedly there has been a silence on the Protestant denominations, more than the Roman Catholic church so we would welcome any statement that would advocate the humanity of the pre-born child and value their life,\" she said.

On the last day, prof. Janez Ko\u017eelj, vice-mayor of the City of Ljubljana, mayor Miha Je\u0161a of \u0160kofja Loka and mayor of Roberto Felcaro of Cormons in Italy spoke at Franja Academy. Felcaro together with local partners from the Unione Italiana sport per tutti received the award for the best performed My Sport is Franja cycling event abroad. Gorazd Penko (director Marathon Franja) and Maja Oven (BTC City) gave the award which represented five free tickets to Marathon Franja BTC City. The Franja event in Cormons in May attracted the most participants of the four Franja events abroad.     Franja Academy 2017 featured no less than 38 speakers. Among them Jesus Freire (representative of the European Cycling Federation ECF), Fabio Gon (Italian Federation Amici della Bicicletta, member of the FIAB National Committee), Paco Wrolich (bike tourism coordinator for Carinthia), Christopher Enzi (Tourism Klagenfurt), Helena He\u010dimovi\u0107 (municipality of Koprvnica, Croatia), Miroslav Cerar (president of the Slovenian Olympic Committee), Toma\u017e Pavlin (Sport Museum of Slovenia), Peter Dakskobler (Odprimopoti.si), Du\u0161an Strucl and Marko Lenar\u010di\u010d (Hiking and Biking Slovenia), Martin \u010cotar (Development Agency for Tourism Istra), Jana Jegli\u010d (Development Information Center Slovenska Bistrica), Nata\u0161a Jurgec Gurnick (Ministry of Culture), Ma\u0161a Ekar (Motivila) and Dijana Pita da Costa (Heritage Advisor).     Through videoconference, a live interview could be made with Amedeo Polito, the global event coordinator of L\u2019Eroica. Politio presented the development of his event which is the biggest event in the world for vintage race bikes. L\u2019Eroica also has a major impact on bike tourism in Tuscany in Italy.     Franja Academy is part of the two-year European project My sport is Franja and is supported with the Erasmus + program. The project is a cooperation of five partners: cycling club Rog from Ljubljana, Unione Italiana sport per tutti from Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the Sports Association of the Istrian Region, Sportunion Carinthia and the Slovak Cycling Federation. There were 34 representatives of the partner organizations at the conference. Partners also brought experts who gave their views on de development of bike tourism and connecting cultural heritage and cycling.     The representatives of the partners also visited Partisan Hospital Franja and they went on a bike tour in Ljubljana past the works of architect Ple\u010dnik.     New at Franja Academy 2017 was a bike exhibition. More than a hundred visitors were counted at the My Bike, My Heritage exhibition where visitors were taken on a trip through the history of (Slovenian) cycling with bikes, jerseys, pictures and videos. The exhibition visualized the cultural values and heritage of the sport of cycling, with an emphasis on Slovenia, cycling club Rog and Marathon Franja.     For many Slovenians, the name \u201cFranja\u201d represents more than just a sporting event; over time, the name has become a symbol of the Slovenian sports and folk culture. Powered by the spirit of Marathon Franja Samo Kofol and Mark Koghee designed this year\u2019s Academy program.     The long-term goal of the My Sport is Franja project is that the name Franja becomes a recognizable name in sport in Europe. Anyone can express support for this by signing the petition \u201cSignature for Franja\u201d. With smartphone or on the website. "

The process was tested in a pilot-scale reactor with a design organic load of 16.0 kg\/m3\/day of COD. Through various stages of the experiment, several possible scenarios were tested, excess yeast was added continuously with concentrations up to 3 vol. %, whereas waste ethanol was added in batches of up to 0.8 % of daily volume load several days a week. The intent was to test real conditions in the treatment process. The whole experiment lasted for 77 days, where the maximum organic load of 24.72 kg\/m3\/day was successfully achieved with no adverse effects on the efficiency of the reactor performance although it significantly surpassed the design load. The COD efficiency at maximum OLR was 83.1 %, whereas the average was 88.0 %. The average biogas production rate increased from 2,044 m3\/m3\/day to 4.927 m3\/m3\/day. The microbial community structure analysis showed significant shifts only in the archaeal community (25 \u2013 30 %) as a good adaptation to the addition of substrates. Monitoring the model brewery in applying the addition of yeast and ethanol to the wastewater treatment showed a 110 % increase in biomethane production. The consequence of the increased biomethane production is that the natural gas substitute ratio could be increased from the current average of 10.7 % to potentially 20.1 %, which is a substantial step towards the goal of renewable energy use.

        "text":" How to create a convincing r\u00e9sum\u00e9     An excellent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is the first step to achieving the career change you want. However it should be noted that HR managers receive numerous job applications every day and only spend a few moments looking at each one. If your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 does not grab their attention in those first few moments, where they can quickly see your relevant experiences, expertise and skills, it is likely that your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will be archived and stay there.     Below we have presented some useful tips on how to create a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that will stand out in the eyes of employers and guarantee you access to the best job positions.     1. Stick to the point!     An employer want to know exactly what you can do for their company, that is why you have to focus on your professional expertise, skills and especially any special achievements in your career that may be interesting for your employer or correspond to any of the requirements of the job position. Stick to the point! The best r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is one that is tailored to each employer. Avoid giving irrelevant information to the employer.     2. Say who you are straight away     Besides the standard topics such as:     Personal contact information (e-mail and mobile phone are required),     An overview of relevant work experience,     Formal and informal education, and     A description of expertise, professional and personal skills,     your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should include your profile right at the start. This is a sort of summary of your career with a punchy title in which you present your unique value to the employer in three to four sentences; what are your key features and qualifications and how you see your career path developing.     3. Consistency demonstrates your professionalism     A modern r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should not be longer than two A4 pages, should be logically structured, easy to read and nicely designed. Consistency throughout the document demonstrates your professionalism, so make sure you clearly define each section, use lists with markers and stay consistent with the use of font, spacing between lines, symbols and colours. Emphasise keywords with bold type and be especially careful that the text does not contain grammatical and spelling errors.     4. Build on your personal brand     A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is a tool that you can use to promote your personal brand in the eyes of an employer. In addition to having an excellent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter, your web presence (active participation in professional associations, conferences, writing articles or a blog, as well as a well-made profile on social media such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter) can significantly benefit your image as seen by an employer. The majority of employers look online to find relevant information about a candidat "

Museum of Contemporary Art, Lotty Rosenfeld, Martina Ruhsam & Vlado Repnik, \u0160kart, Endre T\u00f3t, Goran Trbuljak, \u017delimir \u017dilnik, a selection of videos from the EVR Archive, and the Museum in the Streets archive     Starting on Friday, 18 January 2013, our exhibition The Present and Presence is on view with a new twist: Repetition 3 - The Street. Works have been added or brought into focus in two rooms on the first floor and on the ground floor of the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova, where you will also find Dan Perjovschi's poster. The film by Nu\u0161a and Sre\u010do Dragan is screened at the Moderna galerija, Cankarjeva 15. The works comprising the Repetition 3 - The Street selection are marked with Dan Perjovschi's stamp.     The exhibition The Present and Presence: Repetition 3 - The Street again focuses on lived time, this time limiting the presentation to the works made in public space - more specifically, in the streets. Included in this new display of works largely from the Moderna galerija national collection and the Arteast 2000+ collection is the archive of the project Museum in the Streets, organized by Moderna galerija in 2008, during the renovation of our main museum building, when no funding was allotted for the exhibitions program.     The reason Repetition 3 is so focused on art in the streets is quite plain. Over the last two years, the streets have, once again, become our other physical body, not only in Slovenia, but all over the world: a physical space where we breathe the same air as the others, where we are relearning to shout, where we write our own placards and pick out favorites among those written by others. After we had, it seemed, teetered on the brink of losing the streets and the squares, when we seemed to have moved into virtual worlds, the physical world has again started to recoup its value. The good old streets are accessible to the poor and the rich alike, to the old and the young, to those on Facebook and those without profiles. Everyone can bring their body, their voice, their thought, and their anger to the streets and the squares; and it works like group therapy, where every gesture, at least momentarily, seems to be effective and to serve some common goal. We have almost forgotten how important it is to express ourselves, and express ourselves with our entire bodies. We are relearning participation, endurance, and repetition. With every demonstration it is becoming increasingly clear that what we are seeing happening in the streets in Slovenia is not merely a revolt against the politics of austerity measures and cuts in public funding, most acutely felt in education, healthcare, and culture. The people in the streets are rebelling against neoliberal autocrats and corrupt(ed) powers that be, and merging into a forum demanding the preservation of the fundamental basis of the democratic state: the rule of law and equality in access to education, healthcare, and culture for all.     During the time of socialist rule, the public manifestations carried out in the streets by the artists from Eastern Europe, whose works are kept in our Arteast 2000+ collection, were gestures for democracy. When three members of the OHO Group draped themselves in black fabric in 1968, to enact, with their bodies unified into one with their three heads sticking out, the three-headed Mt Triglav, a symbol of Slovenia, their act presented a disruption in the gray everyday socialist life in Ljubljana. Tomislav Gotovac protested against the lack of freedom by streaking through the streets of Belgrade, and Milan Kn\u00ed\u017e\u00e1k by inviting passersby to join him in his demonstration by crowing. Endre T\u00f3t staged demonstrations carrying placards with zeros written on them. At a recent demonstration in Ljubljana, the group Irwin carried placards with the circular scheme of the Coca-Cola bottle top and a slogan taken from a campaign for the same beverage: Time for a New State. While T\u00f3t's zeros stood, decades ago, for empty ideological speech, the Coca-Cola bottle-top circles speak of the invisible power of multinational capital. In another totalitarian regime, Lotty Rosenfeld used white tape to make large white crosses in the streets; her performance carried great symbolic weight and meaning under Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. The Chto Delat? platform organized a visualization of a Brecht poem in St. Petersburg in 2005; the poem was displayed by \"engaged\" sandwich people on the same spot where the Russian Revolution had begun 100 years earlier. During the time of the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime in Serbia, the \u0160kart collective carried out the notorious street action Your Shit - Your Responsibility, and Vlado Repnik and Martina Ruhsam organized the Blank_Protest in 2008, a demonstration without any demands or slogans, representing an \"anomaly in the dictionary of political jargon\".     The Present and Presence: Repetition 3 - The Street also includes the archive of the Museum in the Streets show from 2008. During the renovation of the Moderna galerija's main (and then only) building, the Ministry of Culture did not provide a venue or funding for our public program. For this reason we decided to organize the Museum in the Streets project, to draw attention to our situation: the central national institution for modern and contemporary art was closed for three years and would have remained virtually without program if not for such near-protest projects. That (unsupported) situation has again repeated itself over the past two years since our Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova opened. We now have twice the exhibition space to work in, but not a single additional employee, while our program funds have been reduced to less than the total we were allotted while working in just a single building. The history of street art helps us develop our potential of free creativity under conditions in which art and culture are losing the support and protection that would (otherwise) enable them to carry out their vital public mission.

        "text":" What is the CLARIN.SI repository?     The CLARIN.SI repository is like a library for linguistic data and tools. It is provided by CLARIN.SI, the Slovenian Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure.     You can use the repository to:     search for linguistic data and tools and easily download them;     deposit your data or tools being sure that it is safely stored, and that everyone can find it, use it, and correctly cite it (giving you credit).     What kinds of submissions does CLARIN.SI accept?     We accept any linguistic and\/or NLP data and tools: corpora, treebanks, lexica, machine readable dictionaries etc., trained language models, and programs for processing language data. The CLARIN.SI repository also supports e-signature of licences for immediate access to restricted resources.     When depositing items to the CLARIN.SI repository, please first carefully read the guidelines on How to Deposit that explain the process of submitting an item and the requirements on its metadata, while the structure and accepted formats of the data itself are given in the CLARIN.SI guidelines for data submissions.     Do I need to create an account to download and\/or make a submission?     You can download data and tools which have a license that allows free sharing without a log-in. Please read the license prior to downloading the resource. This applies to all data with one of the Creative Commons licences and to tools with open source licenses.     To download data and tools that require you to sign a license, you need to log in. To make a submission, you also need to log in. However, if you are affiliated with an academic institution you probably don't need a new account.     Just click \"Login\" in the upper right corner and search for your academic institution. To log-in, you can use any account with an Identity Provider that is a member of EduGAIN federation.     If you don't have an academic account, you can get one through CLARIN ERIC.     I see an error logging in.     Please let us know through our Help Desk, if you have any trouble logging in.     Occasionally, usually when you are the first one logging in using your home institution, you might see an error stating \"The authentication was successful; however, your identity provider did provide neither your email, eppn nor targeted id.\" This means your home institution did not send us enough data about you to operate our service; the institution is doing so to protect your personal data. We only require an email and we are following Data Protection Code of Conduct, which helps us convince the institution we won't abuse data about you.     If you have an account with multiple providers and you login with different one each time, you might see error stating \"Your email is already associated with a different user\". Please try to use the same provider each time. However, if that is not possible, let us know and we will change your default provider.     Why should I submit my data into CLARIN.SI repository?     Here are some of the reasons why submitting to CLARIN.SI repository is a good choice.     It is free and safe.     We respect your license. We encourage Free Data and believe it benefits not only the users, but also the data providers. However, we accept also more restricted data and we can make users sign a license before downloading your data, if that is what you need.     The data is visible, giving you maximal credit for your work, also via other services, such as Google, VLO, DataCite, OLAC, Data Citation Index, and arXive.     The data is easy to cite. We provide ready-to-use one-click citations in BibTex, RIS, and other popular reference formats. All the citations include permanent links created from persistent identifiers (we use handles for PIDs). These PIDs are future-proof.     For some data types (in particular, text corpora), we can provide additional services, like a concordance search.     Why should I submit my tools into CLARIN.SI repository?     From the repository entry it is simple to provide a link to your version control system (e.g. GitLab, GitHub, SVN), if it is publicly accessible. You can also link your project page, or demo site. In this way the tools are available in several interlinked places, making them easier to find and safer.     Is there any common search tool across different CLARIN repositories?     Yes, in particular the CLARIN Virtual language observatory or CLARIN VLO for short. This browser helps you find linguistic resources, services and tools provided by CLARIN as well as some other repositories. However, please keep in mind that CLARIN VLO is an aggregator that provides information about a specific resource, but that the source repository, like CLARIN.SI typically gives more information, so it is worth checking also the source repository landing page, as given by CLARIN VLO. Original resources, services and tools are hosted by CLARIN centres and other data providers. This means that you cannot use the services and tools, or search and analyse the resources directly through CLARIN VLO.     There are also other aggregators, such as OpenAIRE, which is a pan-European information platform and a network of Open Access repositories, or re3data, which is a global registry of research data repositories. The main difference between CLARIN VLO and OpenAIRE or re3data is that CARIN VLO focuses on language resources, services and tools, whereas the other two cover all academic disciplines.     If I have my data or programs on GitHub, can I also deposit them on CLARIN.SI?     Yes, there are no constraints with regard to depositing data that is already availble on other platforms. It is good practice to explicitly mention the commit hash that the repository data corresponds to. For example, in this entry the GitHub commit URL is stored as the \"Project URL\", or you can mention the commit checksum in the description of the resource.     Why should I deposit my data with CLARIN.SI rather than with ELRA?     CLARIN and ELRA both provide repositories for language resources but CLARIN always distributes the deposited resources for free and licences are typically CC while ELRA mostly uses a commercial model of resource distribution and offers appropriate licences for such use. Also, the main target communities of CLARIN are those of the Humanities and Social Sciences, while ELRA is exclusively targeted at the Language Engineering community - which is not to say that CLARIN does not also provide many resources for Language Engineering as well.     What is the PID (handle) good for?     It is a special permanent URL. It provides a permanent link that will resolve correctly even if in some distant future the data is moved. Thus it should be used as the entry URL in citations.     What is the actual depositing\/archiving procedure?     After the submission of a language resources or took to the repository, the data undergoes a curation process in order to ensure quality and consistency. We can assist you in meeting necessary requirements for sustainable resource archiving. As explained in the How to Deposit guidelines, the data has to be provided with metadata in standard formats accepted\/adopted in the respective communities, persistent identifiers (PIDs) have to be assigned, IPR issues have to be resolved and clear statements with regard to licensing and possible use of the resources are to be made. The depositor is also required to electronically sign a deposition agreement acknowledging that (s)he is the holder of rights to the data and that (s)he has the right to grant the rights contained in this licence. As soon as a new entry is inititiated, it is assigned a permanent identifier (PID) for stable reference, however, the PID becomes publicly accessible only when the entry has been checked and approved.     What if I want\/need to update the archived data?     Every change to the resources and metadata should be stored as a new version with a new PID. However if the changes are minimal (e.g., typos or clear mistakes) then contact our Help Desk with the submission PID and the changes which should be made. It is up to the reviewer to decide whether these changes should result in a new version or not.     How do I create a new version of a resource?     We do not allow changes in the data (except minor ones, e.g. to fix obvious errors) after a submission was published. For a new version of the resource you should create a new submission, however, you do not (in fact, should not) create a new submission from scratch, but follow the procedure explained in Submitting a new version of an Item.     What if I want to withdraw the resources in the future? Can I delete the data?     Yes, in this case contact our Help Desk with the submission PID and the reason. However, we need to keep a reference that the data was in our repository (because a persistent identifier was issued), so the administrative metadata will be retained indicating that the data itself were removed.     I don't want to\/cannot make the data publicly available or want\/can make them available only after a specific date. Could I still archive them with CLARIN.SI?     In accordance with the advocacy of the research infrastructures and the general development with respect to Open Access, we strongly encourage the data producers to be as open as possible. However, in certain circumstances we will archive your data even if they will not be publicly available. Please, contact our Help Desk prior to completing the submission.     How should I cite a submission?     How safe is my data, if I store it with CLARIN.SI?     Quite safe, probably much more than in your computer, because individual users, contrary to the CLARIN.SI infrastructure, usually do not have a sophisticated security and preservation plans and means for their implementation. Uploading data to CLARIN.SI repository therefore has two main benefits: you can worry much less about unauthorised access to your data, and you do not have to think about backups. The final version of your data (that you submitted to the repository) is always there for you.     You can read more about this in our Preservation Policy.     What license should I pick for my data\/tool?     We encourage using a free license. A representative selection of free licenses as well as CC licenses (more appropriate for data) is available directly during submission. There is a great OPEN License Selector which can guide you through the selection of appropriate license. If for some reason you need a different license, please contact us.     Where can I find more information about supported licenses?     The list of licenses currently supported is here. However, do not hesitate to contact us in case you need a specific license. The licenses can be accompanied by various requirements; e.g., limited to logged-in users, filling additional details (purpose), etc.     Why CLARIN.SI strongly prefers real authors to institutions?     It is not about contact, it is about citations, credit and trust. That is why we have separate metadata fields for authors and for contact person. Contact to a helpdesk is perfect, not acknowledging the authors of a scholarly work is not. We support the direct citation of data. This is why we give PIDs, create formatted citations, etc. This is also the reason why we really want real authors, so that they get citations and other scientists know whose work they rely on.     How do I get the most out of my searches?     In contrast to other search engines the CLARIN.SI repository one uses OR as a default operator; see examples below that clarify this. If you are not satisfied with the results of your searches, you might wish to go beyond plain text searches. You may search only in certain fields, use negation, add score (emphasis) to some parts of the query. The search engine is SOLR, so use its syntax if you know it or check the documentation. The list of Dublin Core (dc.) fields that can be searched is given in Metadata mapping.     Examples:     The default operator is OR; i.e., the first example searches for Slovenian OR lexicon in all metadata text fields.     Returns all items having C?C in the title \u2013 ? stands for any character (e.g., CMC) - and not having training in the title.     Search for items by one author and not the other, while you specify that you are interested only in items that are both in Slovenian and English.     Repository     This platform runs under the software developed for the LINDAT\/CLARIN repository for linguistics, available on GitHub     CLARIN.SI is supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of the Republic of Slovenia under the Programme of \"Research Infrastructures\".

        "text":" ECOHOTEL KORO\u0160 - ARS VIVENDI     \"The Art of Living\"     Although we are clearly bike-oriented, art plays an important role in the life of our family too. Therefore, already when we established our first hotel in \u010crna na Koro\u0161kem we endeavoured to develop an active art gallery within the hotel. The \u010crna gallery saw many artists, from the locally renowned ones to school pupils. Today, we long for a more quiet form of art, light art, art in our everyday life: ARS VIVENDI. When arriving at Ecohotel Koro\u0161, you will undoubtedly notice how art is everywhere without being oppressive. The cycling photographs above your bed are art, aren't they? The totem at the entrance terrace is art, isn't it? And what about Bike Nomad's logo? A drawing representing a bikers' weird dance: both arts! Now have a look outside at our \"ka\u0161\u010da\": this small wooden house is certainly a work of art, a witness from the past. \"Moments to be caught\" - Permanent exhibition from Irena \u010cernov\u0161ek Now go on visiting the hotel. Our club lounge is probably the centre of Ars Vivendi at Koro\u0161. Here you can relax sitting on the sofas, enjoying the landscape through the large windows and admiring various pieces made from light wood and the glittering enamelled clay sculptures. This permanent exhibition is the fabulous work of Irena \u010cernov\u0161ek, a unique local artist and a family friend. Born in 1961, she graduated from the College of Education in Ljubljana, Departement of Art. She works as an art teacher. In her works, she is trying to catch the moments and the transitoriness of the four seasons. She shows them as a symbol of changeability and revival within the endless circle of nature. Her works incorporate fairy and Celtic symbols of happiness, friendship and the sun. Her artistic expression utilizes a range of art techniques: aquarelle, acrylics, clay relief made in the old Japanese raku technique. She fastens her glaze fired objects to a hundred years old or even older boards, beams of old houses, railway sleepers and washed-ashore wood. Through her artistic expression, her works give a new, sometimes hidden meaning and sense. Clay and wood are revived in symbiosis of the two materials that man has been making use of for thousands of years.     Highlights     - Wood and Clay sculptures - Our \"ka\u0161\u010da\" Slovenian heritage "

Sploh ni neobi\u010dajno, da si zvezdnice poleti spremenijo svojo pri\u010desko, vendar pa je nova pri\u010deska Kate Hudson prekosila vse. Igralko so pretekli torek v Los Angelesu fotografirali s popolnoma pobrito glavo.     Ni \u0161e popolnoma jasno, kdaj to\u010dno se je igralka poslovila od svojih znamenitih dolgih blond las, vendar je sprememba vsekakor dramati\u010dna in presenetljiva \u2013 \u0161e posebej zato, ker Hudsonova ni znana po drasti\u010dnih spremembah svoje pri\u010deske.     Igralka trenutno sodeluje pri projektu s pevko Sio in Maddie Ziegler in glede na fotografijo, ki jo je objavila v sredo zjutraj na Instagramu, je o\u010ditno, da je sprememba pri\u010deske povezana prav s tem.     A post shared by Kate Hudson (@katehudson) on Jul 26, 2017 at 8:06am PDT     Hudsonova pa ni prva, ki si je za vlogo pobrila svoje lase. Nedavno se je od svojih dolgih las poslovila tudi Cara Delevingne. Nova pri\u010deska je samo dokaz, da Kate pristoji \u010disto vsaka pri\u010deska \u2013 tudi popolnoma brez las!

In order to do so it lays down certain concrete relationships between ideologies, terminologies and their effect; as in what exactly post colonial means, why it is important to understand the impact of colonisation on culture and thus on one of the most mass consumed medium in India; films. The thesis explores the depths and complexity of the relationship of these two and the other influences that sprout from it for example the intensity of colonisation as a cultural project and its influence on the social reality of the people, artists, thinkers (and in our case specifically filmmakers) , who in turn reflect on this culture through various mediums including films. The thesis examines the western plethora of film theory in order to accentuate the contrast between film and cinema in the west and east and thus the subsequent need to bring forth a new \u2018Eastern Film theory\u2019.

(vir: wikipedija)     Bog (high peat swampland) is a mire that accumulates peat, a deposit of dead plant material\u2014often mosses, and in a majority of cases, sphagnum moss. It is one of the four main types of wetlands. Other names for bogs include mire, quagmire and muskeg; alkaline mires are called fens. They are frequently covered in ericaceous shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat. The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink. Bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acidic and low in nutrients. In some cases, the water is derived entirely from precipitation, in which case they are termed ombrotrophic (rain-fed). Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown colour, which comes from dissolved peat tannins. In general the low fertility and cool climate results in relatively slow plant growth, but decay is even slower owing to the saturated soil. Hence peat accumulates. Large areas of landscape can be covered many metres deep in peat. Bogs have distinctive assemblages of plant and animal species and are of high importance for biodiversity, particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed. (source: wikipedija) "

        "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.

        "text":" Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease which is also referred to as infectious jaundice, as infection with the hepatitis A virus can lead to liver inflammation with symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, fever and the appearance of yellow pigmentation of the skin and conjunctivas. The symptoms occur within 15-50 days of infection. Interestingly, the symptoms and severity of the disease depend upon the age of the infected person. In most adults infected with the virus, the disease causes jaundice, and it is fatal for approximately 2% of persons over the age of 50. In some cases, the disease only lasts for a few weeks, but for a minority, issues related to liver inflammation can persist for up to a year. In contrast to adults, however, the disease mostly manifests itself in a milder form in children, even without jaundice. But while they may not experience problems, they shed the virus in their excrement, thus causing the spread of infection among people in their vicinity; infected persons shed the hepatitis A virus in their excrement up to 10 days before the onset of symptoms, when they themselves are not yet experiencing any medical problems, and for some days after the onset of jaundice. If infected persons do not practice good hygiene, the virus is given a constant source of food, and if sanitary conditions are inadequate, it can even find its way into drinking water. The hepatitis A virus is contracted through direct contact with an infected person and by ingesting contaminated food or water. Raw or inadequately thermally processed mussels, in which viruses are accumulated from the contaminated sewage which flows into the sea, also present a risk of infection.     Hepatitis A occurs throughout the world. The risk of infection in developed countries such as Slovenia is actually very low. There is, however, a medium-high or even very high risk of infection in the countries of Africa, Central and South America, the whole of Asia with the exception of Japan and Singapore, and some countries of Eastern and Southeast Europe. 10 to 20 cases of hepatitis A are recorded in Slovenia per year. But in our immediate surroundings and in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, where Slovenians travel most often, there are as many as several hundred or even several thousand cases of hepatitis A per year, sometimes even in the form of epidemics. One of the largest hepatitis A epidemics occurred at the turn of 2007 in Serbia, predominantly in Ni\u0161 and its surroundings. Serbia recorded a total of almost 5000 cases of the disease in 2007 and 2008.     In less developed parts of the world, most of the population is infected during their childhood or early adulthood. In Slovenia, persons younger than 50 have mostly not come into contact with the virus in their entire lives, making them all the more at risk of infection when travelling to the abovementioned regions of the world, where there is a high risk of infection. In the countries of Western and Central Europe, more than half of all patients are infected while travelling abroad. The risk of infection depends upon the destination and duration of the trip, as well as the living conditions, food and drink safety standards and, of course, the sanitary conditions at the destination. Although the risk of infection can be reduced by practicing good hand hygiene, it is not possible to ensure that the persons who prepare and serve your food during your trip practice proper hygiene and handle the food correctly.     Even tourists who only visit holiday resorts in endemic countries for short periods of time and stay and eat at high-class hotels can develop a serious case of the disease. A good example of this is the hepatitis A epidemic which occurred among the guests of one of the all-inclusive high-class hotels in Hurghada, Egypt, in 2004, when at least 350 persons from 9 European countries became ill; most of them, 271, were from Germany. The cause of the infection was most likely the freshly squeezed orange juice served at breakfast. Regardless of the fact that Egypt is a country with a high risk of hepatitis A infection, most of the German tourists had not been vaccinated against the disease. After returning from Hurghada, an Austrian tourist also caused a local hepatitis A epidemic among the guests of the restaurant at which she worked. Because symptoms of hepatitis only begin to show in infected persons a few weeks after infection, while the virus begins to be shed before the disease develops, the hepatitis A virus was transmitted from the tourist onto 13 guests of the restaurant at which she worked.     Research shows, however, that the risk of infection has been decreasing in the past years for passengers travelling from developed countries to less developed parts of the world. Nonetheless, hepatitis A remains the most common travel-related disease, and it can be protected against by vaccination. Vaccination is actually the only effective way of preventing infection. Hepatitis A vaccine is a so-called dead vaccine and is thus entirely safe. It is also very effective, as it makes virtually all vaccinated persons immune as soon as a month after the first dose of the vaccine. The second dose, which is administered 6 months to a year after the first dose, ensures long-term protection. Current research shows that after the two doses are administered, vaccinated persons develop lifelong immunity, and booster doses are therefore no longer required under current doctrine.     The greatest risk of infection for Slovenian travellers is, of course, travelling to the countries of Africa, Asia and Central and South America, regardless of the duration of the trip and the living conditions. Despite the fact that most people think that taking a short holiday in holiday resorts in Turkey, Egypt, Tunis, Morocco and other popular destinations does not constitute a risk for infection with hepatitis A or other infectious diseases, actual data and research show that this is far from the truth. Considering the fact that Slovenians mostly travel to nearby destinations, it must be noted that there is a risk of hepatitis A infection even when travelling to or visiting friends or relatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia or Kosovo. International travel medicine experts are of the opinion that it is advisable to get vaccinated against hepatitis A before travelling to any of the aforementioned countries of the former Yugoslavia, as well as Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldavia, Ukraine, Belarus or Russia (more at http:\/\/www.drustvo-bpnb.si\/index.php\/english-articles\/202-vaccination-agains-hepatitis-a and http:\/\/www.drustvo-bpnb.si\/index.php\/english-articles\/204-vaccination-against-hepatitis-a-and-hepatitis-b).

Med igro nevede naleti na \u0161olski katalog, v katerem opazi novo \u0161olsko torbo z motivom letala. O\u010deta prepri\u010da, da jo gresta kupit v bli\u017enjo knjigarno. Uresni\u010ditev \u017eelje privede do soo\u010denja z neprijetnim prestopom v novi svet prvega \u0161olskega dne. Nalu se mora odpovedati svojemu otro\u0161tvu ter s tem posledi\u010dno izgubi svoj obraz. \/\/ In a world where adults have no faces and wear masks instead, a naive child spends his childhood dreaming about airplanes. During the play, he unknowingly stumbles upon a school catalogue in which he notices a new school bag with an airplane design. He convinces his father to go and buy it at the nearby bookstore. The realization of his wish consequently leads to the confrontation with an unpleasant transition into a new world on the first day of school. Nalu has to leave his childhood and lose his face.     LUCIDNE SANJE \u2013 priprava magistrskega filma \/\/ LUCID DREAMING \u2013 MA film in progress Johana Ml\u00edchov\u00e1 Mentor: Timon Leder     Izku\u0161nje resni\u010dnih lucidnih sanja\u010dev o njihovih fantasti\u010dnih, izkrivljenih, barvitih in drugih sanjskih potovanjih so lahko navdih za gledalce, da tudi oni v sanjah poskusijo postati lucidni. Poeti\u010den film o izku\u0161njah ljudi z lucidnimi sanjami, brez razlag in obsojanj. Film navdihnjen z intervjuji ljudi z vsega sveta o njihovih najbolj norih lucidnih sanjah, kako jih dojemajo in kako so lucidne sanje spremenile njihov pogled na resni\u010dnost. Glasovi iz intervjujev ponazarjajo fantasti\u010dne podobe, razen zadnjega dela filma, kjer je upodobljen na\u010din izvedbe intervjujev \u2013 sogovorniki nam na animiranem zaslonu prenosnega ra\u010dunalnika govorijo o filozofskem videnju svojih sanj. \/\/ Experiences of real lucid dreamers and their fantastical, distorted, colorful and gravity defying dream world as an inspiration for viewers to try becoming lucid in a dream too. A poetic film about people\u2019s experiences with lucid dreaming without questioning or explaining them. Inspired by interviewes of people from around the world about their craziest lucid dreams, how they perceive them, and how the lucid dreams changed their view of reality, told by metaphors in a non-linear story. The voiceovers from interviews are illustrated by fantastical images, apart from the final part of the film, where the way the interviews were held is portrayed \u2013 the interviewees tell us their more philosophical perspectives from the animated laptop screen.

        "text":" Accommodations     Is situated between two interesting Alpine villages Rate\u010de and Podkoren, not far from the main road. A well marked footpath leads from the car park near main road to the beautiful blue-green small lake - the source of the Sava Dolinka river. The lake then spreads eastward into an extensive marsh. In the past this area has undergone important geological changes . Now it attracts with its rich fauna nad flora. Due to the humid ground, special plants like \u00bbrosika\u00ab , the meat eating plant grow there. Some rare and endangered animal species have preserved there,too. In 1992 the Zelenci area was proclaimed the natural reserve.     Tamar (1108m)     Planica valley extends into the picturesque Alpine Tamar Valley \u2013 starting point for extreme mountaineering in the Julian Alps. It is surrounded by magnificent mountains of Mojstrovka, Ponce and Jalovec (the most beautiful peak in the Julian Alps, the symbol of Slovene alpinists).     Right at the foot of magnificent mountain walls the green oasis with the Mountain Hut Tamar is situated. This place used to be a pasture with the sheperd' s cottage in the place of Present Tamar Hut. Not far from The Hut, in the steep mountain walls of Mt. Ponce takes its source the Nadi\u017ea river which forms a beautuful waterfall but after 100 m sinks underground and springs out again at Zelenci as the Sava Dolinka river.The villlage of Rate\u010de gets its water supply from Nadi\u017ea which is an excellent drinking water. The Chapel of Our Lady Of Good Help was built in 1936 on the iniciative of the then priest in Rate\u010de Josip Lavti\u017ear. In 2002 the Chapel was renovated on the iniciative of the priest Marko Benedik and in accordance with the conception of our renown artist p. Marko Ivan Rupnik. The renovation has reached its climax in marvellous mosaics made by p. Rupnik and the group of his assistant from Centro Aletti in Rome. Church service \u2013 every Sunday in July and August- at 3 pm.     Tromeja - Pe\u010d (1510m) Three Countries Border     The village of Rate\u010de is \u00bbleant\u00ab to the sunny side of Mt. Pe\u010d (1500 m). The Three Countries Meeting Point can be a pleasant walking tour. The woodpath leads from the \u0160urc Inn , past the meadows and then right to The Three Borders Crossing Point from where we can enjoy a wonderful view of the surrounding valleys , villages and mountains. At this very important European crossing of the three Europeans nations and cultures a monument was erected in 1994- dedicated to the understanding and friendship among the three nations.     PEACE IS NOT ONLY THE ABSENCE OF WAR, PEACE IS HARMONY, PEACE IS LOVE, COMPLETION AND TOLERANCE. (Sri Chinmoy)     Mangartska-Belope\u0161ka jezera     Mangart or Bela pe\u010d Lakes , approximately 10 km from Rate\u010de on the Italian side of the border used to belong to Slovenia; only after the World War I the new border separated them from our country. They can be reached either by car following the road as far as Bela Pe\u010d ( Fusine Laghi) and then turning left , or by bike and on foot taking a woodland path heading south through the meadows and woods.. The extensive area is distinguished by its marvellous flora and fauna and by two extraordinary beautiful lakes - the Lower and the Upper one- framed by abrupt mountain walls and with the fourth highest mountain in the Julian Alps, Mangart, rising to the south.     In 1971 the area was proclaimed a natural park. In its centre there is a museum with a fine collection of hand- made tools. Visitors can enjoy in the breathtaking lake view and the view of the mountains. There is a variety of walking routes round the two lakes and from the Lower to the Upper one. And more skilled mountaineers can go up to the top of Mt. Mangart or Ponce. Not far from the Upper Lake , on an open meadow, the herdsman from Rate\u010de tends the flock in summer. "

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

        "text":" Complex Matter F7     The research within the department of Complex Matter encompasses a variety of research fields, ranging from the synthesis of new materials to fundamental investigations of elementary excitations, self-organising behaviour and adaptive functionality in complex systems. These include anything from nano-biosystems and biomolecules to superconductors and nanowires. The experimental methods used are suitably diverse, from synthetic chemistry to biomedicine, femtosecond laser spectroscopy and magnetometry. The experimental research within the department is strongly supported by theory. Recently, the research activities on new nanomaterials and nanotechnology, such as nanolithography were greatly expanded. Apart from fundamental research, some viable applications have also emerged, particularly in the field of new nanomaterials such as MOsix nanowires. The Department is also involved in the Center of Excellence for Nanotehnology     Dynamics of complex systems We investigate relaxation processes in strongly correlated electron systems. The dynamics of photoexcited electrons is studied in several systems, including superconductors, CDW systems, manganites, heavy fermions, MgB2 and systems with electonically driven transitions.     Theory of complex systems The discoveries of novel functional dynamics in new complex materials requires fundamentally new theoretical approaches for reaching an understanding of the underlying physics. The dynamics of charged complex systems with correlated electrons, particularly high-Tc superconductors and related functional materials is investigated using a variety of phenomelogical and numerical methods.     Nanomaterials: MOSIx, nanowires, fullerene magnetism ... The synthesis of novel nanomaterials is mainly focussed on transition metal cluster nanomaterials such as MoSI nanowires. The research includes synthesis, basic characterisation, measurement of physical properties and functionalisation on the nanoscale.     Applications of nanomaterials and nanotechnology MOSI nanowires promise a variety of possible applications, ranging from monomolecular substrates for biomolecular sensors to fillers in advanced composites. Other applications include field emission devices and tribological composites.     Soft matter research Soft matter research includes several different systems, from confined liquid crystals (in planar, cylindrical, spherical geometries or even HPDLCs) and observations of surface effects, to self-assembly of guanosine and investigations of polymeric aligning layers using optical methods.     Biophysics and Biomedical optics Biophysics research at our department includes experimental studies of molecular motors and protein manipulation with optical tweezers and investigation of electron dynamics in DNA using optical spectroscopy. Biomedical optics and engineering involves studies of laser-tissue interaction and development of novel laser-based diagnostic and therapeutic applications.     Nonlinear optics In Nonlinear optics laboratory we study new materials and their interaction with laser light. We are especially interested in new materials which promise new applications in the following highly competitive fields: optical data storage, optical processing and telecommunications, especially in the form of integrated optics. We are also interested in compact laser sources in the eye-safe wavelength region of 1550 nm. We cooperated with a laser company Fotona from Ljubljana and with the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Japan, studying the optical properties of domain engineered LiTaO3 crystals with Mg doping and various degrees of stoichiometry. These crystals are especially suited for optical parametric conversion from the Nd:YAG wavelength to the eye-safe region. "

ABSTRACT: Global media monitoring assumes dealing with large amounts of heterogeneous textual data across many languages in a near real-time. We will present a pipeline of machine learning, text mining, and semantic extraction components representing global social dynamics as an evolving network of interrelated events extracted from media. We will demonstrate the proposed approach on an operational system \"Event Registry (http:\/\/EventRegistry.org) for (a) collecting media information from over 300,000 news and social media sources, (b) performing linguistic and semantic processing in multiple languages, (c) forming cross-lingual events and event sequences, (d) streaming information about even ts in open data formats, (e) rich visualizations, and (f) complex queries to analyse global social dynamics. Challenges and technical solutions will be discussed. "

INDIVIDUALNO SVETOVANJE     Za uporabnike 1KA nudimo individualno svetovanje na podro\u010djih     ONLINE SERVICE     1KA service can be used free of charge at 1KA.si domain. Only registration is required (new users) or login (registered users).     Frequently Asked Questions - GDPR     1. How is server security in 1KA offline installation regulated?     1KA is an application that requires a server to operate. When installing 1KA on PCs (1KA offline), 1KA uses one of the free servers (UWAMP), which is a well-known and very well-documented application.     The 1KA installation is also well tested on this server, but problems may arise solely from additional security configurations that the user may have. This should then be addressed further (maybe in collaboration with the 1KA Help Centre). If users have some very advanced or specific security configurations and requirements, instead of UWAMP, we recommend installing a classic 1KA, where the user must, of course, take care of the entire server layout and configuration.     More information about the UWAMP server: www.uwamp.com\/en\/     Before using the 1KA application (general or any other installation), read the general terms of use of the tool: https:\/\/www.1ka.si\/d\/en\/about\/terms-of-use\/general-terms.     2. How does the 1KA tool regulate compliance with GDPR laws and internal acts?     1KA installations installed on the servers of the University of Ljubljana are properly taken care of. More information on technical and other measures for survey editors is available here https:\/\/www.1ka.si\/d\/en\/gdpr.     Advanced users can optionally sign a more or less customized data processing agreement (DPA) if they wish. The DPA is available in the 'My Surveys' directory, where all users have the 'GDPR' tab available, with a PDF version (LINK).     Of course, for your own installations, any additional server adjustments must be made by the user.     3. Does 1KA enable audit trail traceability?     The 1KA application allows complete traceability of all interventions in the 1KA application itself (e.g. who and when viewed the data, who and when modified it in the questionnaire or in the data, etc.). All of its installations also track the traceability of server-side interventions using the Linux Audit Daemon system installed on the server. It is configured to record, inter alia:     any user login and elevation of user privileges on the system;     any programs and terminal commands of any user (including system users such as web, cron, etc);     access to (read, write) all subfolders on the file system by installing 1KA (1KA web root);     accessing (reading, writing) files on file systems containing databases;     in combination with audit daemon, all SQL queries are logged in SQL log files.     Log data is securely and encrypted additively transmitted to a secondary server in another location (VPN, rSync via SSH) - deleting server files or their contents is not transmitted to another server.     The log files on the primary server are deleted daily, and on the secondary server, they are packaged daily in encrypted archives and kept for 30 days for security purposes.     4. Audit trail on your own installations and offline 1KA     In its own installations, traceability is the responsibility of the installer. In principle (and more theoretically, but practically this is very difficult), log-based changes can be made to track all changes and interventions in a specific 1KA survey, even if it was deleted in 1KA. However, a special \"audit daemon\" for server interventions is not installed on off-line 1KA and should be edited by the user if desired. You should know that the entire off-line installation of 1KA is only temporary, since after the survey is completed the data is exported and therefore it is the responsibility of the user to remove the entire installation afterwards, thus removing all traces.     The above applies to server-level audit trail (access to MySQL database, access to the server, etc.), depending on the server or the computer on which the application is located and not from the application itself. This must be provided by the user of his own installation or offline 1KA.     The audit trail at the application level itself (questionnaire changes, viewing and changing answers) is part of the application and works the same with offline versions.     5. Description of personal data processing within 1KA     Personal Data Controller - Registered users of the application who create and perform the online survey. As users process data on their own behalf, they are the controllers of personal data.     Organization - an FSD organization that acts as a contractor in relation to its managers. This allows managers to use 1ka and store information on servers.     Respondent - Individuals who solve a survey prepared and produced by a personal data controller.     The user of the web application can be anyone who registers on the site and accepts the general terms of use for the purpose of creating an online survey. The user is, according to the GDPR, a data controller who processes the data in the course of conducting an online survey for his or her own purposes. Anyone invited by the user to participate in the survey can answer the survey.     In his user profile, each manager has access to data from solved surveys that he has created through his profile. This information may also be accessed by any other registered user to whom the operator grants the rights. The user accounts are stored permanently on a server in Slovenia, along with the controller\u2019s surveys.     The organization acts as a contracted processor and does not use data collected through 1KA for its own purposes. For controllers, the organization stores data on third-party servers and provides them with a tool for conducting surveys.     6. Who are the contracted processors of 1KA?     Data from application 1KA is stored on the server of the contracted processor of the organization (Telemach d.o.o.) in Slovenia.     The 1KA user agrees that the 1KA service may contract with the hosting subcontractors and other subcontractors that support the functionality of the 1KA service.     The relevant contract (between 1KA and the sub-processor) and the associated GDPR attachment may be annexed to the 1KA user at the explicit request.     7. How long are backups stored for?     Daily backups of system events (log-ins) are saved.     Log data is securely and encrypted additively transmitted to a secondary server in another location (VPN, rSync via SSH) - deleting server files or their contents is not transmitted to another server.     The log files on the primary server are deleted daily, and on the secondary server, they are packaged daily in encrypted archives and kept for 30 days for security purposes. Monthly backups are stored at the DRC location for 6 months.     8. How is the process of deleting personal data from a backup performed? How are changes in the backups recorded?     Within the backup system, the system administrator opens the file to locate the appropriate respondent whose personal data is deleted. The file is modified and packed back to the archive as requested. Care must be taken not to damage the integrity of the backup.     In the case of an individual's request for the deletion of personal or survey data, in principle, the deletion shall be carried out only in the primary source. A log is kept for backups for any subsequent procedures into backups. It records who and when interfered with the backup.     Backup deletions are, in principle, only possible if a specific backup is restored. The responsible person in charge of a particular survey must, therefore, re-erase the restored backup copy. "

        "text":" The Computer Museum's collection of old hardware and software has grown since 2004. It kicked off in the now defunct Cyberpipe multimedia centre where the exhibited configurations were also interactive. By then the donations helped build a remarkable collection of over 300 computer hardware and software items, computer magazines, manuals etc. A non-profit association was established in 2013 in order to open the Computer Museum as a permanent venue with its own educational and participatory programmes, focused on challenges of the information society's fast changes.     Contents     Exhibitions     The museum has not opened yet but occasionally the temporary education activities and exhibitions are prepared. The most popular so far was Goto 1982 (2012), hosted by the National Museum of Contemporary History and seen by 12,000 visitors, later shown also in the Technical Museum of Slovenia (2013).     The Battle for Slovenian exhibition at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana featured milestones in translation of software in Slovenian language, care for its digital infrastructure, and development of new terminology as well as its related slang (2019).     The museum offers also a set-up of a satellite collection, a temporary display, hosted by a supporting partner. The first one is situated at the Zemanta headquarters, a company closely linked to the museum founders.     Background     The collection grew out of the Cyberpipe activities. This multimedia centre, focused on open source and other free technologies was established in 2000. It was managed by the K6\/4 Institute up to 2013 when the association, established by the museum's founders took over the museum collection. Two years later Cyberpipe dissolved.     Cyberpipe housed the first computer museum in Slovenia and organised many events or projects dealing with computer history. The museum was interactive so that visitors could use Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari 1040ST, Macintosh SE, IBM PS\/1, IBM PC XT, etc.     Has subobject\"Has subobject\" is a predefined property representing a container construct and is provided by Semantic MediaWiki.

        "text":" Background: The popularity of integrating quantitative and qualitative methodologies in the same research has grown incredibly in recent years. There is a lack of evidence about the efficiency of mixed methods use in health sciences research practice. The purpose of this study was to analyse the areas, main research themes, mixed methods research design typologies and efficiency of implementation and further open questions regarding mixed methods in health sciences. Methods: A systematic review was made on a sample of 25 scientific articles of health sciences that stated mixed methods use in research. Inclusion criteria: original scientific article with applying and evaluating of mixed methods, published during the period July 2006 - July 2011 in a peer reviewed journal, included in international databases: WebSurveyMethodology, CINAHL, MEDLINE and PubMed. Results: All 25 studies provided effectiveness of mixed methods use in health science research practice. Mixed methods are the most popular in nursing (32%) and health promotion (28%). Sequential mixed methods research design is prevalent (64.3%), with the first research phase in priority (71.4%). The relation between quantitative (57.2%) and qualitative (42.8%) priority approach is balanced. Complementarity (57.1%), triangulation (28.6%) and expansion (14.3%) are the most common research purposes for using mixed methods in health sciences. Conclusions: The presented findings confirmed mixed methods applicability for the complex and less studied research problems in health sciences. Conceptualisation of mixed methods in different disciplines of health sciences, development of quality criteria and standards for mixed methods research assessment and expansion of mixed methods in clinical practice as support in evidence based practice development appeared as the most important research questions of mixed methods in health sciences that should be addressed in the future studies.

Secondary language     Language:     English     Title:     Integrating quantitative and qualitative methodology in health science research     Abstract:     Izhodi\u0161\u010da: Priljubljenost integracije kvantitativne in kvalitativne metodologije v isti raziskavi je neverjetno narasla v zadnjih letih. Nimamo pa veliko podatkov o uspe\u0161nosti njihove uporabe v raziskovalni praksi na podro\u010dju zdravstva. Namen te raziskave je bil analizirati podro\u010dja, osrednje raziskovalne tematike, vrste raziskovalnih na\u010drtov, uspe\u0161nost uporabe in nadaljnja odprta vpra\u0161anja integracije metod v raziskavah v zdravstvu. Metode: Raziskava temelji na sistemati\u010dni pregledni \u0161tudiji 25 znanstvenih \u010dlankov s podro\u010dja zdravstva, ki so pri svojem raziskovanju uporabili integracijo metod. Vklju\u010ditvena merila: izvirni znanstveni \u010dlanek z uporabo in evalvacijo integracije metod, objavljen v obdobju julij 2006-julij 2011 v reviji z recenzijo, ki je vklju\u010dena v mednarodne baze podatkov: WebSurvey Methodology, CINAHL, MEDLINE in PubMed. Rezultati: Vseh 25 analiziranih raziskav je potrdilo uspe\u0161nost uporabe integracije metod v raziskavah v zdravstvu. Uporaba integracije metod je najpogostej\u0161a na podro\u010dju zdravstvene nege (32%) in promocije zdravja (28%). Prevladuje zaporedni na\u010din izvedbe kvantitativne in kvalitativne faze raziskave (64,3%), pri \u010demer je prva faza v ve\u010dini primerov dominantna (71,4%). Razmerje med kvantitativnim (57,2%) in kvalitativnim (42,8%) prioritetnim pristopom je uravnote\u017eeno. Najpogosteje uporabljeni nameni integracije metod v raziskavah v zdravstvu so komplementarnost (57,1%), triangulacija (28,6%) in ekspanzija (14,3%). Zaklju\u010dki: Dobljene ugotovitve potrjujejo uporabnost integracije metod pri raziskovanju kompleksnih in manj raziskanih problematik v zdravstvu ter izkazujejo potrebe po nadaljnjih raziskovanjih, kot so: konceptualizacija integracije metod v posameznih disciplinah zdravstvenih ved, razvoj meril in standardov ocenjevanja kakovosti raziskav z integracijo metod ter raz\u0161iritev uvedbe integracije metod v klini\u010dno prakso kot podpore pri razvoju na dokazih podprte prakse.

Cenik SIST     This part of IEC 61400 specifies requirements to ensure the engineering integrity of wind turbine blades as well as an appropriate level of operational safety throughout the design lifetime. It includes requirements for: \u2022 aerodynamic and structural design, \u2022 material selection, evaluation and testing, \u2022 manufacture (including associated quality management), \u2022 transportation, installation, operation and maintenance of the blades. The purpose of this document is to provide a technical reference for designers, manufacturers, purchasers, operators, third party organizations and material suppliers, as well as to define requirements for certification. With respect to certification, this document provides the detailed basis for fulfilling the current requirements of the IECRE system, as well as other IEC standards relevant to wind turbine blades. When used for certification, the applicability of each portion of this document should be determined based on the extent of certification, and associated certification modules per the IECRE system. The rotor blade is defined as all components integrated in the blade design, excluding removable bolts in the blade root connection and support structures for installation. This document is intended to be applied to rotor blades for all wind turbines. For rotor blades used on small wind turbines according to IEC 61400-2, the requirements in that document are applicable. At the time this document was written, most blades were produced for horizontal axis wind turbines. The blades were mostly made of fiber reinforced plastics. However, most principles given in this document would be applicable to any rotor blade configuration, size and material.

In\u0161titut je imel naslednje naloge: znanstveno prou\u010devanje tehnolo\u0161kih, organizacijskih in ekonomskih problemov, pomembnih za razvoj tekstilne industrije,     standardizacija in izbolj\u0161ave, uvajanje novih tehnolo\u0161kih postopkov v tekstilno industrijo, dajanje strokovnih nasvetov tekstilnim podjetjem, izdelovanje novih projektov in preizku\u0161anje materiala za tekstilno stroko.     Kasneje je delovanje Tekstilnega in\u0161tituta postalo multidisciplinarno, saj je posegalo na podro\u010dja, ki s tekstilom niso bila povezana, vendar pa so predstavljala njegove razvojne mo\u017enosti (npr. tehni\u010dni tekstil, farmacevtski, kozmeti\u010dni in kemi\u010dni izdelki, strojegradnja ipd.). 27. 12. 2006 je Vlada RS na dopisni seji sprejela sklep, da se Tekstilni in\u0161titut Maribor zaradi nelikvidnosti priklju\u010di k javnemu zavodu In\u0161titut informacijskih znanosti.     Vir: Pokrajinski arhiv Maribor     Textile schools and Textile Institute Maribor     After World War II, textile schools developed in Maribor. The first industrial textile school was established in 1947. During its first year, 109 students from all republics of the former Yugoslavia were enrolled in the school. For two years, the school operated in the scope of the Maribor Textile Factory until it became an independent educational institution in school year 1949\/50.     The school was located on the Ulica kraljevi\u010da Marka Street, where the Textile Institute later developed. The school was closed in school year 1951\/52. In 1958, the Maribor Textile Factory and other textile factories established a new Industrial Textile School, which was renamed Technical Textile School in 1960. Later, the school was closed and the Technical Electro and Mechanical Engineering School Maribor received a textile section. In 1981, the Secondary Textile School was established, today known as the Secondary School for Design.     The Textile Institute Maribor was established with the decision of the Executive Council of the People\u2019s Assembly of the People\u2019s Republic of Slovenia in 1953. The institute had the following tasks: scientific study of technological, organisational and economic problems, important for the development of textile industry; standardisation and improvement, deployment of new technological procedures in the textile industry; professional counselling for textile companies; preparation of new projects and testing materials for the textile industry.     The Textile Institute soon became a multidisciplinary institution and operated in fields, that were not directly connected to textile, but represented developmental opportunities for the industry (e.g. technical textile, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and chemical products, machine manufacture, etc.). On December 27th 2006, the government of the Republic of Slovenia decided to affiliate the Textile Institute Maribor to the Institute of Information Science due to illiquidity. "

Abstract: Teachers\u2019 work engagement determines the quality of their teaching and classroom behavior. Understanding the factors that contribute to a high level of teacher engagement is thus crucial to promoting quality educational work. The existing research shows that the perceived characteristics of the working environment are an important factor of work engagement in teachers. At the same time, an important characteristic of teachers\u2019 work is the need for emotional labor; the latter can represent either a job demand or a job resource. Based on the job demands-resources model, the purpose of the present research was to examine perceived job demands (workload) and job resources (autonomy, coworker and supervisor support) as factors of teachers\u2019 work engagement on a sample of 344 teachers from 22 Slovenian elementary schools. In addition, we aimed to examine the potential of emotional labor strategies as either a risk factor or a protective factor for teachers\u2019 work engagement. The results indicated that perceived autonomy positively predicted teachers\u2019 work engagement and that emotional labor had the potential to represent both a job demand and a job resource. Surface acting was found to negatively predict work engagement, whereas deep acting was a positive predictor of work engagement. Based on our findings, we propose some measures to increase teachers\u2019 work engagement.

        "text":" Povzetek: In recent decades, the conservation of biodiversity has become one of the main areas under consideration in managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Forest management practices are primary drivers of diversity and may enhance or decrease forest biodiversity, according to the measures applied (thinning options). We have focused on three beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests across a latitudinal gradient in Italy, characterised by different structures resulting from dissimilar management. We tested the short-term effects of differently-based silvicultural intervention vs. stands where no silvicultural practices were applied on biodiversity indicators and related proxies: deadwood amounts, microhabitat density, floristic richness and life form abundance. In each study area, the occurrence of the above indicators and proxies was evaluated before and after the implementation of crop tree thinning (CTT) and thinning from below (LT) methods, comparing them with control areas where no interventions were performed. After two years, the management options resulted in different responses of the investigated parameters. The CTT increased deadwood amounts in comparison with the LT ones, while stumps increased significantly after the LT thinning. Microhabitats increased significantly where intervention was not undertaken. On the contrary, they remained unaltered after the LT treatments. CTT thinning created favourable conditions for the development of microhabitats and their proliferation in the long term. Two years after the application of the CTT thinning treatment, all forest stands demonstrated a significant increase in their floristic richness and herb layer cover. Significant differences were also found in both the frequency and cover of life forms in relation to silvicultural treatment. These findings provide a better understanding of short-term effects of silvicultural treatment useful for maintaining biodiversity in mountain beech forests.

Deadline for submission of final paper: 9 July 2007     The organiser will publish only the papers submitted by authors, who will settle their registration fee by 15 July 2007.     Instructions for speakers     Tips and suggestions for presentations. Presentation time for oral presentations in regular, special and student sessions is 15 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions. The main goal of your oral presentation is to get the audience interested in your work. All presentations are to be made in English. Speak slowly, use short sentences. An effective oral presentation should be structured accordingly: outline of main points (one slide at the beginning in the form of a table of contents\/agenda ), introduction (arouse your audience's interest, demonstrate why the topic is important), details of main points (follow the order of your outline, limit the number of points you make, since listeners cannot process as much information as readers can, be clear when you are switching to a new point, since listeners cannot follow as easily as readers can), conclusion (a summary of your main points). General suggestions for slides: use max. 1-2 slides per minute of your presentation, and 4-5 points per slide, use clear titles, use graphs and figures rather than just words, use large fonts (18-24), show only the slides that you are discussing (do not skip slides during presentation).     Equipment. DATA projectors (beamer) for computer presentation (resolution up to 1024 x 768 pixels), notebook with Windows XP operating system, PowerPoint, Adobe Acrobat. Presenters are kindly asked to use the available computers. Only if they have special reasons should they use their own notebooks. Slide and overhead projectors will not be available.     Installation of presentation. Only Power Point or PDF presentations on a CD-ROM or a USB Memory stick will be accepted. Authors are invited to upload and check their presentation in the INTERNET\/PRVIEW room (entrance from the Foyer hall) if possible one day before the presentation. Alternatively, the presentation can be uploaded directly to the presenting computer by a session technician before the session (please come at least 15 minutes before the start of the session).     Instructions for posters     Posters must be brought to the congress by the presenting author. The dimensions should not exceed 90 cm (width) and 100 cm (height). At the top of the poster, please provide the title of the paper, the names of the authors and their affiliations, all in bold lettering of about 2 to 3 cm size. Artwork and lettering should be large and clear enough so that the poster is readable from a distance of 1.5 m.     Posters will be presented in the Foyer hall of the congress site. Each poster is numbered and the appropriate numbers will appear on the poster stands. Presenters are responsible for posting and removing the materials. Posters have to be displayed from Wednesday morning until the end of the congress. Authors of posters can be available at the site during coffee breaks, but they are also requested to be there at the time scheduled for the poster session. "

It is divided into two parts (3a and 3b), each of which is made up of a course book, a workbook and two DVDs with audio and video. The material comprises 10 units that are coordinated with the programme Sloven\u0161\u010dina za tujce and the guidelines specified for this level by the Common European Framework of Reference. Thus in part a, the first two units deal with everyday communication situations, while the following three units offer information about Slovene culture and history, as well as socio-political life in Slovenia and outside it. The units in part b deal with social issues, the media, topical themes in science and the language used in business texts. The final, tenth unit, is aimed at repetition and summarises the themes that have been dealt with. It encourages students to reflect on their language abilities and then presents a series of activities with which they can check how much they have learnt. At the end of both partsthere is also a short orthography. Both course books are further supplemented by a workbook, which contains exercises for reinforcement of the vocabulary, and grammatical and communicational patterns.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

The possible prognostic value of tissue markers, such as p53, may give a better understanding of this disease, improve staging accuracy, and help in choosing optimal treatment. In this study, we examined p53 expression and its correlation with Gleason score, prostate\u2013specific antigen (PSA) levels, and patient age in a Slovenian population.     Methods: This retrospective pilot study included 25 radical prostatectomy patients. The immunohistochemical expression of p53 was determined and expressed as a p53 index. In addition, correlations between p53 index, Gleason score before and after prostatectomy, PSA level, and patient age were statistically evaluated.     Results: The p53 tissue marker was unevenly distributed in prostate cancer independently of local Gleason pattern; however, its expression correlated with Gleason score after prostatectomy and showed borderline correlation with PSA. There were also statistically significant correlations between Gleason score before and after prostatectomy, PSA level, and patient age.     Conclusions: Despite the low number of cases presented in this study, our results demonstrate that p53 may have predictive value in prostate cancer. Thus, p53 is a promising tissue marker that can be used as an additional diagnostic parameter. "

Awards are granted on national and international level. Among the national winners for 2020 is LIFE CEPLAFIB project, coordinated by Slovenian research centre TECOS.     For the development of innovative and sophisticated recycling technologies on transforming the two post-consumer waste streams: plastic and newsprint paper, into new products applicable to packaging, automotive and construction sectors, TECOS received the prestigious National Energy Globe Award for Slovenia. The innovation potential of CEPLAFIB partnership arises from the novel circular economy approach of the recycling value chain that unites two diverse waste flows into new recycled composites that are sustainable and cost competitive. LIFE CEPLAFIB demonstrates how to combine the low value plastic waste with recovered fibres derived from newsprint paper waste with near to zero waste leftovers and how to transform them into high value-added products used in mass application sectors such as the automotive, caravanning, packaging and construction industries.     The project started in July 2018 and will be finished in June 2020. It is implemented by the Slovenian Tool and Die Development Centre \u2013 TECOS, in cooperation with the Slovenian company for recycling and processing of plastic granulates - OMAPLAST d.o.o. and ADRIA Mobil from Novo mesto, one of the leading European manufacturers of caravans, motorhomes and mobile homes. In addition to Slovenian participants, three international partners are additionally involved in the project, namely the Finnish waste paper recycling company - ECOPULP, the Polish National Building Research Institute - ITB and the development centre involved in plastic processing technologies - AITIIP from Spain.     With more than 182 participating countries and over 2000 project submissions annually the Energy Globe Award is today\u2019s most prestigious environmental prize worldwide. It distinguishes projects nationally and globally that conserve resources such as energy or utilize renewable or emission-free sources. By awarding prizes, they want to enhance the global attention to sustainable environmental solutions that can be used everywhere \u2013 and motivate people to become active in this field as well. "

Export demand has remained the engine of growth. Trade balance, influenced by jump of exports to EU, was in September positive. The state in the trade balance is approaching the exceptional situation in 1992; the reasons differ.     Economic climate cooled slightly in October, which was a product of lowered confidence in manufacturing and construction. Manufacturing orders are similar to orders in the EU, while new orders in the remaining construction sector have been in Slovenia since midyear better than in the EU. Optimism in the service sector, however staying at extremely low level, strengthened somewhat, the confidence in the retail trade increased as well, despite problems with weak demand.     September\u2019s industrial production was higher than in the same month year ago, but the trend (impulse trend) turned down. The value of construction works in September increased while it decreased in the year to year change. The number of tourist overnights increased slightly. Foreign tourists contributed the lion\u2019s share.     Employment in a year declined, relatively more of those employed with small employers than of those employed by legal entities, while the number of self-employed increased slightly. The rise in the number of job seekers is mainly seasonal; the first-time jobseekers dominated among those entering job market, while most of those departing the unemployment offices re-employed or became self-employed. The unemployment rate in EU remained high, with the situation in the euro area being considerably worse than in EU states outside euro area. Austria and Germany remain the best, Spain and Greece the worst.     Prices continue to decline, expectations suggest that the decline will end. Cheaper oil products, seasonal fall in prices of fruits and lower prices of telephone and internet services contributed most to the decline in November. Price expectations have not changed for several months; expectations for prices of commodities remained slightly above while prices for services well below long-term average. Producer prices in October fell for products for the domestic and euro market, they increased for markets outside EU; producer prices continue to be pressed by weak demand. Expected producer prices are slightly below the long-term average. Raw material prices increased in the last month, particularly food prices, while prices of gold and oil decreased. Despite current increases, raw material prices remain well below the last year average.     Employee remunerations continued to fall with exceptions in financial and insurance activities, and in education. In a year, remunerations rose the most in manufacturing, they fell in all sectors of the general government, most in the health and social care sectors. Total labor costs do not shrink only due to falling wages but also because of the contraction in employment. Expenditures for employees in Slovenia were since the beginning of the crisis reduced much more than in the euro area, the bulk of the gap was created after the start of a ZUJF. Despite common beliefs, remunerations to the employees in state administration, education and health in Slovenia as a proportion of remuneration of all employees is significantly lower than the euro area average and much lower than in the euro area countries, which received \u201cassistance\u201d. The relatively low expenditure in Slovenia for employees in these three sectors is even more surprising because these activities are in Slovenia almost entirely in public sector, while in the euro area almost a quarter of them is outside public sector. In the countries, which hosted troika, the share of personnel expenses in the administration, education and health remained higher than it was at the beginning of the crisis; by the decline of GDP, caused by austerity measures, private sector was affected more than public sector.     Taxable income continues to strengthen, government revenues increased in October, a more long-term dynamics recovered; annual rate fell due to last year high transfer of tax payments from September to October.     Sluggish slowdown in the fall of loans and deposits continues, current dynamics of loans is slowly improving. Worsening of the current dynamics of deposits has slowed as well. The dynamics of deposits remains fairly robust despite mistakes of economic policy and a multitude of bad news (truths, half-truths and lies) that are day bombing the population. Interbank interest rates remain unchanged; lending rates in September increased for consumer loans and loans to companies for large credits, others did not. In deposit rates, on the deposit side interest rates on deposits with shorter maturities rose, for deposits with longer maturities shrank.     Current account surplus continues to grow which is a classic belt-tightening policy outcome. The surplus was mainly due to a surplus in merchandise trade (which is traditionally in deficit), larger surplus in services, and smaller deficit on the income account. On the current transfers account, net outflow was higher than last year. Financial account adequately reflected current account, obligations decreased much more than last year, partly through the outflow of direct investment. Gross external debt by the end of August fell to 40 billion \u20ac, net external debt decreased as well.     Full article is available in Slovenian language.

And Beyond. \u2013 a new project by Davorin Marc is one of the numerous experiments with short-film format, characteristic for this filmmaker and artist all through his career since 1970s. He frequently cuts into the materiality of film reel and surprises with creative editing, producing a dynamic interplay of image and sound.     The selected nine films from the first period (1976\u20131987) were pulled Out of the Closet and will be shown on TV set. The eight films from the second period (after 2012) will be projected on the wall And Beyond.     The public will be led to the Project Room SCCA passing A Little Here. \u2013 a magic animation in the drawer \u2013 and guided to the window installation And a Little There. \u2013 where the light of the day and night meet.     Davorin Marc, Last few frames, 2013\/2014     Davorin Marc was born Izola in 1964. He has devoted his life to art, especially film, in his very early years. His first film dates in 1976 and until today he has made more than 150 short films, witty diaries and documents of times and situations. He was also active in comics, collages, fanzines and produced a number of installations and exhibitions in the 1980s. He dared to negate the main principles of film directing and editing, introducing a film as an interactive happening. After a long break in his career he is now back on track with a great courage, focusing on digital film and producing \u201cdigital pictures\u201d. Some of his films have been preserved\/restored by the Slovenian Cinematheque, Ljubljana and widely shown on several festivals, exhibitions and personal screenings, e. g. Alternative Film\/Video festival, Belgrade; Kino otok (Isolacinema), Izola; All That is Film!, Experimental Film in Yugoslavia 1951-1991 in Moderna galerija Ljubljana; Anthology Film Archives in New York; Cinematheque Quebecoise, Montreal; Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley; Northwest Film Forum, Seattle; K3 Film Festival Udine | FRAME, Cinema Centrale Udine; Eks Voto (a tama for Ektachrome), The island of Tinos, Greece; International Experimental Film & Video Festival VIDEOEX 2013, Zurich. On the occasion of screening program at the University of Rochester, his masterpieces were shown (e.g. Bite Me. Once Already \/ Ugrizni me. \u017de Enkrat (1978\/80), Slaughter Ahoy \/ Ej Klanje (1981), Fear in the City (1181 Days Later or Smell of Rats) \/ Paura in Citta (1181 Dni Pozneje Ali Vonj Po Podganah) (1984)) and introduced by Jurij Meden, Curator of Film Exhibitions at the George Eastman House: The post-punk Davorin Marc remains very much a subject for further research. Notoriously reclusive and with over 150 Super-8mm and 16mm films under his belt, he modestly describes his work as \u201csmall films,\u201d period, pushing the notion of understatement to a radical, bleeding new extreme.

        "text":" Negotiating Institutions - TATE Liverpool     The utopian dream of a society free from the constraints of institutions is over, as much as it is the imagination of a well-ordered community regulated by the benevolent plans of the welfare state. The current claims for democracy are claims for social responsibility, both individual and collective, which demand a radical redefinition of institutions in the management and defense of the common good. This task cannot be undertaken by means of self-referential institutional critique. Nor can it be undertaken by the autonomous operations of social movements working alone. It must involve a process of negotiation, both open and plural, for which a new space and new protocols have yet to be defined. The meetingNegotiating Institutions aims at debating the conditions of such a negotiation by joining together cultural institutions and groups from different parts of Europe which are already participating in L?Internationale collaborative programs in their specific contexts. Conceived within the terms of the project The Uses of Art, and bringing together representatives from L'Internationale, Liverpool John Moores University and Tate Liverpool, this first meeting intends to catalyze a discussion process which should operate both locally and internationally. With Janna Graham as facilitator and animator of the encounter,Negotiating Institutions hope to be the first of a series of such debates which will lead to the collaborative development and publication of an operational 'Blueprint for Change' amongst L'Internationale members and Associate Partners collaborating on The Uses of Artproject.     Participant Groups:     Di\u00e1sporas cr\u00edticas PEI - MACBA Di\u00e1sporas cr\u00edticas is an artistic research platform related to the PEI (Independent Studies Program) at MACBA. It works within and out of the borders of the museum aiming at building a solidarity network among activists, artists, cultural agents and neighbors of the Raval area in Barcelona. It is conceived as a resistance space against sexual and racial control policies. Its projects intend to understand and develop fundamental ideas of decolonial theory and practice, as well as its current critical diasporas. It also aims at defining the key elements of contemporary coloniality processes underlying in eurocentrism, sexualization, radicalization and exclusi\u00f3n.     Family collective and Tate Collective from Tate Liverpool: The Family Collective and Tate Collective are two groups that work inside Tate Liverpool to give news approaches in the production and reception of art. The Family Collective, key experiment in the spirit of the 'Learning Machine' of museum, is formed by a group of parents that, autonomously, runs their own activities and learning program for families and children in Tate Liverpool's family room with the aim to open new ways to get in touch the children with art. On the other hand, Tate Collective is a group formed by young people who are given space and a budget to programme in Tate's gallery increasing the influence of young people and their work in the museum.     Meet me@MHKA Meet me@MHKA is a programme of the Museum M HKA, developed in collaboration with the University of Antwerp and inspired by the successful Meet Me at MoMA, which organizes tours for people with early dementia and their caregivers. The aim of this programme is to create opportunities for people with early dementia to engage socially and express themselves as a group, and to improve, in this way, their quality of life, as well as counter feelings of depression and isolation. The purpose of their interactive tours is to strengthen the level of emotional communication in the relationship between the patient and the caregiver, look at art together to encourage self-awareness and self-expression in the patient.     Neteorit - Moderna galerija (MG+MSUM) Neteorit is an independent programme of lectures, talks, and debates related to art, theory, and politics, which take place in the basement of the Moderna galerija \/ Museum of Modern Art (MG+). It is run by various collectives and individuals (artists, students, activists) who organize it according to their interests and needs. Most events are open to the public and admission to them is free. The programme is financially self-supportive, with the museum providing the space and some facilities free of charge. Some members of the Neteorit programme collaborate also in other segments of the MG+MSUM organisation, e.g., run the Depo bookstore and related activities at the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova (+MSUM).     Somateca - Museo Reina Sof\u00eda Somateca research group is a heterogenous network of artists, feminist and queer activists and researchers, who were originally engaged in the Critical Practices Studies Program of the Museum with the same title, under the direction of Beatriz Preciado. After the two issues of the studies program, former participants decided to continue their research autonomously, and proposed a relationship with the institution of a new kind. In the last year, different dynamics of collective decision making and negotiation with the institution have been rehearsed. Difficulties and misunderstandings have been frequent, both within the groups and in their dealings with the museum. The learning process is not only about the \"what\" but about the \"how\", since Somateca members and museum managers need to design together a common ground which gives space to autonomy and institutional responsibility.     Van Abbemuseum after Museum of Arte \u00datil: The Van Abbemuseum is a museum of contemporary art in Eindhoven that works, at present, in different approaches about how we can mediate between user-generated and museum-generated content. After the exhibition \"Museum of Arte Util\" (December 2013 to march 2014), in which all kinds of different groups from Eindhoven society were invited to take over the museum, use it, make their own programmes or produce their own products or content serves, the Van Abbemuseum intends to keep the discussion about the question how far an institution can go in terms of visitor participation beyond a concrete experience, how establish a radical change through art practice in a sustainable long-term manner and not simply for the duration of the event.     Conceptual coordinator and moderator: Janna Graham is a writer, organizer, educator and curator. Working with the collectives Ultra-red and Micropolitics Research Group, she participates in ongoing militant research projects on the conditions of cultural workers in London and pedagogies of anti-racism in England's rural areas. She has developed education and curatorial initiatives at institutions including the Art Gallery of Ontario (Toronto), Project Art Centre (Dublin), Vanabbemuseum (Eindhoven) and Plymouth Arts Centre (UK). Janna is currently Projects Curator at Serpentine Gallery where she and colleagues have initiated The Centre for Possible Studies, an off-site popular research centre and and artist residency programme where artists, thinkers and local people develop 'possible studies' in relation to the Edgware Road neighbourhood of London. She is a Phd candidate in Curatorial Knowledge programme at Goldsmiths University, working on a project titled: Thinking with Conditions, which investigates the cross sections between contemporary art, radical education and institutional analysis.     Elliot Perkins: Sound artist and researcher member of Ultra-red collective. In 2002, Perkins received support from the Arts Council's International Artists Fellowships Programme for his collaboration with Shahidul Alam, founder of the media activist organisation DRIK. Combining Perkins's sound work with Alam's photography, EURODAC EXPRESS investigated the experience of migrants making their way from Bangladesh to England. Perkins first collaborated with Ultra-red in 2005 on BLOK 70 and is presently a member of the Ultra-red project RURAL INTAVENSHAN based in Torbay where Perkins is a field organiser for the Rural Racism Project.

Within the project, we will develop flexible approaches to learning that will be tested in the 7 participating countries.     OBJECTIVES     Development, pilot testing and evaluation of a concept for professional development of expert associates, which consists of three parts \u2013 manual for independent study, six modules for implementation of trainings and a roadmap for stakeholders.     Adaptation of the professional development concepts for transfer and use in the partner countries.     Dissemination of the new concept on the national and European level.     DESCRIPTION     In Europe, work-based training that combines vocational training with learning and acquisition of basic skills has become an innovative method for reaching less educated and low-skilled employees and improving their development of basic skills.     Read more     Various national and European projects and implemented strategies based on the innovative training concept use practice-based findings to emulate different ways to approach companies and employees, to learn and develop skills and competences at work and to describe organisational structures that encourage development in this area. It has been shown that for successful implementation of strategies for further education of less educated and low-skilled employed workers at work, the work-based training programmes must be professionally designed. In the scope of the PROFI TRAIN project, we will develop products for testing and evaluation of concepts for training and professional development of human resources.     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS     A Self-study Manual for work-based development of skills;     Six curricularly edited thematic training modules for direct implementation of seminars; and     Read more     European roadmap for stakeholders on the importance and methods of work-based training of basic skills for employees;     Project report and a professional article describing the situation and needs in partner countries (Professionalisation of work-based basic education);     Pilot test of the developed products in practice in all project partner countries.

The only Slovene nuclear power plant is based at the outskirts of the city.     Ludvik, a former national speedway champion, is a bitter widower, who transports illegal immigrants every night from the Croatian to the Italian border with his van. His boss sends to him the young and inexperienced Rudi to serve as his assistant.     On the first drive Ludvik challenges Rudi a few times; a beautiful Macedonian girl is only one of their victims. Rudi experiences a moral dilemma. After returning home to Kr\u0161ko, they get drunk together and Ludvik accepts Rudi as one of his own. They go to races together and almost every night transport immigrants from all over the world past the nuclear plant. Rudi quickly gets rid of his moral reservations; he becomes tough and relentless.     The hope for better future, which Europe represents to the refugees, often turns into serious human drama through the depiction of the miserable existence of their \"guides\"\u2026     director's statement     (dialogue from the film): LUDVIK: Half of them end up like spare parts anyway.

        "text":" ANDREJ MARU\u0160I\u010c INSTITUTE     On the 14th of October 2011 the UP PINT (University of Primorska, Primorska Institute for Natural and Technical Sciences) in Koper was renamed to the University of Primorska, Andrej Maru\u0161i\u010d Institute (UP IAM). As from this date the Institute legally operates under the new name (hereinafter referred to as UP IAM). UP PINT was founded in 1999 as an independent public research institution and as such registered in the register of the District Court of Koper on the 27th of September 1999.     UP IAM carries out fundamental and applied research, is involved in international scientific cooperation, and establishes connections with similar organizations around the world, in line with its development program. With its researchers, habilitated teachers and assistants, UP IAM is involved in educational activities of the University of Primorska (UP) and cooperates with members and Associated members of the UP in designing proposals for new courses and new programs of UP, as well as in establishing new faculties.     Through its researchers and staff, UP IAM engages in public debates on important social issues that are taking place in the realm of daily politics, and of professional and general public.     MISSION AND VISION UP IAM     The mission of UP IAM     Natural sciences and technology are foundations on which industry is based, therefore their high quality development is of strategic importance. In the UP, UP FAMNIT and UP IAM are responsible for development of natural sciences and technology. Both institutions are committed to making continuous efforts towards excellent work quality and to persisting in their efforts to move closer to the top of the scientific world. Being on top entails not only being successful within one field, but requires an excellent interdisciplinary performance, which involves working beyond traditional and sharp divisions among the basic areas of human science (natural sciences, technology, social sciences, and humanities). Basic questions of humankind are simply too complex to allow for answers only using tools or through the perspective of a single scientific discipline. Therefore, both institutions seek primarily to develop a single, uniform or linked science.     The research activities are organized into four research and development units: Department of Technology, Department of Mathematics, Department of Information Science and Technologies, and Department of Health Study.     Department of Information Science and Technologies conducts research on data structures, data mining, large-scale distributed GRID architectures, and other. At the Department of Mathematics research is carried out mainly in algebra, combinatorics and graph theory with probability theory. The research work of both departments is embedded in the field of mathematical modeling and computer simulations, experimental economics and study of social systems. Both units integrate scientific computing in different areas of natural sciences, from chemistry to bioinformatics. In addition to these topics, the students who participate in research projects can gain insight in the areas of electronic data security - cryptography, data protection and computer security.     The core activity of the Department of Technology is environment protection and the technology associated with it. The department cooperates well with industry and various Slovenian institutes, with the main focus in practical development-oriented research. Students are encouraged to get involved in various ways in the research work within the department. They can help in carrying out measurements with our own measurement instruments, in in-situ measurements of air pollution using the latest technologies, in developing software support for the analysis and display of results of air pollution measurements, in upgrading software to support the implementation of measurements using lidar system, in the mathematical-statistical modelling, in solving various logistical and combinatorial problems, etc.     Department of Health Study operates in the field of mental health research (suicidology, psychology) and e-health.     On the 14th of March 2011, based on the decision of Scientific Council, Slovenian Centre for Suicide Research was established within UP IAM. This is the first centre of this kind in Slovenia.The initiator of this idea was Professor Dr. Diego De Leo, who wanted to continue the work of his late colleague Assoc. Professor Dr. Andrej Maru\u0161i\u010d, and proposed the establishment of an independent unit within the UP IAM: \u201cSlovenian Centre for Suicide Research\" (SCSR). With the establishment of the centre, two main topics will be adressed: understanding and prevention of suicide, both essential subjects of clinical research work. One of the research groups at the UP IAM has been already working in this field for several years, thus immediately upon the establishment, the SCSR was included in EU and national projects, and initiated a number of innovative approaches in suicidology. This way, the SCSR is realizing its mission: \"to provide high quality research for better understanding and interpretation of suicidal behavior, which will contribute to the prevention of suicides and to a better support of those who lose their loved ones due to suicide.\"     Through its research activity, UP IAM is involved in the local, regional, national and international environment in a broad sense. UP IAM works with local enterprises and industry (Luka Koper dd, Koper Municipality, Harpha Sea) and with industry at the regional and national level (Result Ltd, Parsek, Abelium Ltd.). UP IAM cooperates with the universities of Ljubljana, Maribor and Nova Gorica, as well as with other institutions. At the international level, it cooperates with a number of universities abroad (Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Montenegro, New Zealand, Norway, Serbia, Slovakia, South Korea, United Kingdom, and USA).     The involvement of UP IAM at the regional, national and international level was obtained mostly through its implementation of environmental, chemical and technological studies. Based on these projects, UP IAM was authorized in 2009 by the Slovenian Environment Agency (ARSO) to carry out operational monitoring - evaluation of the overall burden of ambient air with respect to the amount of particles PM10.     The vision of UP IAM     The most important parts of the vision of UP IAM can be summarized as follows:     To become a regional, national and global center for certain important areas of natural sciences and technology, and to establish close partnership links with industry and with it a common technological development park.     To reach about 40 SCI publications per year.     To add a technical (engineering) unit for works with robotics and cyber systems.     To carry out and develop, in collaboration with UP FAMNIT, study programs in natural sciences, biopsychology, suicidology and technology.     To continue with the development of constitutional and other legal aspects of the above mentioned sciences, at the same time continuing its work in the field of human rights and freedoms.     To confirm that expectations are being met by implementing regular external evaluations.     DEPARTMENTS AND CURRENT PROJECTS OF UP IAM     Department of Mathematics     One of the four major global centres for algebraic graph theory operates within UP FAMNIT and UP IAM. The reputation of the members of the department is evident for example by the organization of the international scientific conference \"Bled \u201911 - 7th Slovenian International Conference on Graph Theory\" - the largest conference in the field of graph theory in the world, which was attended by nearly 300 researchers from 42 different countries (including leading world experts). In the week after the conference in Bled, a doctoral PhD summer school Algebraic Graph Theory Summer School in Rogla was organized, with over 80 participants from 19 countries.     Department of Mathematics has a high international reputation, which is evident from the number of citations of their scientific works, number of invitations to the various prestigious universities abroad, as well as from the fact that each year we host a number of scientists from abroad (in 2011 we hosted researchers from Australia, Canada, China, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovakia, Russia, USA, ...). In 2011, one member of the department went on a five months training at the University of Wisconsin Madison in the USA, and another member carried out a five-month stay at Ohio State University funded by a Fulbright scholarship.     Members of the Department are also active in popularization of mathematics. They participate in the organization of summer schools at UP FAMNIT, series of popular mathematical lectures \u201cExcursions into Mathematical Universe\u201d, and deliver layman lectures at Slovenian primary and secondary schools.     Regarding research projects, the year 2011 was extremely successful for the Department of Mathematics. They got two ARRS projects, two post-doctoral projects, two young researcher grants, an EU funded project, eight projects promoting Slovenian mathematics abroad, two bilateral projects with the USA, a bilateral project with Hungary and a bilateral project with South Korea. Currently the Department carries out one research program, three basic research projects, a European project on mathematics, which for the first time is coordinated from Slovenia - EuroGiga ESF project (http:\/\/www.gregas.eu\/), 2 post-doctoral projects and 16 bilateral projects. Members of the Department are also involved in numerous projects carried out by other departments at UP IAM. Currently they are training three young researchers; in October 2012 two new young researchers will be joining.     Department of Technology     The Department of Technology is actively involved in the research regarding the problem of environmental pollution, the understanding of which requires an involvement of several disciplines and research areas. In addition to ecological aspects, also economic, social and technical aspects need to be taken into consideration. Of particular importance is a proper, prompt and effective informing of the public. For this purpose, we developed a system for comprehensive presentation of meteorological information and data on air pollution (TARU). The measured data can be accessed and are displayed via sampling meteorological stations through presentational environmental systems and through the Internet. These measurements have been carried out for several years for the needs of the Port of Koper, and for the Municipality of Koper.     Department of Information Science and Technology     Department of Information Science and Technology (DIST) is actively involved in research and teaching in the following areas of theoretical and applied computer science:     Intelligent systems, data mining and machine learning,     identifying, analyzing and understanding patterns, statistical modeling,     computer security and biometric technologies.     Department of Health Study     Department of Health Study was established in 2007 at the initiative of Assoc. Professor Dr. Andrej Maru\u0161i\u010d. It was established as a response to the lack of research and projects in the area of mental health in Slovenia, and as a counterweight to the stigma of mental disorders. Topics of research in the department are: mental disorders, mental health, suicidiology, and workplace environment improvement.     Interconnectedness of the departments     In the year 2011, UP IAM strengthened notably the interdisciplinary integration of its departments - Department of Technology and Department of Information Science and Technologies jointly participate in projects related to environmental protection, Department of Information Science and Technologies and Department of Health collaborate in the field of e-health. Department of Mathematics, with its operation and essential knowledge, assists all departments and their projects.

Cenik SIST     In telecommunication systems and therefore also in IP systems E.164 numbers (or dialled numbers related to E.164) are used by end users to identify the destination of a call. In IP systems, when an end user is attached to a terminal, the E.164 name of this end user is temporarily associated with the IP address (transport address) of the terminal (endpoint). Private numbering schemes use similar arrangements. This technical report defines the requirements for finding destinations (IP addresses of endpoints) on interconnected IP networks (systems) for calls originating on or transiting via IP telephony networks. The final destination of the call may be either the IP network itself or on the SCN. In this case the IP address needs to identify the POI to the SCN. Although the TR defines requirements for E.164 numbers, the same principles could be applied to any new naming system that might be introduced for telephony. The TR deals with obtaining IP-address (or Contact Addresses) for routing Call and Service Control Messages (including database queries) and Media Stream Packets. The TR covers the requirements for calls to all types of number structures within E.164, national and private networks and includes the support of number portability, mobility and roaming.

S tem se izognete bojazni, da bi se zadnji zaposleni v naglici pozabil sprehoditi do vrat in jih dodatno varnostno zakleniti.     Record AIR 290 je aktivni infrarde\u010di senzor, ki z ozko svetlobno zaveso pokriva celoten prostor med vrati do tal. Signal za odpiranje se spro\u017ei, ko \u010dlovek stopi v podro\u010dje svetlobne zavese. Primeren je tam, kjer se morajo vrata odpreti od blizu in brez dodatnih interakcij s strani uporabnika.     Senzor record AIS 290 je namenjen za sekundarno za\u0161\u010dito robov pri zapiranju avtomatskih vrat. Na voljo je namestitev v steni ali stropu oziroma v skriti razli\u010dici.     Elektronska kemilnik BDE-D je namenjena upravljanju avtomatskih vrat record. Krmiljenje je enostavno kot pri telefonu. Med posameznimi funkcijami izbirate samo s pritiskom na ikono. LCD zaslon z osvetlitvijo ozadja nudi podatke in informacije o stanju vrat, s simboli in besedilnimi sporo\u010dili. Na voljo je ve\u010d jezikov (tudi slovenski), kar na eni strani pove\u010dujejo prijaznost do uporabka, po drugi strani pa omogo\u010de hitrej\u0161e in cenje\u0161e servisno posredovanje.     Bacteria and viruses are mainly transmitted through the hands. When the door handle turns into a germ spreader, this is a problem for companies, especially in the hygiene sector. On many everyday things like smartphones, shopping carts, light switches or door handles adhere to the unwelcome bacteria firmly. For hospitals, doctors\u2019 surgeries, restaurants as well as the food processing industry the touchless switch is the perfect solution. Are the hands occupied with carrying shopping bags, anything else or by typing a message on the smartphone, the approach to the switch is enough and and the automatic door open.     In addition to the simple operation of the door, the record BLS 60 is hygienic to use, as at no time the skin comes into contact with the object.     There are various reasons for considering the installation of floor rails. Primarily designed for challenging environments, it ensures record-typical characteristics throughout the operational life of your door system.     For automatic doors that are only rarely opened, we provide this simple push-button switch. Available as a surface mounted version complete with an additional housing, or as a flush fitting, concealed version for installation in all current mounting frames.     Protective door screens supplement our range of classic linear sliding doors. They serve primarily to protect the door from damage, but also prevent malfunctions, for example when items are carelessly placed in the path of the door.     Pri analizi svojega neposrednega okolja detektor gibanja record RAD 290 stalno komunicira s krmilno napravo. Polje zaznavanja je definirano elektronsko. S tem je odpravljeno dolgotrajno mehansko nastavljanje senzorja. Tudi spremembe polja zaradi temperaturnih razlik so ve\u010dinoma nekriti\u010dne.     Senzor record RIC 290 je opremljen je s kombinacijo detektorjev gibanja in prisotnosti, ki spro\u017eijo odpiranje in zapiranje avtomatskih vrat z visoko stopnjo varnosti in zanesljivosti.     The contactless IR hygienic button triggers an opening impulse without having to touch its surface.     Unlike the infrared sensors of the record 290 series, the detection field of this contactless switch is very small, so that it triggers only if a targeted movement occurs in its immediate vicinity. Inadvertent triggering is thus avoided, making the record contactless switch ideal for applications in hospitals, such as when entering the operating theatre after disinfecting the hands to perform surgical operations.     The record wireless button is a wireless 868.3 MHz radio-controlled button that can be attached to almost any point up to 30m from the door. Pushing the button transmits a radio signal with an embedded code to the receiving unit at the door control, triggering an opening impulse. Piezoelectric technology makes the record wireless button maintenance-free, and also means it does not require batteries. Included is also an adhesive film, which enables you to attach the radio-controlled button to glass, tiles or even painted walls. "

        "text":" 5-Channel Power Density Reference Amplifier     PDR-V75     The PDR-Power amplifiers offer the best performance in their class, redefining expectations in the high-power compact amplifier category. Thanks to trickle-down technology, our in-house engineering team has taken many of the patent-pending technologies introduced in the industry-leading PDX series and infused them in the new PDR-Power amplifiers. The PDR-Power amps provide you with the absolute widest bandwidth, best signal-to-noise, lowest distortion and highest damping factor of any amplifier in their class without sacrificing power.     Tehnologija     Provides a boost at 40Hz to increase the impact of sound from the subwoofer. Alpine's advanced application of Class-D technology keeps the signal in the digital realm until just prior to output, and markedly improves detail in the high frequencies, thanks to enhanced time management (pulse) accuracy. The product is equipped with high pass and\/ or low pass filters which allow various configurations of your system. Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors have higher switching speeds than ordinary FETs, for faster response, better linearity.     PDX Technology Inside     Dual-Feedback Modulation Loop     When playing music, a clean, distortion-free, low-power signal input to an amplifier should exit as an identical high-power output signal to drive your speakers. In reality, most amps don\u2019t even come close to this ideal, instead adding significant audible distortion especially in the high frequencies, earning typical Class-D amplifiers a deserved reputation for bad sound. The PDR-Power\u2019s Global Modulation with Adaptive Feedback Control loop circuitry intelligently assures the power output is as clean and distortion-free as possible. Their real-time error-correction analyzes the signal not only once, but twice by comparing input signal with the output throughout the entire amplification process. In doing so, PDR-Power amplifiers ensure that their output signal delivers a clean, clear and powerful sound that must be heard to be believed.     Small, Powerful Design     The new PDR-Power series amplifiers have decreased in size compared to the X-Power, yet they pack in much more flexibility, durability with Alpine sound quality.     Unequaled Reliability     Excessive heat is the enemy of amplifiers and under extreme conditions will result in most amps shutting down completely. PDR-Power amps use a special Multi-Stage Power Management circuit that continuously monitors critical component temperatures throughout the amplifier and decreases power output if anything gets too hot. If you are playing music under heavy loads for long periods, the circuit automatically reduces power output slightly at first, and then further in a second stage if necessary. This two-stage approach provides seamless, interruption free listening experience for non-stop music playback.     Standing Alone in the Clarity Class     Ultra-Wide Frequency Bandwidth: This super-wide, industry leading frequency range offers listeners unparallel sound quality and detail that bests even the most high-end audiophile equipment.     Best Signal-to-Noise: In order to ensure that all of the industry-leading sound quality is heard at your ears, we\u2019ve worked to create a platform that offers an unbelievably low noise floor, taking extra care to ensure a clean signal path, with no extraneous inferences.     Low Distortion: PDR-Power amps offer extremely wide and linear frequency response that results in unparalleled musical detail. Extremely low distortion means pure musical performance without audible artifacts to destroy your sound experience. Additionally, these amps have extremely high stereo separation and smooth phase response, which means more dynamic realistic imaging and staging for your total musical enjoyment. On the Mono side, best-in-class low distortion and tight control will give you clean, accurate bass response.     Highest Damping Factor: With ultra-low output impedance, the new PDR-Power offers extremely controlled, tight bass for unprecedented sound quality. Damping Factor ratings are >1300 for Mono and >500 for full range models.     Sharper -24dB\/octave slope: Ensuring that your sub plays longer, accurate and cool the PDR-M65 \/ PDR-V75(Subwoofer Channel) has a -24dB octave slope in the built-in low pass filter. A sharper slope to the subwoofer allows only the desired low-end frequencies play through your subwoofer.     Podatki o modelu     All Digital Lineup     The PDR series uses much of the same digital technology as the PDX series, achieving high efficiency with excellent audio performance, including low distortion, high damping factor and high S\/N ratio     Awesome Power Density, Digital Sound Quality     Each PDR amp is unmatched in its class for power density performance (watts per cubic cm) and damping factor. You get tremendous power at all levels, with hardhitting bass. S\/N ratios and frequency response are also outstanding.     Remote Control Bass Knob (RUX-KNOB)     Simply add the RUX-KNOB (sold separately) and get full control from inside the dash for remote on-the-fly bass adjustments. You also have the ability to control multiple amps from just one controller with simple telephone cord adapters.     Rotatable Illuminated Alpine Badge     PDR-Power amplifiers come with a rotatable illuminated badge that makes a very attractive presentation when mounted vertical or horizontally.     Topside Controls and Adjustments     Topside controls on top of the PDR-Power amplifiers make installation and tuning easier than its predecessors. Just unscrew two fasteners and you\u2019ll have access to all the controls needed to tune the amplifier. Their small size and versatile controls allow the PDR-Power amplifiers to easily be added to either an aftermarket or factory system and can be setup to accommodate a variety of system configurations.     Proven Power\u2014Certified From Birth     All PDR-Power amplifiers are individually tested and have certified power ratings. Each amp comes with their very own verification certificate documenting its actual power output exceeds the rating by a wide margin. "

They must provide students with an opportunity to engage their professors and peers in critical and creative reflections and discourse and not hold onto past practices that are incongruent with the needs and demands of a knowledge society. Blended learning approach, when well understood and implemented, has the potential to transform higher education. On the other hand, when considering blended learning, there is, of course, no single perfect blend - the concept is grounded on the notion of flexibility. In addition, blended learning can provide a means to rethink how we can improve teaching and learning in a cost effective manner.     The combined approach of using ICT with more traditional tutor-led teaching seems to appeal to many learners. It has the advantage of group interaction, listening and speaking practice as well as allowing the learners to work at their own individual pace or area of interest. Guidance and assistance from the tutor gives confidence to those learners with little previous experience of using ICT, making the learning experience more rewarding as both language and ICT skills are being practiced.     Online learning is one of the fastest growing trends in educational uses of technology. This form of learning is a far cry from the televised broadcasts and videoconferencing that characterized earlier generations of distance education. Moreover, interest in hybrid approaches that blend in-class and online activities is increasing. A survey of e-learning at 274 colleges and universities in the United States found that 80 percent of undergraduate higher education institutions and 93 percent of doctoral institutions offer blended learning courses (Arabasz and Baker, 2003). The idea of blended language learning emerged at the Faculty of Management, University of Primorska in Koper, Slovenia, almost at the same time, when teachers became aware that a more experiential, inquiry-based and hands-on learning approach is required and that more responsibility should be transferred to students for their work, i.e. goal setting, record-keeping, monitoring and evaluation. Students, teachers agreed, need more choice for choosing their own materials, writing topics, research projects etc. and thus decided to:     1. Prepare a number of guidelines (on effective writing, on oral and written presentations, on summarising and note-taking, on language awareness, etc.)     2. Set up appropriate e-Lecture rooms (say, by using Moodle, which is an effective open source software package designed to help teachers create online courses)     3. Build their own WWW pages     4. Prepare language portfolio for students     5. Familiarise students with computer-assisted language learning     6. Keep encouraging students in their efforts to master the foreign language.     2. History of CALL in Slovenia     In Slovenian higher education institutions, e-learning programmes continue to evolve as they grow out of infancy. As a matter of fact, online instruction has become increasingly popular as a mode of instruction in many higher education institutions. Despite the fact that some tertiary education language teachers are still more comfortable with textbooks and because some teachers believe that the use of computers threatens traditional literacy skills (which are heavily tied to books), there is a growing number of younger language teachers who are aware of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) not just because of the importance of the technology in their work, but because ICT is changing the ways in which English can be taught. These language teachers are also aware that web-based language learning solutions will only be used successfully if they can be seamlessly combined with tried and tested traditional learning and teaching approaches in pedagogically relevant ways and have a high value-added at reasonable additional costs. In other words, teachers should not be interested in adopting technology for technology's sake, should not deprive students of interaction with their professors nor offer irrelevant content and trivial tasks in their e-Lecture rooms.     The beginnings of CALL in Slovenia can be traced back to the 1990s, when the Bank of English, Sara and other concordancing software were used for various language learning purposes, most often related to the vocabulary and grammar of a given foreign language both in general and business courses. In such language courses, the participants carried out practical work with vocabulary and grammar frequency lists, concordances, key word lists, collocations, etc. In addition, corpus techniques enabled corpus-based reference dictionaries and grammars (e.g. COBUILD Dictionary and Grammar, Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English and Chemnitz Internet Grammar of English) as well as corpus-based evaluation of ELT textbooks and grammars. The introduction of software e-learning platforms (e.g., Moodle) in language courses represents the second wave of CALL in many private and public higher education institutions in Slovenia. Teachers quickly recognised that the accessibility of online resources is a benefit, which may encourage students to practice outside the classroom.     During this period, individual teachers also tried to encourage their students to use blogs, wikis, Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds and other web tools in order to improve their language skills. The main purpose of these efforts was to find a route to better teaching\/learning, more motivated students and more successful courses.     Let me briefly describe the first phase of CALL at FM, during which computers, a database (BNC) and a software package (Sara) were used in order to investigate the system of past and present tenses, simple, progressive and perfect, their function and differences in meaning and the frequency of occurrences of particular tenses. During the academic year 2006-2007, a group of 38 first year students, studying at the Faculty of Management and the author of this article decided to have a closer look at the English tense system. Despite the fact that they have attended English courses for, on average, eight years, they are still frequently in doubt about which tense to use both in their written assignments and oral presentations. Our hypothesis was (a) that rules in textbooks cannot describe the English tense system in all its complexity (Hypothesis 1) and (b) that progressive and perfect tenses are used in less than 10% of cases (Hypothesis 2). First, our investigation centred on the explanations concerning tenses as given in a textbook used for first year students at the Faculty of Management in Koper.     First, a random set of ten verbs in a specific tense was chosen to find out the number of occurrences, and second, different usages and functions of particular tenses were searched. The verbs chosen were break, decide, feel, give, look, meet, read, skim, stop, and want, half of them regular and the other half irregular verbs. No other special criteria were followed in the choice of verbs.     Two issues concerning English tenses were addressed, namely, rules given by textbooks and the internet sites vs. rules arrived at by concordancing a set of verbs in corpus (BNC) and frequencies of tense forms of the same set of verbs. It was proved, first, that the number of rules offered by textbooks, and Internet sites is too small to describe the variety of uses in English tense system and, second, that progressive and perfect forms (of chosen verbs) occur in less than 5% of cases, and simple forms in almost 95% of sentences, thus confirming both hypothesis in their entirety. In addition, corpus examples are important in language learning as they expose students to the kinds of sentences and structures, which they will encounter when using the language in real-life business situations. Students who are taught with traditional textbooks are often unable to analyse more complex structures, because there are considerable differences between what textbooks are teaching and how native speakers actually use language as evidenced in the corpora. Teaching based on non-empirical teaching materials can be misleading, whereas corpus-based studies inform us about usages that are more common and to which more attention should be given.     The results clearly showed that the use of tenses is very often verb-dependable; therefore, students should be at least informed about such dependency. Students also agreed that hard and fast rules regarding tenses should be substituted by corpus-based data-driven hypothesis testing learner-centred notions. Oversimplified views about the system of English tenses stated in textbooks and on the majority of the Internet sites are responsible for many of the problems that students of (Business) English have in making their decisions about the correct tense usage. According to na\u00efve theories of meaning, grammatical tense directly reflects the threefold division of time, each tense referring to the appropriate sector of time. I strongly believe that anyone working in any field of language study, language description, or - even more so - language teaching should use corpora as a source for language research. Unfortunately, the English language teaching profession has been rather slow to incorporate corpus methods into its working practices. On the contrary, materials and teachers rely on a well-established canon of apparently self-evident 'facts' about the language, which have, more or less, the status of tradition in which knowledge is simply handed down from teacher to student. Corpus-based approach in teaching represents a shift towards a more learner-centred paradigm of discovery learning, which enables students to test their own hypotheses and discover their own rules in the process of the so-called data-driven learning.     The second phase of CALL at FM took place in the academic year 2007-2008, two e-lecture rooms were set up using Moodle. The layout of both e-lecture rooms was similar. Both consisted of an introductory section in which the course objectives, assignments and course requirements were described. The e-lecture room for the first-year students comprised of eight sections (two for each week), in which the main activities were described and written texts and MP3s were available for downloading. The texts in this section were related to the topics that were discussed during the F2F sessions (the topics were the qualities of good managers, business etiquette, company structure and organisation, entertaining, describing trends, presentations, telephoning, business trips and annual reports). In addition, a set of guidelines was prepared for the students.     The e-lecture room for the second-year students also comprised of eight sections (two for each week), but with a selection of materials on the following topics: human resources and job interviews, international trade, banking, stock exchange, mergers and acquisitions, marketing, advertising, the European Union (EU) and commercial correspondence. A section called 'Resources' represented the links to useful Internet sites; the section called 'Miscellaneous Resources' consisted of the materials that students could use in order to improve their language skills by studying on their own.     Both e-lecture rooms also had an additional section with sample tests and a section in which a number of longer texts were available for downloading. Both groups of students could also download the Language Portfolio for students of management, which has been prepared by the author of this article according to the common criteria accepted throughout Europe.     3. Research purpose     The main purpose of our efforts was to find a route to better teaching\/learning, more motivated students and more successful courses through the implementation of computer technologies - from multimedia to the Internet - and to assess their potential for language learning and teaching in post-secondary education in Slovenia.     4. Research aims     Our aims were to provide a more flexible approach to language learning, encourage learner autonomy, personalise the learning experience improve the retention rate, and to find a route to more motivated students and more successful courses. If the ultimate goal of educational experience is not to acquire fragments of information but to collaboratively construct core concepts and schema based on important ideas and information, then carefully planned blended language courses have the potential to evolutionary transform teaching and learning in higher education.     What is needed are academic courses and programmes aimed at meeting the lifelong and just-in-time education needs of various target groups of students. In their efforts to maintain or enhance their competitiveness faculties and universities should strive to be proactive and innovative, which can, to some extent, be done by moving from f2f interaction into blended mode of teaching\/learning. Equally important, students in higher education institutions with advanced foreign language skills need rich input in terms of quality, quantity, variety, genuineness and relevance.     Following our initial research activity carried out during the academic year 2009-2010 on a group of full-time students, we carried out a second research study by focusing on three groups of part-time students at two higher education institutions, the Faculty of management in Koper and the International Business School in Ljubljana, with the aim to find out if there are any (considerable) differences in the perception of blended language practices between full-time and part-time students.     5. Expected results     We expected that a sound approach to blended language learning in both groups of students (full-time and part-time) and at both higher education institutions (the Faculty of Management and the International Business School) would provide a positive learning experience. It was expected that students will like the diversified learning concept offered by the blended language learning approach, that they will accept the variety and quality of materials with keen interest and enthusiasm and that they will value highly the flexibility of time and space offered by the blended language learning approach.     On the other hand, we also predicted that there might be some motivation problems, minor technical problems and that some students may find the workload too high.     6. Work methodology     In order to assess the satisfaction of students participating in the blended learning Business English course at the Faculty of Management Koper a questionnaire was prepared in which we inquired about students' computer and Internet literacy as well as about their satisfaction with the Business English e-lecture room and online activities. The questionnaire consisted of a set of closed ended questions (multiple choice and scaled questions) and a set of open-ended questions (unstructured questions).     We obtained useful information about students' computer skills, Internet skills, e-mail skills, the amount of their time spent on the Internet, and their awareness of different services provided on the Internet (e-mail, search engines, remote login, file transfer protocol, discussion groups, bulletin board services, frequently asked questions and chatting). We also asked the participants how the Internet influenced their academic efficiency. Students were asked about their attitude towards blended language learning experience, and had to assess (on a scale from 1-not useful to 5-extremely useful) the usefulness of documents and activities available in the e-Lecture room. Last but not least, we wanted to know to what extent they were satisfied with the Business English e-Lecture room and if they think that e-Lecture room could replace f2f teaching. The respondents were also encouraged to make suggestions to improve Business English e-Lecture room.     7. Results and discussion     In order to introduce e-learning\/teaching practice at the Faculty of Management in Koper (The University of Primorska, Slovenia) in the academic year 2009\/2010 two e-lecture rooms were set up using Moodle, a free software e-learning platform. Moodle has a significant user base with 38,896 registered sites with 16,927,590 users in 1,713,438 courses (as of January, 2008) and is designed to help educators create online courses with opportunities for rich interaction, is modular in construction and can readily be extended by creating plugins for specific new functionality. Moodle's infrastructure supports many types of plugins: activities, resource types, question types, data field types, graphical themes, authentication methods, etc.     Following the first research carried out during the academic year 2009-2010 and in order to test the blended language learning concept on a group of part-time students three additional e-lecture rooms were set up prior to the academic year 2010-2011.     The layout of all e-lecture rooms was similar. They all consisted of an introductory section in which course objectives, assignments and course requirements were described. The e-lecture room for the first year students comprised of eight sections, two for each week, in which main activities were described and written texts and MP3s were available for downloading. Texts in this section were related to topics discussed during the f2f sessions (Topics were qualities of good managers, business etiquette, company structure and organisation, entertaining, describing trends, presentations, telephoning, business trips and annual reports). In addition, a set of guidelines was prepared for students (e.g. guidelines for oral presentations, general course guidelines, guidelines for summarising and note-taking, guidelines for writing e-mail, guidelines for the English Tense System, guidelines for writing a CV, etc.)     The e-lecture room for second year students also comprised of eight sections, two for each week, but with a selection of materials on the following topics: human resources and job interviews, international trade, banking, stock exchange, mergers and acquisitions, marketing, advertising, the European Union and commercial correspondence. A section called Resources represented links to useful Internet sites; the section called Miscellaneous Resources consisted of materials students could use in order to improve their language skills.     Before the beginning of academic year 2010-2011, three more e-lecture rooms were designed. The layout of these new e-lecture rooms was identical to the previously designed e-lecture rooms, some of the materials were updated, new texts were added, some old texts were not included and some minor changes were made with regard to the overall layout.     Both e-lecture rooms also had an additional section with sample tests and a section in which a number of longer texts were available for download. Both groups of students could also download the Language Portfolio for students of management, which has been prepared by the author of this article according to common criteria accepted throughout Europe. The document contains a detailed language biography describing the student's experiences in languages and is designed to guide the learner in planning and assessing progress. The language portfolio has two main aims: 1. to motivate students by acknowledging their efforts to extend and diversify their language skills and 2. to provide a record of the linguistic and cultural skills students have acquired. The pedagogic functions of the Portfolio are: a) to enhance students' motivation, b) help students to reflect their objectives, ways of learning and success in language learning, c) help students to learn autonomously and d) encourage students to enhance their language and cultural experience.     The number of pages for students to download exceeded several thousand, and ranged from (business) vocabulary exercises, proficiency tests, interview tips, features of social language, recommended additional study literature, information on various language corpuses, notes on efficient learning and cultural differences, to name but a few. The texts available in the e-lecture room were prepared by the teacher during his 20-year practice as a teacher of Business English in higher education institutions in Slovenia and had been extensively trialled with students before being used in any of the e-lecture rooms.     Active class participation, home assignments in the form of writing short summaries on a weekly basis, posting a number of comments on topics related to the discussed issues during face-to-face lectures were essential prerequisites for students to be entitled to take the final written and oral examination. Students had to participate in at least two forums on a business topic started by the teacher. They had to write at least six posts and comment upon at least twice as many posts written by their fellow students.     80 full-time first year (30 participants) and second year (50 participants) students took part in the blended English language course. In accordance with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, the participating students were independent users of English (ranging from B1 to B2 level). 83 % or 25 first year students and 92 % or 46 second year students fulfilled all course requirements in due time. The second research activity carried out during the academic year 2010-2011 included 70 part-time students who were also independent users of English (B1 to C1). 85 % of full-time students managed to fulfil all course requirements in due time and passed the final exam.     The analysis of questionnaires has shown that in both groups, the blended English course was judged as \"good\" or \"very good\" without any exception. The following aspects were regarded as especially positive by both groups of students (full-time and part-time):     the diversified learning concept     the variety and quality of the multimedia learning materials     the new learning experience with the chat     the possibility to direct one's own learning process and the flexibility of time and space     the communication contact with other participants and the teacher.     On the whole, adjusting to this new form of course was judged as unproblematic. This is due to the fact that all full-time students rated their current computer skills as either very good (second year students) or good to very good (first year students). Their Internet skills were rated as good (10 first year students or 66 %; 36 second year students or 72 %) and their e-mail skills as very good by both groups of students. On average, students in both groups spend a substantial share of their time on the Internet. Only four (or 13 %) first year students spend just 2-4 hours a week on the Internet, one student spends between 5-6 hours on the Internet, while 5 students (17 %) spend on the Internet between 7 and 9 hours a week. Six students in their first year of study spend between 10 and 20 hours online and 14 students or 63 % of all students spend more than 20 hours a week on the Internet. Second year students spend on the Internet even more time. 26 students (52 %) wrote that they spend more than 20 hours a week online, 11 or 22 % of second year students spend between 7 and 9 hours on the Internet, 8 (16 %) students spend between 10 to 20 hours online, only three (6 %) students are online between 5 and 6 hours weekly and two second year students are online between two and four hours a week.     With regard to the part-time students, the following differences and similarities are worth mentioning:     the Internet skills of part-time students were most often rated as very good (75 %);     part-time students spend slightly less time on the Internet (on average, 66 % of students spend 2-4 hours on the Internet, while the remaining 33 % of students spend on the Internet either between 5-6 hours or less than 2 hours a week).     Students (both full-time and part-time) had proper awareness of different services provided on the Internet, with a clear preferences for www, e-mail and search engines, followed by FTP, discussion groups and chatting in both groups of students. With regard to the influence of the use of the Internet on students' academic efficiency, respondents in both groups (part-time and full-time) believe that the use of conventional documents has decreased and that the dependency on the Internet has increased substantially.     Despite the fact that students in both groups (full-time and part-time) were, on average, very satisfied with the Business English e-lecture room (18 or 60 % of first year full-time students were fully satisfied and 12 or 40 % of full-time students were partially satisfied; 41 or 82 % of second year full-time students were fully satisfied and 9 or 18 % of full-time students were partially satisfied; similarly, 64 % of part-time students were fully satisfied with the blended course, with 36 % of part-time students being partially satisfied), only one full-time student thought that e-Lecture room could replace f2f teaching completely.     Students' attitude towards blended language learning experience was, on average, between positive and very positive in both groups of respondents, with almost 84 % of second year students who would recommend e-lectures to a friend and 73 % of first year students who would do the same. The results for the part-time students differed slightly, with 85 % (or 60 students) who would recommend blended activities to their friends.     All students frequently printed out at least some documents connected with individual sessions, which were - on a scale from 1 - not useful at all to 5 - extremely useful - ranked with 4.7 by second year students and 4.3 by first year students, whereas the usefulness of online activities was ranked slightly lower by both groups of students (by 3.9 and 3.6 respectively). Part-time students ranked the documents as extremely useful (4,4) and activities as useful (3.8). Chapelle (2001) points out that one criterion of CALL task appropriateness is 'learner fit'. If the language level of a task is too easy, learners will not develop their ability, if too difficult, they will give up. In Slovenian higher education environment learners are sometimes mixed into classes without regard to their L2 level, or taught in ways that do not match their goals or learning styles. Other researchers report the same problems (Felder & Henriques, 1995; Robinson, 2002).     Among the most interesting suggestions to improve the Business English e-lecture room the following should be pointed out: video-recorded face-to-face lectures could be added to the e-Lecture room for students who missed lectures, short video clips could be added, some students wished there would be more team-work and project work.     Both full-time and part-time students pointed out the following obstacles: some minor technical problems were mentioned, some activities were too time-consuming and therefore frustrating; some students found the work-load to be (too) high; some texts too difficult to understand, the possibility of self-organisation bore the risk of \"shallow\" learning activities, and there were also some motivation problems, especially in the group of first year students and part-time students.     8. Conclusion     In Slovenia, the potential of blended learning as a catalyst for change in higher education has been recognized by some teachers who are rethinking their teaching and learning approaches. What these teachers have discovered is that more attention should be given to student needs and the varying learning styles of individual students, with lecture rooms developed into independent communities. Students' brain and their mind's natural curiosity should be engaged by complex and meaningful challenges through activities that require full brain interaction and communication. Isolated pieces of information offered by textbooks make learning difficult and should thus be avoided. Facts and skills in isolation should not be practiced, because they inevitably lead in rote-learning and regurgitating. Equally important, learning should be fun, despite the fact that for some students learning is - and should be - hard work. Last but not least, learning involves learning to learn, which is too often excluded in Business English textbooks, but in blended course the teacher's main role should become the role of a facilitator, who is spending more time recommending and directing students to resources and helping them to interpret these resources. In other words, the role of the teacher is to monitor progress, give feedback, boost confidence and maintain motivation.     It can be argued that the highly volatile higher education environment of the 21st century needs managers and teachers who will be able to transform tertiary education institutions in order to respond to the constant changes. What is needed are academic courses and programmes that aim to meet the lifelong and just-in-time education needs of various target groups of students. In their efforts to maintain or enhance their competitiveness, universities and faculties should strive to be proactive and innovative. This can, to some extent, be done by moving from F2F interaction into blended mode provision, forming university\/industry strategic alliances or addressing the niche markets that are ignored by competitors. Technology-related developments are change drivers that have significantly reshaped tertiary education in pursuit of flexible lifelong learning, new learning paradigms and online delivery.     In our research, the following strengths of blended language learning\/teaching were identified:     preferred for convenience, retention and efficiency in asynchronous communication     promotes life-long learning     On the other hand, the following weaknesses were identified:     lack of personal communication     loss of context (poorly edited or unrelated pieces of information can be difficult to understand)     minor technical problems may occur     motivation problems (especially for students with poor language skills)     information overload (students can receive too difficult, unwanted or irrelevant information of little use to them)     increased teacher workload.     Similar findings were found in Pena-Sanchez and Hicks (Pena-Sanchez and Hicks, 2006) who reported that e-mail could be considered to be an innovative e-learning tool and whose findings impact both managers and educators and their choice of communication media. On the other hand, e-materials for language learning are not always based on valid didactic concepts and display a narrow degree of innovation.     Today, the needs of students cannot be met simply by the imperfect fine-tuning of the status quo in higher education institutions. Thus, online learning environments should go beyond the replication of learning events that traditionally occur in the classroom and are made available through the Internet. Online learning\/teaching environments provide for different ways of learning and the construction of a potentially richer learning environment that provides for fresh approaches to learning caters for different learning styles, as well as allows for greater diversification in learning and greater access to learning. Such learning environments should supplement or complement traditional F2F learning environments or may, on the other hand, provide a complete learning package that requires little F2F contact.     With new technologies, the world of teaching and learning is not less complex; on the contrary, it is richer and more demanding. The technology-enhanced business English learning\/teaching practice at the Faculty of Management Koper strengthens my belief that blended learning\/teaching should be further developed and offered to both part-time and full-time students because it involves the learning process, which is learner-centred and autonomy-based. In addition, the rich resources of language learning materials put the students in the position of decision-makers with regard to the content of their study. Equally important, the language environment provides the learners with learning stimuli for both language competence and new contents and reflections on language and intercultural phenomena, as well as on the aspects of the learning process. Our aims were also to provide a more flexible approach to language learning, encourage learner autonomy, personalise the learning experience improve the retention rate, and to find a route to more motivated students and more successful courses. If the ultimate goal of educational experience is not to acquire fragments of information but to collaboratively construct core concepts and schema based on important ideas and information, then carefully planned blended language courses have the potential to evolutionary transform teaching and learning in higher education.     Blended language learning\/teaching provides an acceptable means to question traditional face-to-face learning experiences in terms of not fully capitalizing on the opportunities offered by the Internet. At the same time, control of the learning experience is being transferred to the students who should engage in online and class activities armed with the most current information and be prepared to engage in the creative process of making sense of the information.     The knowledge society and ubiquitous communications technologies have precipitated significant changes in the society, which consequently led to the transformation of higher education institutions with the concept of blended (language) learning as a powerful tool to mobilize innovation.

SUMMARY     Blended learning is the collocation commonly used to describe courses that combine face-to-face classroom instruction with computer-based learning. Blended courses move a significant part of course learning online and, as a result, reduce the amount of classroom contact hours. Blended learning offers a real opportunity to create learning experiences that can provide the right learning at the right time and in the right place for students in tertiary education institutions, thus becoming one of the most convincing concepts in learning of the 21st century.     Despite the fact that the vast majority of foreign language teaching in Slovenia is still carried out in face-to-face environments, a growing extent of foreign language teaching in a number of higher education institutions has moved, at least partly, online. In this research, the development of e-learning practice at the Faculty of Management, University of Primorska, and the International Business School is described, together with the changing role of teachers in blended language teaching\/learning environments. Blended language learning\/teaching provides an acceptable means to question traditional face-to-face learning experiences in terms of not fully capitalizing on the opportunities offered by the Internet.

Ob tem se spra\u0161ujemo, kdaj bomo v Sloveniji vodilne politike, ki bodo imeli tak\u0161ne navdihujo\u010de govore?     \"Thank you Karen and Charlotte, and thank all of you on behalf of Pres. Donald Trump, my wife Karen, and my daughter Charlotte.     I'd like to welcome you all to Washington DC for the 44th annual March for life. It's a good day. It's the best day I've ever seen for the March for life, in more ways than one.     I'm deeply humbled to stand before you today. I\u2019m deeply humbled to be the first vice president of the United States to ever have the privilege to attend this historic event.     More than 240 years ago, our founders wrote words that have echoed through the ages.     They declared these truths to be self-evident that we are, all of us, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.     44 years ago, our Supreme Court turned away from the first of these timeless ideals.     But today, three generations hence, because of all of you, and the many thousands that stand with us in marches like this all across the nation, life is winning again in America.     That is evident in the election of pro-life majorities and the Congress of the United States of America. But it is no more evident, in any way, than in the historic election of a president who stands for a stronger America, a more prosperous America, and a president who, I proudly say, stands for the right to life \u2013 President Donald Trump.     President Trump actually asked me to be here with you today. He asked me to thank you for your support, for your stand for life, and for your compassion for the women and children of America.     One week ago today on the steps of the Capitol we saw the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States. I can tell you firsthand, our president is a man with broad shoulders and a big heart. His vision, his energy, his optimism are boundless and I know that he will make America great again.     From his first day in office he's been keeping his promises to the American people.     I like to say that over there at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., we are in the promise-keeping business.     That's why on Monday, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy to prevent foreign aid from funding organizations that promote or perform abortions worldwide.     That's why this administration will work with the Congress to end taxpayer funding of abortion and of abortion providers, and we will devote those resources to healthcare services for women across America.     And that's why next week, President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.     You know, life is winning in America. And today is a celebration of that progress that we have made in this cause. You know I\u2019ve long believed that a society can be judged by how we care for its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.     We have come to an historic moment in the cause for life. And we must meet this moment with respect and compassion for every American.     Life is winning in America for many reasons.     Life is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life begins, more and more, every day. Life is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families to open their hearts and homes to children in need. Life is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations who minister to women in towns across this country.     And life is winning through the quiet counsels between mothers and daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters, between friends across kitchen tables, and over coffee at college campuses. The truth is being told. Compassion is overcoming convenience. And hope is defeating despair.     In a word, life is winning in America because of all of you.     So I urge you to press on. But as it is written, \u2018Let your gentleness be evident to all.\u2019 Let this movement be known for love, not anger. Let this movement be known for compassion, not confrontation. When it comes to matters of the heart, there is nothing stronger than gentleness.     I believe that we will continue to win the hearts and minds of the rising generation if our hearts first break for young mothers and their unborn children, and if we each of us do all we can to meet them where they are, with generosity, not judgment.     To heal our land and restore a culture of life we must continue to be a movement that embraces all, cares for all, and shows respect for the dignity and worth of every person.     Enshrined on the walls of the Jefferson Memorial are the words of our third president, who admonished us, so long ago, to remember that God gave us life and gave us liberty.     On behalf of the President of the United States and my little family we thank you for your stand for life. We thank you for your compassion. We thank you for your love for the women and children of America.     And be assured, be assured, that along with you, we will not grow weary, we will not rest until we restore a culture of life in America for ourselves and our posterity. Thank you and God bless you.     Komentarji     Va\u0161e mnenje     Ali ste vedeli, da vsakemu nerojenemu otroku bije srce \u017ee od 3 tedna po spo\u010detju naprej?

Directed by Jelena Sitar, music by Igor Cvetko, produced by Ljubljana Puppet Theatre.     While the puppetry depot is still housed at the Ljubljana Puppet Theatre, the selected puppets created by Milan Klemen\u010di\u010d are also on display in the Museum of Puppetry opened in 2015 at Ljubljana Castle.     Milan Klemen\u010di\u010d Collection     The Legacy of Milan Klemen\u010di\u010d Collection was donated to Ljubljana Puppet Theatre by the artist`s daughter, Mojca Klemen\u010di\u010d, and presented to the public as a permanent museum collection for the first time in 1990.     Housed in the attic of Ljubljana Puppet Theatre's headquarters building, the Collection presents a large part of the puppet theatre work created by painter Milan Klemen\u010di\u010d (1875\u20131957) who, while being educated as a painter in Italy and Germany, gathered the impulses and models for the establishment of his own puppet theatre. The most obvious influence is that of the famous Munich Marionetten-theater.     The collection comprises artistic and technical designs for puppet shows, puppets, scenic elements, and stage and written documents from the artist`s three main creative periods: The Little Puppet Theatre (1910\u20131917), the Slovene Puppet Theatre (1920-1924) and the Miniature Puppet Theatre (1936\u20131957). Of particular interest are the tiny, 10cm-high marionettes presented in their original stage setting \u2013 certainly one of the tiniest puppet theatres in the world.     From the last period of Klemen\u010di\u010d`s activities two shows have been preserved completely: Owl Castle (1936), and Doctor Faust (1938). On some occasions Ljubljana Puppet Theatre revived these shows and presented the artist's legacy 'live'.

        "text":" This highly recommended climbing destination is located in a peaceful environment in the shade of a forest. It is difficult to spot it from the road, but once you lay your eyes on the wall, you will be pleasantly surprised. The climbing area offers first-class white limestone, which resembles the walls in Paklenica or Vipava.     How to get there: If you come from Kobarid, turn towards Nova Gorica at a large roundabout before Tolmin. Carry on past Vol\u010de hamlet and after that pay attention to a left branch towards Kozari\u0161\u010de (after a hairpin turn outside the village). Then follow a narrow asphalt road past a smaller crossroad (a road to Terra d.o.o. company goes to the left). About 200 meters away from there, you will spot a small tree on your right. Park by the side of the road.     Access: From the parking lot head towards the forest edge across a field and you will come to the foot of the wall in about 5 minutes.     Best time for climbing: Due to the low altitude, it is possible to climb throughout the year. It is best to go in spring or autumn, but forest provides nice shade also on hot summer days.     Orientation of the wall: The climbing area faces south-west.     Warning: Parking in front of the Terra d.o.o. company building is forbidden!     This wonderfully equipped climbing area will give most pleasure to those who favor plates. More 'technical' routes with minimal handholds prevail. The rock is excellent and offers really good climbing. Sector A is partly abandoned and less popular compared to sector B. After heavy rain and in early spring some routes can be a bit wet.

Ideal for Business & Ecommerce sites looking to provide maximum visitor confidence.     What is SSL?     SSL Certificates are fundamental to internet security. They are used to establish an encrypted connection and allow data to be transmitted securely between a browser or user's computer and a server or website.     Establishes a secure connection between a browser and a server     Encrypts communication to protect sensitive information your customers provide to you     Places a padlock next to your web address in the browser     Authenticates an organization's identity     Standard SSL (Domain Validated) Certificates are the easiest and most common type of SSL certificate. OV and EV Certificates also authenticate the identity of the company or organization that holds the certificate providing more trust to end users.     With our SSL certificate services*, you won't need to take manual steps to configure and deploy new certificates every year. We generate a renewal order automatically when your certificate nears the end of its validity. After payment, we will automatically configure, validate, and provision your new certificate for you.     * Your domain must be hosted through the same hosting provider who sold the SSL certificate, and the server must use cPanel, Plesk, or DirectAdmin.     Improve Your Search Engine Ranking     Establish trust and online security for your website visitors and business.     Google wants to make the web safer and a big part of that involves making sure that the sites people access via Google are secure. That's why websites using SSL have been shown to benefit from higher ranking in search results.     There's also a lot more reasons why you should consider adding SSL to your website:     Secure online transactions     Activate HTTPS and the lock icon     Browsers have changed, don't get left behind     Web pages not served via HTTPS are now being displayed as \u2018not secure\u2019 in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Don't let your website be one of them. Add SSL today.     Secure your site in minutes with our fully automated provisioning and deployment     Upgrade to Extended Validation SSL     While all SSL certificates use similar methods to protect and validate your data, the level of trust and assertion they provide varies.     Extended Validation Certificates offer the highest level of validation and trust. They validate and display the name and location of companies and organisations to give customers added confidence when dealing with businesses online.     Domain Validation (DV)     Organization Validation (OV)     Extended Validation (EV)     While the need for online security is universal, not all SSL Certificates are created equal. The guide below is designed to help you decide which type of certificate is right for you.     Domain Validation (DV)     Verifies ownership and control of the domain name only     Issued in minutes     Maintains browser compliance     Ideal for non-critical web pages     Think of DV like getting a library card\u2014no confirmation of who you really are, very minimal requirements to obtain and issued very quickly.     Organization Validation (OV)     Enhanced validation including authenticating the identity of the applicant     Issued within one day     Maintains browser compliance     Ideal for more sensitive webpages such as login pages     Think of OV like getting a driver\u2019s license\u2014more hoops to jump through than a library card but more trusted as a form of identification.     Extended Validation (EV)     Standards-based approach to authentication, representing the highest level of authentication for SSL Certificates     Typically issued within 1-3 days     Maintains browser and other industry compliance     Ideal for sensitive webpages including ecommerce, online banking, account signups     Think of EV like getting a passport\u2014much more stringent processes, longer lead times and more verification of who you are than with a library card or driver\u2019s license.

Tip certifikata SSL OV Certifikat (Organization Validation)     What is an SSL Certificate?     SSL Certificates enable data encryption on the internet and allow data to be transmitted securely from a web server to a browser. With SSL, your website can use the https protocol and will display a padlock in end users web browsers to indicate the connection is secure.     Why do I need an SSL Certificate?     SSL Certificates are an essential part of the internet. They not only encrypt communication between your computer and the server where a website is located, but they also provide verification that a site is what it claims to be.     What are the different types of SSL?     There are 3 different levels of vetting that SSL Certificates are based upon. Domain Validated (DV) , Organization Validated (OV), and Extended Validation (EV). The major difference between the types of certificate relates to the information the Certificate Authority, RapidSSL, GeoTrust and DigiCert, requires and validates in order to issue a certificate. The higher levels of certificate require more information, and often is displayed in the browser bar. EV SSL for example turns the browser bar green and displays the organization name to visitors to generate more trust.     What is a Wildcard SSL Certificate     A Wildcard SSL certificate provides the same encryption and authentication features as other SSL certificates but can also be applied to an unlimited number of subdomains of a website. A Wildcard SSL certificate supports the root domain (example.com) as well as its subdomains. Learn more     What are the advantages of an EV SSL Certificate?     EV, or Extended Validation, is the highest class of SSL available today and gives more credibility and trust to your website than other SSL Certificates. They include features such as the green address bar and display of your company name that have been proven to boost trust and consumer confidence.     Our SSL certificates are from some of the most trusted brands in Online Security. "

Together they provide user licensing for key Microsoft server technologies.     A user CAL authorizes a user to access a server from any device (for example, when an employee accesses the server from a computer at work and another at home). A user client ML licenses the management of any number of OSEs, as long as only one user has access to them. If more than one user has access to a certain OSE or set of OSEs, an ML is necessary for each user. See below for details on the CALs and client MLs included with this product.     Benefits for Organizations     You can request this suite to user workstation licensing for six popular server products. You'll also obtain the rights to download and install management server software for Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, System Center Virtual Machine Manager, and System Center Endpoint Protection.

Microsoft Endpoint and System Center Client MLs     One Core User CAL Suite contains one of each of the following user client MLs.     Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager User Client ML allows management by Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and System Center Virtual Machine Manager.     System Center Endpoint Protection User Client ML allows protection by System Center Endpoint Protection.     The right to run management server software is included with System Center client MLs. If you request this product, you can download and install the management server software listed above. The software includes a runtime version of SQL Server Technology (SQL Server Standard Edition) to support System Center. No additional licenses are needed for management servers or SQL Server technology.     License Information     CALs and MLs do not require media, license keys, or setup codes.     CALs, ECLs, and MLs offered through TechSoup are always for the currently offered version of the server software. However, these licenses can also be used with earlier versions of the server software.     Obtaining the Server Software     Installing the server software requires you to download the software from the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) and enter a license key. You can download any available version or language for your product.     The license key allows you to install the product on as many computers as you have received licenses for. This quantity is specified in the email you receive from TechSoup after you request this product.     Expect two emails:     When your request has been approved, TechSoup will send a message to your organization email address. This email will confirm the number of licenses you have requested and provide information about how to use the VLSC once Microsoft accepts your license agreement. Make sure the email address in your organization details is up to date by visiting your account.     Microsoft will send an email welcoming your organization to the VLSC. This email will indicate that Microsoft has accepted your license agreement. After you receive this email, you'll be able to follow the steps in the first email you received from TechSoup to obtain your product through the VLSC.

        "text":" Student & Alumni Perspectives     The School of Economics and Business, encourages international exchange students to blog and share with you - in words and photos - what it can be like to study and live in Ljubljana, Slovenia     Read their blogs     Yaniv Nissim, Israel. Undergraduate study, full-time international student     During my studies at the SEB LU, I found diverse classes led by great professors and attended by students from all over the world. I enjoyed experiencing different cultures and working in teams. I also enjoyed the magical places in Slovenia.     I am confident that, thanks to my experience at the SEB LU, I am prepared to enter the business world.     Pieter Deparcq, Erasmus Exchange Student, University of Antwerp, Belgium     Since I was the first one from my university to come here, I had absolutely no clue what to expect. But it turned out to be great!! Slovenia has many different faces: a beautiful winter, a colorful spring and a warm, sunny summer. Further, you can find mountains as well as lowlands and a seaside. It also has an ideal location, near Western and Eastern Europe and the beautiful Balkan countries.     Studying at the SEB LU was also very satisfying. The International Department of the School of Economics and Business is well-organized, resulting in a large number of international students. Orientation days and the helpful people at the International Office make things much easier. And the classes are taught by experienced and skillful teachers.     And last but not least: living in Ljubljana was super!! A small but very cozy city that has a lot to offer and where it\u2019s nice to walk around and have a drink on a terrace in the sun. And then there\u2019s the student organization that organizes a lot of activities, parties as well as movie nights, cultural trips, sport activities and much more. This Erasmus semester was great!     Jukka Hyttinen, Erasmus Exchange Student, Finland     My student exchange in Ljubljana was everything I could hope for: lots of new friends, traveling, partying, and much more. SEB LU is a good school and it has some of the most characteristic teachers that I've ever had. The most important thing I experienced there was my own inner growth, going there without knowing anybody and gaining these kind of international new friends and adventures is something you can't really experience otherwise in life. The time in Ljubljana will always stay in my heart :)     Brieuc Demaeght, Erasmus Exchange Student, University of Antwerp, Belgium     At first I chose Slovenia for my Erasmus mainly for its position in the European Union; because of the adhesion of new member countries, the geographical centre has now shifted towards Slovenia. The country is also important for international trade with other countries of the Balkan and transportation throughout the European Union. I had several very interesting courses at the faculty; I enjoyed every one of them and came home with lots of additional knowledge and good grades.     Of course, apart from the studies, the Erasmus experience is a lot more. I made new friends and many of them also studied economics and will possibly play a role in my professional network later on in my career. The centre of Ljubljana is very small and you will encounter fellow students on the streets all the time. Every day, or rather, every night there is something to do at less than 10 minutes walking. For the drinks there are places all over the centre, as for food, there are student coupons. These are like reduction coupons with which you can get a full meal at many restaurants for on average about \u20ac3 including a starter or salad, a main dish and a dessert! As for an anecdote, I had an amazing tutor (= buddy in some other universities) and ended up falling in love with her. We are now happily together.     Mika Juho Matias Viskari, Erasmus Exchange Student, Haaga- Helia University of applied Sciences, Finland     Studying in an international group of students under the guidance of highly expert professors and assistants makes school life at the School of Economics and Business extremely interesting and worth participating in the interactive lectures. What makes Slovenia worth spending at least a semester or two in is the lively social life and opportunity to go snowboarding in the Alps or sunbathing on the coast even on the same day. In Ljubljana there is also probably the best student organization (\u0160OU) in the world that organizes activities from A-Z almost 24\/7.     The only thing you have to be afraid of in Ljubljana is falling in love! :)     Argyris Aris Antonacopoulos, Erasmus Exchange Student     Erasmus in Ljubljana was a unique experience in every aspect. Academic wise the school offers some interesting courses and I particularly appreciated that lectures enabled me to grasp a view on how business works in real life. I had the opportunity to make company visits and have lectures from people working in well-known companies. Whereas studies matter, let's move on to more fun stuff!     I chose Ljubljana because I wanted to visit the Balkans and it was great time! Being less than an hour from ski slopes was also a plus. The city is beautiful with lots of students so don't worry about meeting people and making new friends. The Student organization was really helpful first by helping with accommodation but also for arranging parties and events! As for the night life well there is only one word, ERASMUS!! (but I'll give you a hint: try Metelkova, Ultima or check for a dorm party). "

In particular, DNA gyrase introduces negative supercoils in DNA in front of the replication fork, while topoisomerase IV is important for decatenation during DNA replication. Thus, both enzymes are involved in very important processes during DNA replication and are essential for cell viability. Type II topoisomerase is also found in eukaryotic cells, but unlike the prokaryotic enzymes, eukaryotic topoisomerase II is homodimeric. This difference in structure makes selective targeting of prokaryotic topoisomerase II possible. The similarities in the structure of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV offer an exceptional opportunity for the dual targeting of these enzymes by new antibacterial compounds, thereby reducing the probability of bacteria to develop target-based resistance against them. Thus, the selectivity of targeting prokaryotic topoisomerase II, the potential of dual targeting, and the well-known structure of these enzymes make both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV attractive targets in the challenging search for new antibacterial compounds.     Design and synthesis of voltage-gated potassium and sodium channels     The abnormally increased activity of sodium channels leads to over-excitation of specific groups of cells which can cause different neurodegenerative diseases, chronic pain, epilepsy, arrhythmias and spasticity. A number of preclinical studies have implicated NaV1.3, NaV1.7, NaV1.8 and NaV1.9 in nociceptive processing and mutations in their genes were linked to spontaneous chronic pain. Mutations of NaV1.4 that result in hyperactive skeletal sodium channels have been shown to cause myotonia or flaccid paralysis, whereas mutations of NaV1.5 have profound effects on cardiac function, leading to a range of cardiac abnormalities. Owing to the extremely broad therapeutic potential of VGSC modulators, and to the recently disclosed first X-ray crystal structures of bacterial NaV channels, discovery of VGSC modulators has become attractive topics in medicinal chemistry. Although there are several drugs acting at NaV channels, e.g. local anesthetics (lidocaine, procaine), antiarrhythmics (lidocaine, tocainide, mexiletine) and antiepileptics (phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), a more rational approach is required to exploit the full therapeutic potential of these drug targets. Current drugs acting on NaV channels have low potency and are relatively non-selective, therefore there is a need for the development of isoform-selective modulators which offers the promise of significant advantage over current therapeutic agents.     Kv1.3 channels are members of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. The highest expression of Kv1.3 channels is found in T and B lymphocytes and in macrophages. Kv1.3 channels have important roles in the modulation of lymphocyte differentiation, proliferation, migration and apoptosis. Altered expression of Kv1.3 channels has been implicated in several types of tumours and cancers, including solid tumours and lymphomas. It has been demonstrated that selective Kv1.3 channel blockers, such as the scorpion peptide margatoxin, can have marked antiproliferative effects. Recently, small-molecule Kv1.3 blockers have been developed, such as Psora-4 and PAP-1 which are strong inducers of apoptosis in tumour cells. The aim is to develop new selective small-molecule modulators of Kv1.3 based on novel scaffolds, using drug-design methods with the aid of new homology models of human Kv1.3 channels.     Design and synthesis of Pregnane X receptor (PXR) modulators:     Pregnane X receptors (PXRs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily and orchestrate expression of a varied family of genes that are involved in uptake, metabolism and disposal of a number of endobiotics and xenobiotics. Additionally, human PXR triggers the stimulation of phase III efflux transporters of the ABC (i.e., ATP-binding cassette) superfamily, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance (MDR) protein (MRP). Its ability to initiate metabolism and efflux of various molecules, and its overexpression in breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, osteosarcoma, and endometrial cancers, makes PXR a promising target for fighting MDR in cancer treatments. For example, the PXR antagonist sulphoraphane increases the chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to irinotecan. This opens the way for the use of PXR antagonists to overcome MDR in cancer chemotherapies.

Rhodanine as a scaffold in drug discovery: a critical review of its biological activities and mechanisms of target modulation. Expert opinion on drug discovery, 2012, 7, 549-560.     TOXICOLOGY     Mechanisms of toxicity of endocrine disrupting chemicals (BPA analogs, novel brominated flame retardants)     In our laboratory we evaluate the influences of different metabolic reactions on the endocrine activity of endocrine disrupting chemicals such as BPA analogs and novel brominated flame retardants. Metabolism can change or even abolish the endocrine activity of a compound. In contrast, in some cases, metabolism enhances endocrine activity, as was previously described for the oxidative metabolites of BPA and bisphenol B (2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butane). Therefore, we study in-vitro metabolism of compounds by human liver microsomes (HLM), human intestine microsomes (HIM), and recombinant human CYP450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 to determine whether or not they generate oxidative metabolites in-vitro and to find out which is the major CYP450 enzyme responsible for these reactions. We determine the endocrine activities of compounds on estrogen, androgen, thyroid and glucocorticoid receptors using different cell lines. Since many of metabolites such as glucuronides are not commercially available, we can also perform enzyme-assisted synthesis of glucuronides, using HLMs as the enzyme source.

Detection and evaluation of reactive metabolites:     For the detection of reactive metabolites of different xenobiotics, we study compounds in human liver microsomes and with different CYP450 isozymes using reduced glutathione (GSH) as a trapping agent. GSH conjugates are detected by LC\u2013MS\/MS using three modes of scanning: a full scan, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and precursor ion scan (PIS) of m\/z = 272 with negative ionization. To investigate P450 oxidative reactions, incubations were treated with NADPH as a cofactor and GSH as a trapping agent. GSH usage was also preferred due to the fact that it does not inhibit P450s. This configuration represents a classical testing system that is widely employed in detection of reactive metabolites.     GRAMEC, Darja, PETERLIN-MA\u0160I\u010c, Lucija, SOLLNER DOLENC, Marija.

Po Prlekiji s starodobnimi kolesi     K\u00fcn\u0161tni Prleki so spoznali, da je staro kolo posebnost. Potovati z njim je nekaj neponovljivega. Res je vo\u017enja bolj po\u010dasna in nekoliko bolj je treba pritisniti na pedala, a ve\u010d veselja prinese ob\u010dutek, da so s tak\u0161nimi kolesi potovali \u017ee na\u0161i dedje - takrat je bilo za eno kolo treba prodati najmanj dobro kravo.     Na potepu po Prlekiji stara kolesa prevzamete pred muzejom dru\u0161tva Johanna Janeza Pucha v Ljutomeru. Vodeno si ogledate mestni park v Ljutomeru in pot nadaljujete proti vasi Mota, kjer dose\u017eete brod na reki Muri. Po malici, ki jo pripeljete s seboj, vas Tinekov brod popelje \u010dez Muro na prekmursko stran. Po povratku v Prlekijo po ravninskem delu nadaljujete do vasi Razkri\u017eje. Kova\u010d, ki ustvarja v stari kova\u010dnici, je va\u0161 naslednji gostitelj, in z njim spoznate zgodovino kova\u0161tva treh generacij. Doma\u010dini v prazgodovinski vasi pa vam prika\u017eejo na\u010din \u017eivljenja pred 5500 leti. Nadaljujete v smeri \u017deleznih Dveri. V Gresov\u0161\u010daku ob ribnikih degustirate ti\u0161ino. Preden vas pot povede med vinogradi na vinsko sleme, stopite \u0161e v posebno vinsko klet, kjer poskusite vino. Sledi \u0161e slab kilometer pe\u0161a\u010denja ob kolesu, ko prispete na doma\u010dijo Belec. V 350 let stari zidanici vas pri\u010daka kosilo iz kru\u0161ne pe\u010di.

We propose a multiple mediator model in which organizational factors, such as user participation and analytical decision making orientation, act as mediating mechanisms that transmit the positive effects of top management championship to advance a firm\u2019s BI capability. BI capability has two distinct aspects: information capability and BI system capability. Drawing on data collected from 486 firms from six different countries, we found support for the mediating effects of top management championship through user participation and analytical decision making orientation. These findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of how firms can develop BI capability. This study is one of the first to comprehensively investigate the antecedents of BI capability.

        "text":" Position of the Association of Journalists and Publicists (ZNP) regarding the official government dispatch on the state of affairs in the Slovenian media space and the assessment of the situation of the media in Slovenia     The official government letter of explanation about the state of affairs in the Slovenian media space, published on the Council of Europe's online Platform for Freedom of Expression 1in response to alarming reports of the present government\u2019s pressures on journalists - has provoked a strong backlash from dominant media and some policymakers. However, regardless of the political (in)appropriateness of such an approach of the government, the content of the government\u2019s dispatch is, according to an assessment of ZNP, accurate. It highlights certain key problems of the Slovenian media space to which ZNP has often warned in its reports.     One of the main problems of the Slovenian media space is the lack of pluralism. The media sphere is characterized by strong political unbalance since the majority of the journalists and editors more or less openly favor the political left option.     To understand the present media situation it is necessary to get familiar with the basic historical facts of the recent past which were empirically researched in at least two papers (Study of Media Freedom and Autonomy of the Media Space in the Republic of Slovenia in 2007, Media Freedom in Slovenia 2008).     It is a fact that in Slovenia the political forces which were in decision making positions in the times of Yugoslavia along with their ideological followers, (re)emerged after the Independence war and after the fall of the dictatorship from the previous Communist regime. It is not uncommon that the journalists, who were before 1991 formally in the service of the only authorized party - the Communist Party- during the previous undemocratic regime, became journalists, editors, and executives of many media after 1991. Some of them who took over were even agents of the former Yugoslavian secret police. The story of such a case was run in the Sunday Times in 2012.     Another specific of the Slovenian media space is that the left-wing political forces control most of the country's capital and therefore directly influence media policy, to which the public broadcaster RTV Slovenia is no exception. It has become increasingly evident that the dominant media have been following as closely as possible the political agenda of the left-wing parties and those that were in control in the previous undemocratic system.     There are practical examples of this trend. One common practice is the orchestrated dominant media launching of so-called \"new faces\", introduced by the left-wing political parties. Another is the uncritical willingness to support the interests of the left-wing political leaders, which is particularly outstanding in the Electoral confrontations. Topics discussed mostly follow the agenda-setting of the left-wing option. Another anomaly in the Slovene dominant media is the selection of guests on political TV and radio programs. The choice is in the strong disproportion between left and right-wing and independent political orientation of the guests.     It is a rather common practice that the editors from dominant media tend to harass or even dismiss journalists, including members of our association, who act autonomously and professionally. On the other hand, those who are committed to the mainstream agenda are rewarded and gain more influence, despite severe slips and they are often in risky positions prone to corruption. The dominant media, under the control of the political left, have been often (ab)used for battling their opponents using false or fake news, which is very well documented in Jan\u010di\u010d\u2019s book.     The profound lack of journalistic impartiality in the dominant media has become even more evident when in difficult times due to the outbreak of the COVID \u2013 19, the government of Mr. Janez Jan\u0161a took over. Much to our surprise the radical left-wing journalists along with the editors (including some of the most influential editors and journalists of national service RTV Slovenia ) frequently displayed their political views against the present government, mainly on the social networks and openly agitated against the new government. Least to say that such conduct is not very professional since we were in the middle of the government crisis (the previous has suddenly and quite unexpectedly stepped down) and health crisis.     The work of those journalists and editors has not been focused on informing the public and offering impartial information, but they prefer to use spinning and other means, such as amplifying small slips of the government's officials or exaggerating unimportant information. Unfortunately, their media agenda is directed against the government and not so much to disseminate important information in the present situation regarding the health and economic crisis.     The low professionalism of journalists and media producers in the dominant media has been mentioned already. Besides that, they are often highly politicized or even radicalized, many of them act as political activists or \/and ideological agitators, promoting a particular ideology or political agenda, usually from the left political spectrum, on the various social media. It is also rather often that so-called dominant media, including public service RTV Slovenia, often respond in an orchestrated manner to events that ally them to left ideology. In that manner , they strongly affect the citizens' perceptions of the political and social situation in Slovenia and their evaluation of the policies, political actors and other stakeholders. The orchestration of dominant media and the lack of media pluralism consequently project a distorted media picture to the broad public. In the mentioned context it is particularly problematic the biased attitude of the public media, RTV Slovenia, the national broadcaster, which activities are funded by all of the taxpayers, regardless of their political or worldview.     At the present moment, the broad public and the experts follow with the great interest strong polemics between the political actors who have been the victims of the dominant media lynch and the media workers that were actively involved. ZNP is not in favor of such polemics but emphasizes that to understand the media situation in Slovenia it is necessary to understand the historical events in Slovenia.     The media ownership, lack of pluralism and low professionalism are not the only causes of the biased media in Slovenia. The anomaly is also in the System. For example, the Ministry of Culture has paid no or scarce attention to supporting independent media or independent journalists. In the previous one-party regime the journalists were classified as political workers and the pluralism was not allowed or it was sanctioned. Therefore there was no independent media.     Still today the independent journalist and publicists are failing to register and obtain the status in the evidence of the Ministry of Culture, despite their politically independent and valuable contributions. On the other hand, the status which supports cultural, arts and creative workers are, for example, granted to cinema operators and puppet designer\/technologists, as they are listed in the register among with 61 professions. The present possibility of independent journalists to compete for media grants, unfortunately, does not eliminate the anomaly, but - conversely - reinforce the existing cartel situation.     The anomaly in the Slovene media space is a burning issue and to overcome the present situation several changes have to be introduced, but as expected most of them are not to the dominant media liking.     Aktualno     Stali\u0161\u010de ZNP o popravkih medijske zakonodaje     Stali\u0161\u010de in predlogi Zdru\u017eenja novinarjev in publicistov o treh predlogih novel, ki jih je v javno obravnavo dalo ministrstvo za kulturo.     Vabljeni k ogledu pogovorov s slovenskimi poslanci v Evropskem parlamentu, ki jih bo v \u017eivo prena\u0161al www.euportal.si. Pogovori bodo potekali v torek, 2. 2., med 15.30 in 17.30, in v sredo, 3. 2., med 17.00 in 18.30.     Gregor Knafeljc, stara zgodba     Mnogi novinarji glasno protestirajo, ker je novi odgovorni urednik tiskovni predstavnik podjetja brez ene same izku\u0161nje iz novinarstva. Seveda je to sprenevedanje. V slovenskem medijskem prostoru je bilo podobnih nastavitev s strani kapitala (beri: politike) \u017ee ni\u010d koliko. Tu izku\u0161nja manj ali ve\u010d ni pomenila prakti\u010dno ni\u010d. \u0160e ve\u010d, mnogi izku\u0161eni novinarji in uredniki, ki so postali odgovorni uredniki, so bili povsem nesposobni. Da je to res vidimo njihove rezultate - naklade in branosti so zaradi nesposobnega vodenja tako padle, da se nekateri mediji ne bodo nikoli ve\u010d pobrali. Mnogi zato \u017eivotarijo in odpu\u0161\u010dajo, nekateri pa bodo celo povsem propadli. "

        "text":" The monograph La religiosit\u00e0 popolare in Val Canale: Il teschio lavato e avvolto nel panno (Popular piety in the Canale Valley: The skull that is washed and wrapped in cloth) is re-writed and updated version of Slovenian monograph Ljudska religioznost v Kanalski dolini: O umiti in v prt zaviti lobanji (2014).     The book illustrates the festive year of Slovenes in the Canale Valley from the perspective of current ritualistic practices (still in use today). The identifying elements of the Slovenian linguistic community are recognizable in the implementation of various (popular) religious practices by the local population. The author presents the rituals (with selected prayer formulas), described as an integral part of their life by Slovenian-speaking informants - all of whom are indigenous, native people of the Canale Valley - that was described, from the point of view of experts in the fields (e.g. Kuret 1989) as typical of the Slovenian community in general.     There is a brief geographical and historical description of the Canale Valley, with an emphasis on the life and level of organization of the Slovenian linguistic community. The text focuses especially on the review of the history of teaching the Slovenian language as an important identifiable element of the local Slovenian linguistic community. The villages Ugovizza (slo. Ukve \/ nem. Uggowitz \/ fur. Ugovitse), Camporosso (slo. \u017dabnice \/ nem. Seifnitz \/ fur. Cjampros) and Valbruna (slo. Ov\u010dja vas \/ nem. Wolfsbach \/fur. Valbrune) are examined, which once had the largest native Slovenian-speaking population and where the ritual of washing and wrapping a skull in cloth was recorded.     Based on ethnographic research carried out to date (Mati\u010detov 1955: 231-254, Maister 1975: 238-247) and the data acquired through guided interviews conducted with local people from Ukve, Ov\u010dja vas in \u017dabnice in 1997, 2013 and 2015, the monograph continues with a comparative presentation of the ritualistic washing and wrapping of skulls in cloth, as it is described by the members of the local population. According to Mati\u010detov (1955: 231), it is \"a special custom that is performed among the Slovene population when bodies are exhumed and moved. It consists in cleaning the skull, wrapping it in a cloth and placing it back into the grave next to a new corpse.\" Records of the presence of such rituals in Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Macedonia are proof of the connection of this ritual washing and wrapping of skulls in cloth with the wider South Slavic area (Schneeweis 1935; Gasparini 1955; Mati\u010detov 1955; Maister 1975; Tolstaja 1999), while recent research (Kajkovski 2014) confirm that cult of the skull was worshipped by all neighboring South Slavic nations, as early as in the early Middle Ages.

Our work will include forecasting of long-term competence needs, identifying deficits in current and future competencies, and using and developing appropriate programs for upgrading and recruiting the necessary competencies.     Internationalization     Internationalization is divided into two main standpoints that are ultimately connected:     development-oriented internationalization: promotes partnerships in European projects, partnerships with other foreign companies, and cooperation and networking of Slovenian experts with experts or companies from other countries and\/or inclusion in international projects, and     foreign market oriented internationalization: promotes and provides Slovenian companies with assistance and research, when companies are looking to enter a new foreign market.     Information and communication technology (ICT)     In order to achieve higher competitiveness, we need to improve digitalization across all five action pillars. SRIP HRANA with its partners in different fields, including ICT, provides excellent foundation for implementation and improvement of ICT in the agri-food sector. As a challenge, we have recognized the lack of digital competencies, establishment and organisation of information databases and higher cyber security. In order to achieve this, we have joined a partnership ICT \u2013 horizontal network to work alongside with their members towards wider implementation of newest information and communication technologies.

        "text":" LIFE BioTHOP project addresses the challenge of developing a new cross-sector value chain to produce biodegradable, compostable and recyclable products with enhanced environmental sustainability and mechanical functionality. These new bioplastic products will compete with the fossil-based counterparts in terms of price by utilising low cost waste-derived hop fillers; in mechanical functionality, through the use of a composite approach; and in sustainability terms, through the vertical energy integration of mass site production pathways.     TECOS, a partner of the LIFE BioTHOP project, is pleased to announce that the first validation trial on the production of bioplastic planters has succeeded! The construction design of a new prototype mould was coupled with the numerical simulations of injection process, which has proven to be a successful method in the production of tools specially adapted for the processing of biopolymer materials. The first validation series was carried out on the production of bio planters made of pure PLA material, certified for its biodegradability under the industrial compositing environment. With this preliminary testing we were able to define a technological window of the processing conditions for injection moulding technology and to prepare the test bed environment for the introduction of new biocomposite materials, that are currently under the development stage in the frame of LIFE BioTHOP project. Once the optimized material formulation, based on PLA and wasted hop fibres, will be confirmed, we will start with the pilot line production of bioplastic planters on this prototype tool. The planting pots will be primarily applied for the cultivation of hop seedlings, though after the certified standards on biocompostability validation, these products will be suitable also for all related application fields in horticultural and agricultural industry.     In addition, we managed to include in this preliminary trial study another interesting project that is also a part of LIFE environmental program. It is a #LIFE Citruspack, under which the development of a variety of biocomposite materials is taking place, and are based on PLA bioplastic and citrus fibers, coming as by-products of citrus juice production. TECOS, which also acts as a partner in this project, has implemented the first replicative project on introducing the CitrusPLA materials in new sectoral products. To this end, we have produced a limited series of Citruspack planters and confirmed the potential for using these materials also in the horticultural and agricultural production sectors.     Plastics used in packaging accounts for 39.9% of the whole European plastic converter demand, that was equal to 51.2 Mt in 2018. Another sector in rise for the plastics demand is agriculture. Packaging is by far the largest contributor to plastic waste with a 63% (17.8 Mt) and agriculture is closely following with a 24% (6.5 Mt) contribution to the total collected plastic waste. So high percentages are the result of disposable plastic items with very short lifespan period.     European Parliament has recently posed an answer to this problem, by sweeping the ban on single-use plastics by 2021 in an effort to tackle the pollution in seas, fields and waterways. Due to negative pollution effects caused by fossil-based plastics and the length of time for which these materials remain in the natural environment, there is a very real and urgent need to find more sustainable alternatives. Bioplastics are a family of materials that offer advantages over traditional polymers, with a major role to play in the circular bio-economy. The market for bioplastics is growing at a fast pace (20% per annum); their production results in 60% less GHGs. The global plastics market currently produces over 359 Mt and bioplastics account for less than 1.5% of this market. "

But local people are proud to have such a magnificant waterfall so a very well path with the wooden stairs leads from the nearby village Nova vas. Waterfall could be accessed in any season of the year. It is not easy to measure the height of the waterfall \u0160um. It is type of the waterfall with the slide flow on the rock slope. Height is approximately 18 m (~64 feet) but it might be even higher.ACCESS:From the centre of Kranj to the waterfall \u0160um is only 8 km. Follow the local road from Kranj to Sp.Besnica and after 8 km is a village Nova vas. There is a waymark to the waterfall. A fine path with the wooden stairs leads to the bottom of the ravine.

        "text":" Leon Zuodar, The Noodle     22. 12. 2020 - 14. 03. 2021     Leon Zuodar: The Noodle#021, screen print on paper, 2020. Photo: Jaka Babnik.     Drawing, printmaking, painting, zines, animation and comics are the various media that Zuodar uses and masters with confidence. He is committed to the simple communication of content. Instant impact and humour. When he uses an \u201coutdated\u201d phone and social networks, he does not think about increasing the number of his subscribers and the potential influence and reach of his drawn animations. Nor does he care about a fascination for dusty technology. He merely incorporates their limited applicability into his work as a practical starting point, given the possibilities available today. In addition, he uses a random algorithm to select the cover image for each individual published \u201cNoodle\u201d and prints everything in silkscreen on felt, whose velvety surface increases the tactility of his drawing and softens the flatness of the artistic expression.     The exhibition is based on a series of short phone animations created by Leon Zuodar with a Samsung GT-C3350 called The Noodle between 2014 and 2015, in the period before the flood of smartphones and social networks. The first animations were produced during his travels through Europe, more precisely in Konstanz. Most of them were created during his residential stay in Berlin, and some of the last animations during his art residency in Rennes. He posted the interactive ha-ha-haiku animations on his YouTube channel and sent them by e-mail to a selected audience with the headline \u201cA noodle a day keeps the doctor away\u201d, a short, everyday, two-second dose of morning humour. After a good week, a colleague, who did not know who the sender was because the animations were from The Noodle, replied with a wish and a request: \u201cAs much as i like this short animations it's little bit too much for me to get one in my mail every day. Could you unsubscribe me? \u201d Among the many responses Zuodar received daily, this was an example of an extreme reaction to the quality and obvious spam-like nature of the messages. During the production of the animations, he kept various parts of the documentation such as drawings, collages and notations in a notebook, a kind of storyboard, or artist\u2019s book. This material was the starting point for reflection on the artistic potential of the purposefully conceived, low-quality humour based on poor sound and drawing quality, transmitted exclusively via a YouTube channel and e-mail, in a gallery context.     The poor quality of the animations and sound ties in with Zuodar\u2019s relationship to printmaking and photocopying, since it is precisely the aesthetics of the bad copies made with worn-out photocopiers that often serve as matrices for his prints. The exhibited works are thus randomly selected images from the low-quality Noodle animations, which are enlarged and photocopied, and finally printed using the silkscreen technique.     Drawing, printmaking, painting, zines, animation and comics are the various media that Zuodar uses and masters with confidence. He is committed to the simple communication of content. Instant impact and humour. When he uses an \u201coutdated\u201d phone and social networks, he does not think about increasing the number of his subscribers and the potential influence and reach of his drawn animations. Nor does he care about a fascination for dusty technology. He merely incorporates their limited applicability into his work as a practical starting point, given the possibilities available today. In addition, he uses a random algorithm to select the cover image for each individual published Noodle and prints everything in silkscreen on felt, whose velvety surface increases the tactility of his drawing and softens the flatness of the artistic expression.     The pleasure and love for making art, perseverance and patience, are easily recognised in his works. He has developed a recognisable pictorial language on a simply conceived drawing. This is succinct, without additional emphases, modelling and corrections, without caricatured additions, with serious and well-considered humour. It has a flat and childishly naive effect, which is precisely what makes it so narratively explicit. When we see it in a zine, it surprises us again and again. It has a clearly expressed point that can entertain us in various contexts with its content and sincere pictorial roguishness. Mostly these are simply drawn figures with just the right amount of additional artistic subtlety and feel for relevant and timeless themes. In some cases, they represent a good critique of the current situation within the field of creativity, fine art, economy of art, politics and nature. They are so simple and straightforward that we simply have to believe them.     With his multifaceted accessible and applied drawing, Zuodar is certainly one of the initiators of the new wave of drawing in Slovenia, which can be followed in the currently revived zine production, street art, alternative comic production and DIY animation. This type of production deliberately distances itself from the concepts of academic drawing. One might even say that he has helped to develop a trendy drawing style based on an effective narrative that deliberately questions the norms of high art, supported by the trash aesthetic offered by worn-out technology and broken photocopiers.

        "text":" Slovenians Lead in Identifying Bioterrorist Agents Through Next-Generation Sequencing     Bioterrorism is a threat to national and international security. Classic methods for determining and identifying such agents (e.g. culture assays, PCR) may be rapid and reliable, however, they are targeted and, as a rule, do not allow the identification of specific genetic changes responsible for the level of isolate virulence. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), it is possible to gain insight into the entire genetic material of the studied microorganisms or samples, allowing the species (strain) to be identified and genetic changes (e.g. a dedicated virulence record) to be determined.     The NGS method, however, presents a unique challenge due to the demanding bioinformatics processing of the large amount of sequenced data obtained.     With a view to reviewing the current state of countries\u2019 preparedness for the detection of bioterrorist agents using the NGS method \u2013 specifically, using for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) method - the United States organisation \u2018Secretary-General's Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical , Biological or Toxin Weapons' (UNSGM)\u2019, in collaboration with the 'Danish Technical University' (DTU), organised an inter-laboratory control in 2018. It invited numerous reference laboratories around the world to participate.     Since the Institute of Microbiology and Parasitology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine has a contract with the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Slovenia for providing professional advice and taking measures in the event of a biological weapons attack, the Laboratory for Molecular Bacteriology also participated in the aforementioned inter-laboratory control.     The aim of the inter-laboratory control was to identify microbial species, thus determining potential deliberate genetic changes (entering or deleting records for virulence factors) and assessing the laboratory's ability to assess biological risk. In a fictionalised (but realistic) scenario for inter-laboratory control, a suspected worker in a microbiology lab left 36 unmarked samples - potential bioterrorist agents. Their genomic sequences were available. What kind is it? Is this species a bioterrorist agent? Was the isolate in the sample genetically modified (GMO) by the suspect and thus affect its virulence?     The participating laboratories had to answer the above questions within one month of receiving the genomic sequences, based completely on their own ideas, and, in doing so, to use any bioinformatic tools and their own professional judgment for this purpose. The test involved public health, veterinary and general microbiology laboratories and laboratories specialising in biological defence. The participating institutions were located globally. Some countries collaborated with several laboratories. A total of 60 laboratories participated. The Institute of Microbiology and Parasitology at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, the University of Ljubljana (Bojan Papi\u0107, Darja Ku\u0161ar, Jana Avber\u0161ek) performed best among the participating laboratories, with a success rate of 94.3%. Laboratories from China, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, USA, France, Singapore, Belgium, Italy and Australia also performed well with success rates of 82.3% to 91.4%. Most of the participating institutions (44\/60) had less than an 80% success rate. The results show that Slovenia is very well prepared for the potential identification of bioterrorist agents using NGS. The overall poor performance of the participating institutions is also worrying and indicates the need to train staff in the field of bioterrorism and NGS bio-information processing.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Also, as an Amazon affiliate, we earn from qualifying purchases.     Pflueger is a company with a very long tradition in reel manufacturing, and that makes them very popular among anglers, including fishing beginners who are looking for an affordable but quality made entry level spinning reel.     One of their most popular reels is Pflueger President spinning reel, that comes in different sizes, and it is even available in combo with a rod.     After some testing, I decided to write this guide and share my experience with this reel, in order to help you make a decision, and answer any questions you may have.     In my opinion, this reel is quite good, and in the following chapters you may find all the PROS and CONS of it.     You can even choose among different models, and the other one available is Pflueger President XT, which has a bit different features.     So, no matter are you an experienced angler looking for a spare spinning reel, or you are just buying your first ever reel, Pflueger President could be the one.     Are Pflueger Spinning Reels Any Good?     This question is very hard to answer, because many anglers are brand loyal, and will praise the one they use while they will tell you that any other is bad.     In reality, you have to know what to expect. Pflueger President reel can be described as an entry-level model, suitable for beginners. Its performance is more that good when compared with similar reels made by other manufacturers.     Additionally, the reel is also quality made, if you consider its price range. Materials are good, all the parts work well and are manufactured properly. So, ...     The answer is YES, these reels are great when observed in their own category. Of course, if compared with high-end, insanely expensive models, of course that this one will seem inferior.     Also, Pflueger spinning reels are affordable, and that is also very important for many anglers. Their durability is high, especially if you will be using it on weekends only, and you know how to clean and maintain your reel.     These reels are smooth and there is almost no chance they will fail you if you use them right.     Where are Pflueger President Reels Made?     Pflueger company is based in the USA, and when they started manufacturing fishing reels, they were making them in the US.     However, as many other companies, they now manufacture their reels where the costs are lower, in China.     But, don\u2019t let that fact discourage you. Although not made in the USA, these reels are made by the US standard, and undergo all the quality control and tests as the would anywhere else.     The end result is a good product, for a lower price.     Unfortunately, that would not be possible if they were made in the US. Many people think that if something is produced in China it is bad. And that may be true for copies of certain items made with no control. But many reputable companies transferred their business there, simply to save money.     Pflueger President Spinning Reel [Review: What I Think?]     So, let\u2019s start with some technical details ...     Pflueger President spinning reel is available in 5 sizes, and those are 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40. This can cover many situations, and you can catch all kinds of fish species.     Graphite body is quite light. The 5.2 gear ratio is a medium one, and the reel can be used for many fishing techniques, which makes it great for beginners.     All sizes except 20 have 9+1 ball bearings, while size 20 has 6+1. And these bearings are made well, and the reel operates really smooth, which is surprising for this price range. They are made from stainless steel.     Line capacity is decent, and goes from 4\/100 lb\/yd mono line for the smallest model, to 10\/230 for the largest one.     The handle is made from aluminum, and the stainless-steel drag is corrosion resistant. Drag washers are sealed, which is a good feature. All sizes have front drag.     The spool is braid ready, so you can easily switch to braided lines if you wish to do so.     Maximum drag goes from 2.7 kg (6lb) for 20 size, to 6.3kg (14lb) for the 40 size. The lightest model weighs 0.17kg\/6.2oz, while the largest one weighs 0.32kg\/11.5oz.     As I already mentioned, the reel operates smoothly, with no twitching or jamming. Drag is also dependable, and overall, it is a very good product.     You can pair it with a suitable spinning rod, and get a really good setup for recreational angling or traveling.     Pflueger President Spinning Reel: PROS     So, there are plenty of good things that this reel has to offer, and these are the most important ones.     \u2022 Lightweight.     \u2022 Can be bought in combo with a rod.     Pflueger President Spinning Reel: CONS     Of course, everything has a downside too, so I will mention a few things I have noticed.     \u2022 Bail is a bit hard to flip, but this could get better with time and regular use of the reel.     \u2022 Has to be lubed\/greased a bit more frequently than some other reels.     \u2022 Setting the drag somewhere in the middle can be tricky, but when you set it, it works.     I don\u2019t think that these cons should stop you from trying out this reel (#ad). Within this price range, you will hardly find a reel that operates much better. It is very similar to some other good reels in this category.     Different Sizes of Pflueger President Reels [20, 30, 40]     As I already mentioned, the reel comes in 5 different sizes. These sizes should be enough for all kinds of recreational fishing.     Sizes 20 and 25 are small and lightweight, suitable for bream, trout, and all kinds of panfish.     30 size is great for walleyes and similar species, and it is in the middle of the available size range.     Sizes 35 and 40 are actually quite similar. They can be used for bass, catfish and pike, if you are not targeting extremely large specimens.     Differences in their weight and line capacity were mentioned in the previous chapter.     All of the sizes are available for both left and right-handed people.     Different Models of Pflueger President Reels [XT and Combo]     Pflueger President spinning combo (#ad) is a great choice for those who want to get a perfectly matched rod and a reel, without worrying about the rod choice.     Of course, you can choose among a few rod features. The length goes from 4,8 to 7 ft, and they vary from ultra-light to medium action.     All have stainless steel guides and a comfortable cork handle. Rods are 1-2 piece, with 5-8 line guides, depending on a length.     Of course, this rod and the Pflueger President reel are a perfect match, and if you are in a search for an affordable and quality performing combo, this is for you.     Besides Pflueger President combo, there is a Pflueger President XT reel (#ad), which has slightly different features.     Sizes available are the same, but sizes 30-40 have 6.2 gear ratio. Aluminum main shaft and pinion gear are well made, and the reel feels like an upgraded version of the regular President model.     The handle is made from carbon fiber. Drag, and line capacity are the same, but faster models have higher IPT, that is the biggest difference.     Also, due to an upgrade in terms of materials, this reel is slightly lighter. The smallest one weighs 0.15kg\/5.6 oz, while the largest one weighs 0.28kg\/10.1oz.     Pflueger President vs Shimano or Daiwa Spinning Reels     Daiwa is another great manufacturer and a very popular choice among anglers. Both are good, and it is a matter of personal preference and some slight differences between them.     When it comes to durability and how dependable they are, both of these fall into the same category.     Shimano also offers some excellent fishing reels on the market, and they are well known for their innovation and the use of different materials or production methods, to improve their reels.     Shimano reels are great, and if you are into the stuff like that, Shimano would be an obvious choice. Those reels are also dependable and durable.     No matter which one you choose, you will not go wrong. Pflueger is often underrated among different inexpensive reels, and there is no reason for that.     When it comes to casting, Shimano performs a bit better in my opinion, however, the difference is not very big. When it comes to retrieval, Pflueger President is a bit smoother.     Where You Can Use Pflueger President Spinning Reels?     Pflueger President spinning reels can be used in any pond, lake, and river. It is perfect for freshwater anglers, no matter the location.     Although some components are corrosion resistant and sealed, altogether the reel is not suitable for saltwater. Water and salt will find a way in and significantly shorten its lifespan, even if serviced regularly.     Of course, if you are not concerned about this, you can use it for inshore fishing, while targeting smaller saltwater fish species.     Conclusion     Pflueger President spinning reel is a good choice for anglers who are looking for an entry-level model. The reel is dependable, operates smoothly, it is durable, and it looks nice.     It comes at a reasonable price (#ad), and you will get a lot for it. It can be compared with similar models within the same price range on the market, however, it exceeds many of them in terms of smoothness.     If you are in a search of a reel with these characteristics, I would definitely recommend this model, and I am sure that you are going to be satisfied with it.

        "text":" The Koper-based Association for Culture and Education PiNA (KID PiNA) is certainly one of the most active and diversely oriented Slovenian NGOs. Always simultaneously involved in several artistic, educational and civil society projects, PiNA also manages a multimedia centre and a separate cybercafe\/event space. It has produced numerous research documents, booklets, documentaries and video manuals on everything from cultural management to human rights alongside an uncountable number of events.     PiNA's enterprises are mostly focused on the coastal region, yet also extend across the Slovene borders as many of its activities have a transnational dimension.     KID PiNA je neprofitna organizacija za dejavnosti na podro\u010dju umetnosti, izobra\u017eevanja in civilne dru\u017ebe. Stacionirana je na slovenski obali, v Kopru.     Contents     Background     Established in 1997 by the Open Society Institute, PiNA's stated objective fore-fronted strengthening the civil society and the development of public access to the modern tools of ICT. Thus, PiNA opened the first cybercafe in Slovenia (in 1998) and in 2004 joined with Ljudmila and Kibla to form the M3C Multimedia Centres Network of Slovenia, a Slovenian network of multimedia centres.     In the years that followed PiNA still maintained its multimedia and technological creed yet also started to venture more and more into other fields &ndsh; those of arts, cross-cultural dialogue, community-participation, sustainable development, the dissemination of info on the European Union and its projects, and so on.     Premises     PiNA manages two locations. One is a fully equipped multimedia centre for audio and video production and post-production. The featured Seed Sound Studio enables music recording and mixing. The centre is freely available for NGOs and individuals needing its services for non-profit intentions.     The second location, called eKavarna (\"eCafe\"), is fitted not only with computers but also with books and booklets on the topics of the European Union, sustainable development, informal education, and so on. It is used to host exhibitions, literary evenings, concerts, lectures, film screenings and the like \u2013 these are mostly produced by PiNA though the venue is open for outside productions as well.     Activities     PiNA engages in a broad range of activities. Culture-wise, it sets up exhibitions of comic illustrations, posters, multimedia works and photographs; screens films and documentaries, either as a part of its regular programme or featured as a part of particular projects; runs concerts (a series of them was produced in collaboration with the Cona Institute); and organises workshops on music production, film editing, etc.     These events are joined by more specific projects like photography exhibitions of villages burnt during WWII; an international conference on the historical treatment of woman involved in various sorts of resistance; round tables on the issues of discrimination in the theatre; workshops on oral histories (co-produced with the Science and Research Centre of Koper; and so on.     PiNA also organises training and mentoring for other NGOS, conferences, cultural management workshops, webinars, employment and therapeutic consultations, all manner of civil society development projects (urban gardening being one of the recent ones), and analysis (a resounding one was about the situation of youth in the coastal region, published in 2014).

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

        "text":" Marbled bread or ajdova budle     Apart from walnut potica, salty onion potica, ocvirkovca (savory potica with cracklings), zelj\u0161evka (savory potica with chive filling), and potica with a filling from dried fruit and honey, marbled buckwheat bread was also baked in the Cerkno region. Potica with a walnut filling often proved too expensive in the past, so it was mostly replaced by marbled bread on holidays, which was known as ajdova b\u00f9dle in the Cerkno region.     This bread, which had dough of different colors (wheat, buckwheat, and corn) to mimic the image of a festive potica, is known only to old people today. White risen dough would be kneaded for it exactly as for potica. The buckwheat flour was scalded separately. Risen yeast was added into the cooled flour. Risen white dough was rolled out and spread with a layer of dough made from buckwheat flour (ratio: 2\/3 white flour, 1\/3 buckwheat flour). Walnuts were sometimes added tothe buckwheat flour, maybe also walnuts and onions (the filling for the salty onion potica) for a tastier and saltier filling. The dough was rolled up as a potica.     B\u00f9dle in the shape of a round loaf was made at Christmas, but even more often for Easter. It is also known under the following names: the marbled potica or \u201cwhite vein\u201d. Instead of buckwheat dough, a layer of corn dough was sometimes wrapped into the white dough or both types were added.     Cracklings were added to the buckwheat flour. In this case the dough was made thinner, as for the traditional ring cake. This was also called ajdova budla or cast ocvirkovca (savory potica with cracklings). According to accounts there were many variants. We could say that each village had its own ajdova budle. In Zakri\u017e it was made with walnuts. In Labinje with a salty filling made from walnuts and onions. In Zakojca raisins were also added into the dough. We also cannot determine what the precise recipe should be, since the housewives measured the ingredients by feeling and depending on what kind of specific taste they wanted to create.     An interesting fact is that budle or budla is the name of many different dishes. In the Ba\u0161ka Grapa valley budla was a dish made of buckwheat and white flour, and minced lard. The buckwheat and white flour are mixed and the lard is melted. A thin dough is made out of flour, warm minced lard, salt, risen yeast, and warm milk or water, which can be poured into a baking plate. Once the dough rises, it is baked as bread (one hour). The housewives made it during the carnival season. In the Poso\u010dje area budle was the name for corn dumplings with raisins.     Ingredients     0,5 kg buckwheat flour     60 g yeast     onion, walnuts     Procedure     Scald the buckwheat flour. Once it cools, add risen yeast. Knead white risen dough. When the white dough has risen enough, roll it out. Then roll out the buckwheat dough on top and add the filling. The main ingredients of the filling in this case are the walnuts and the onion. Fry a large amount of onion in oil, but only until it turns a little yellow in color. Add the fried onion to the ground walnuts and mix everything well. Add pepper and salt. Roll it up as a potica and let it rise again.     Pi\u0161kotki     To spletno mesto uporablja pi\u0161kotke. Pi\u0161kotki se shranijo na napravo, s katero dostopate do spletnega mesta.

        "text":" CRP Service     Analysis of the regulation of service in civil proceedings in selected EU countries with an emphasis on the effectiveness of the method of service and the possibilities of electronic service.     DESCRIPTION     Within the research, different service systems will be examined in more detail. With legal comparative research analysis, we will analyze the different ways of service, with special attention being paid to identifying errors in service, their classification and the possibility of convalidation. The effectiveness of court proceedings is not measured only by their speed, but also by the effective protection of rights that clients have during the proceeding. The legal proceeding that is a subject of study is based on two sides with, in general, opposed interests. Therefore, an effective service system is essential for protecting the rights of both sides. An effective service system is one that provides correct service of documents to the addressee. Regarding this issue we will be addressing the fiction of service, which establishes a presumption of service, although the documents have not actually been served. This is particularly problematic when it comes to cross-border service, since the fiction of service does not meet the minimum procedural standards laid down by EU service regulations. We will try to determine how much the convention provisions on the protection of fundamental rights under the ECHR are incorporated into national procedural law on service. The existing arrangement will be analyzed from the aspect of constitutional legal protection, and the right to a fair trial and legal remedy as well as related convention rights and possibilities for amending the statutory arrangement.     We will point out the advantages provided by electronic service and do an analysis of the existing technical possibilities as well as a proposition for a more effective regulation of electronic service. We will compare the different electronic service systems with a distinction between open and closed service systems, we will also consider the European arrangement within the statutory validity of the eIDAS regulation (Regulation (EU) No 910\/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999\/93\/EC).     DURATION     1 November 2019 \u2013 31 October 2020     FINANCING     The Project is financed by the Research Agency of the Republic of Slovenia and the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Slovenia.

        "text":" The Holy Trinity Chapel, which protects the city, is positioned amongst the vineyards and, as a proud white guardian, looks silently upon Lendava below, with its green planes through which the Lendava stream meanders. Once there was a garrison stationed on this spot, which is strategically very important for the protection of the city.     Due to its strategic position not even the Turks in the 16th and 17th Century were able to invade this place. After the Turkish incursions and battles were over, grateful believers started to build churches and chapels at several sites.     The Holy Trinity Chapel was one of these that was built with similar intentions in 1727\/28. The construction costs were mainly covered by the Gludov\u00e1cz family, who were well-respected.     In the Chapel there is also a naturally mummified body, which has triggered the imagination of the people of Lendava since time immemorial. This mummy has been connected to many legends. According to local tradition, which is based on the fairytale stories from the first half of the 19th Century, there was a legend that in this Chapel rests Captain Mihael Hadik, one of the famous heroes from the battles against the Turks. It is presumed that he fought in a major battle with Turkish troops in 1603, when Lendava was defended by Krist\u00f3f B\u00e1nnfy. "

        "text":" Povzetek: Microwaves are very effective at wood pest eradication. However, elevated temperatures may pose a risk of damaging surface coatings used on cultural and historical artefacts. Therefore, we monitored changes in patterns of the original paint taken from such objects along with newly prepared coatings. We evaluated visual, mechanical, and chemical modifications of coatings when exposed to microwaves (750W, 2.4GHz), at 60\u00b0C or 80\u00b0C for 10 min. Whether old or new, only water-based coatings have proven to be resistant to elevated temperatures and no damage was observed at 80\u00b0C. Blisters have formed on layers of new oil paints and natural resins due to insufficiently cured film. Temperatures above 80\u00b0C may cause melting of coniferous wood resin and thus transport of resin to the surface; on the other hand, temperatures up to 60\u00b0C are completely harmless. Mechanical and chemical changes of coatings exposed to microwaves were not observed, but the studies showed that colour and gloss exhibited minor changes.

The research%s objective was to examine conditions for eradication of house longhorn beetle larvae (Hylotrupes bajulus) in spruce wood (Picea abies) using microwaves. Larvae, inserted at different depths of spruce blocks containing 12% and 42% of moisture, were exposed to microwaves. Two apparatuses were used; a 750W commercial microwave chamber and a newly developed horn antenna microwave device with the power of 800W and a frequency of 2.45GHz, for targeted radiation. We discovered that the inner part of wood warmed up quicker than the surface heated to 65\u00b0C. For successful suppression larvae in the wood need to be heated to 54.5\u00b0C, for 10 seconds. The necessary exposure time increases with increasing thickness of wood. The surface of wood containing more moisture is heated quicker, but increased moisture slows down the penetration of microwaves into the wood specimen. Therefore, larvae in wood of lower moisture (12%) died faster, both those 20mm under surface (1.5min) and those at 130 mm of depth (10.5min).

        "text":" History     Antiquity, ancient Romans, Atrans     In different historical periods, Trojane was always an important spot for ancient travellers on the road from the middle to the eastern part of Slovenia (looking at the borders as they are today). Ancient Romans who travelled from Emona (today's Ljubljana) to Celeia (today's Celje) and onwards to Petovia (today's Ptuj) established their army and post office there. They named it Atrans. The oldest known written record mentioning the present name of the place goes back to 1229. Coins with the images of Roman emperors` (Comodus, Domitian, Hadrian) are a small part of the rich archaeological findings in Trojane.     At the time of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, before the railway line Vienna - Zidani most - Ljubljana - Trieste was built, there was a well-used road. The road was named the \"Old Vienna road\" by the native people and it connected Celje via Trojane and \u00c8rni graben with Ljubljana and Trieste. Along that road, locals built a great number of two-storey carter houses, relatively large for that period, with a tavern on the ground floor, accommodation above, big stables for horses and warehouses for storage. Old written records from 1826 tell us that the owner of the majority of such carter buildings around Trojane was Toma\u009e Kotnik (an ancestor of the Konj\u009aek family).     The Konj\u009aek family, the first bus link     Among all the buildings in Trojane which still serve their original purpose today, there is one, proudly showing its construction year which goes back to 1849. The year is engraved in a stone plate and fixed above the main entrance. The building belongs in the treasury of national immovable heritage and has been placed under monument protection. Credit for such classification of this impressive building goes to the first members of the Konj\u009aek family. In the years between 1911 and 1913, the landlords formed a union, organised as a shareholders' company, and invested in the purchase of three buses (Zaurer brand) from Vienna in 1913. Among the shareholders was Franci Konj\u009aek, father of Gregor Konj\u009aek. In the same year, the first two buses began carrying passengers to Trojane. The company bought the buses to establish a connection between Ljubljana and Celje. One bus ran from Ljubljana to Celje, the other went from Celje to Ljubljana. Both buses met at Konj\u009aek`s in Trojane at 8-a.m. and continued their way after a short stop for refreshment and a snack for the passengers. In the afternoon, both buses returned. The third bus was just a reserve in case of problems with the other two. It is interesting to note that the bus journey on the macadam road between Ljubljana and Celje took three hours. The first two buses came to Trojane in the year 1913. In 1939, a boarding house was built in Trojane - the Konj\u009aek hostel. Beside the hostel there was also a petrol station for the buses and infrequent cars.     Recent history, the 1950's and the late 20th century     After World War II the People's Republic of Yugoslavia accomplished the nationalisation of all private properties. No one was spared, not even the Konj\u009aek family. They had to incorporate all their properties into the Trojane Agricultural Co-operative, just like other local farmers. In July 1959, the co-operative opened the restaurant \"pri Kon\u009aku\" and revived activity in Trojane. Rajka Konj\u009aek was in charge. At the beginning, there was only one employee working in the restaurant. The traffic became heavier and tourism began to develop, so the Trojane restaurant, with its special position, expanded quickly. In 1959, the road was finally tarmaced. Accommodation called 'rooms for foreigners' was built in 1959-60. By that time, there were 18 people working for the company. In October 1960, the catering industry was separated from the co-operative and began to work independently. That year was a special landmark in the company's history, as it is was considered to be the year of establishment of the company as it is today. Soon after, in 1961, the company started to produce the famous dessert 'Trojanski krof ' (Trojane doughnut), well known in Slovenia and most of Europe, just occasionally at first, but since 1962 on a regular basis. Finally, here is a short summary of the events in the last decade of the 20th century, which were important for the company. In 1992-93 the company's administration successfully accomplished negotiations on the denationalised property of the Konj\u009aek family. To the satisfaction of both sides, they agreed on a settlement and a pay-off . In 1994-96, the right of ownership was settled, and in September 1996 the company was registered as a shareholders' company.     Trojane doughnut     Our famous doughnuts deserve to be mentioned separately, because they also carry the name of Trojane across Slovenian borders.     Certifikat SQ     We pride ourselves on the SQ certificate - Slovenian Quality Product-for our own Trojane doughnut, of which we are very proud.     Ecology     In the restaurant company trojane a lot of attention is also devoted to obtaining green energy and use of green energy. "

Institute presented by Suzana Milevska, Tadej Poga\u010dar, Pia Covre, Daniela Mannu and Carla Corso (Comitato per i Diritti Civili delle Prostitute, Pordenone), supported by the Obalne galerije - Coastal Galleries,     Up to 2014 the gallery was the site of the Slovene Pavillion for both the Venice Art Biennial and the Venice Architecture Biennial. The gallery was managed by Obalne galerije - Coastal Galleries. In 2014 the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia decided to rent a biennial exhibition space in Arsenale. See below the archival article.     Archival article     The A plus A, Slovenian Exhibition Centre in Venice is a non-profit exhibition space established in 1997, as a centre for the promotion of contemporary Slovene and international art. Up to 2014 it served as a site of the Slovene Pavillion for both the Venice Art Biennial and the Venice Architecture Biennial. Since 2014 the Slovene artists have been presented at Arsenale.     The gallery operates year-round to host temporary solo and group exhibitions of mostly Slovene artists. It has established a network of contacts between civic and foreign institutions and organises round tables, performances and video projections, thus offering a panoramic view of today's artistic expression and a point of meeting, exchange and critical dialogue.     Background     The A+A Gallery first opened its doors in 1992 in Madrid, inside a space divided by a corridor (hence the name A plus A) restored by architect Boris Podrecca. After five years of activities co-ordinated by Lidija \u0160ircelj, the gallery moved to Venice, near Palazzo Grassi.     Venice Art Biennial participation     In 2015 JA\u0160A presents UTTER \/ The violent necessity for the embodied presence of hope, curated by Michele Drascek and Aurora Fonda.     Jasmina Cibic's project entitled For our Economy and Culture, curated by Tev\u017e Logar and produced by the City Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana in cooperation with the \u0160kuc Gallery, was selected to represent Slovenia at the 55th Venice Biennial in 2013. The exhibition is accompanied by the conference.     Sculptor Mirko Bratu\u0161a represented Slovenia at the 54th Venice Biennial in 2011 with the project dubbed Hot Emotion Heaters. At the A+A Gallery the two-metre-high clay figures called Hypocrites (previouosly shown at the Bo\u017eidar Jakac Gallery, Kostanjevica na Krki) were exhibited in the lower gallery grounds, while new, smaller statues were displayed in the upper room, and linked to the Venice environment and the biennial's concept ILLUMInazioni.     At the 53rd Venice Art Biennial in 2009, Miha \u0160trukelj's project x=0 \/ y=0: Interferences in Process. He examined the issue of perception in five equal segments: notes on a board, drawings, works on tracing paper, Lego-pictures and paintings as the final segment. This work was further based on researching the mechanism of perception, which \u0160trukelj analyses with the aid of traditional representational media \u2013 painting and drawing \u2013 but so as to include critical examination of the act of perception and the act of painting as committed existential acts of the contemporary subject.     At the 52nd Venice Art Biennial in 2007 Tobias Putrih featured in two-parts the project Venetian, Atmospheric. The first part of the installation, exhibited inside the gallery, included several maquettes, drawings, photographs, and sculptures which explored and questioned the relationship between architectural space and the scale models which precede it. The second, main part of the project was set up in a garden on the Island of San Servolo and consisted of a full-scale pavillion, a movie theatre.     Ten years after Russian-born artist Vadim Fi\u0161kin represented Russia in 1995 at the Venice Biennial, Fi\u0161kin's project Another Speedy Day was presented in the Slovene Pavillion at the 51st edition of the biennial. After forging professional and personal bonds in Slovenia he has become considered as a Slovene artist whose presence in Ljubljana contributes significantly to expanding the field of contemporary art in Slovenia.     Venice Architecture Biennial presentations     In 2014 the project The Problem of Space Travel - Supre: Architecture by the Cultural Centre of European Space Technologies (KSEVT), in 2012 the 100 YC (Maribor - 100 Year City) and in 2010 the All Shades of Green project by Studio AKKA and Studiobotas were presented at the Venice Bienniale of Architecture, supported by the Ministry of Culture at A plus A Gallery in Venice.     In 2008 the project Ljubljana \u2013 Venice: Urgent Need for New Urban Policy presented an architectural and urban comparison of the two cities, Ljubljana and Venice. On the 2006 Architecture Biennial Slovene participation was designed as a cabinet of ambient environments and icons entitled Formula New Ljubljana created by the SADAR + VUGA Architects in A+A Gallery and other locations in Venice.     Some other exhibitions     In 2008 A plus A gallery presented the exhibition The Partisans in Print: Slovenian Partisan Press & Graphic Art since 1941, curated by Donovan Pavlinec, featuring previously unpublished material in Italy: Slovene Partisan press, incisions, xylography, wartime banknotes and bills of exchange with reproductions of the patriotic activists designed by Slovenian artists and architects. Organised in co-operation with the International Centre of Graphic Arts in Ljubljana, in collaboration with the Slovenia's National Museum of Contemporary History, the exhibition and the accompanying catalogue offered a rare opportunity for scholars and members of the public to peruse visual testimony of social and political engagement at a critical moment in history.     Culture.si offers information on Slovene cultural producers, venues, festivals and support services, all in one place. It encourages international cultural exchange in the fields of arts, culture and heritage. The portal and its content is owned and funded by the Ministry of Culture and developed by Ljudmila Art and Science Laboratory. "

        "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Analysis of compensation of banks and savings banks for payment services - 2017     02\/15\/2018 \/ Press release     The Bank of Slovenia has once again drawn up its annual Analysis of fees charged by banks and savings banks for payment services, and calculation of the costs of payment service baskets (hereinafter: the analysis), for the ninth consecutive year, covering 12 banks and three savings banks.     The analysis allows payment service users (individual consumers and legal entities) to compare the fees that they are charged for specific payment services by payment service providers, and the calculated costs of payment service baskets (on an annual basis), thereby making it simpler to choose the most suitable or cheapest payment service providers (with regard to their payment habits and the size of their payments). By publishing the fees, the Bank of Slovenia aims to help payment service users in making an informed decision in choosing a payment service provider, but it cannot directly influence the level of fees (this is the domain of the individual payment service providers).     Of the total of 21 payment service segments analysed, the average fees as at 31 December 2017 were up on 31 December 2016 in 12 segments, down in six segments, and unchanged in three segments. The largest increase (of 28.57%) was recorded by the average fee for external payments by standing order for individual consumers, which can at least be partly attributed to the redirection of payment service users to a more cost-effective alternative (e.g. direct debits), while there was a decline (of 3.85%) in the average fee for managing a current account for individual consumers.     Payment service users can also compare payment service providers on the basis of the costs that the particular provider would charge for providing payment services. The annual charge differs with regard to the payment service provider\u2019s business methods, i.e. whether the client uses a bank teller for payment (a traditional client) or electronic banking (an e-client).     Costs of payment service baskets of cheapest and most expensive payment service providers     By 31 October 2018 Slovenian payment service users (individual consumers) will also be able to compare (certain) fees at the EU level, through the creation of comparison websites in Member States (in Slovenia: at the Bank of Slovenia), in accordance with the Directive on the comparability of fees related to payment accounts, payment account switching and access to payment accounts with basic features, which was transposed into Slovenian law by the new Payment Services and Systems Act. The improved transparency of fees at the EU level will make it easier for payment service users to choose between more than 4,000 payment service providers in the EU, irrespective of country of origin.

Dr. Irena Marinko: INTERCULTURAL COMPETENCIES FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION     Abstract     World, its economy, government and the majority of other sectors are getting more and more internationalized.     This means increased communication, sharing of information and experiences among different areas. The economy and government have become intertwined and co-dependent although there are many cultural differences and barriers especially in Europe with its different languages and histories of individual nations and tradition. The article Intercultural Competences for Public Administration intends to describe the increasing international activities of the public administration in Slovenia, and suggest new courses needed for international education of civil servants. The findings of the research indicate that employees in public administration should be acquainted with courses like characteristics and business behaviour of different European countries, international communication, creative business writing, relaxed conversation in a foreign language, international business, sustainable management, etc. Such courses can help students acquire the necessary skills for work in the period of globalization and increase cooperation among European nations.     Key words: Public administration, tertiary education, intercultural competencies     Introduction     The article Intercultural Competences for Public Administration intends to describe the increasing international activities of the public administration in Slovenia, and suggest new courses and themes needed for international education of civil servants.     The Republic of Slovenia has always been in close contact with other nations. In the last centuries Slovenia was under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, under France, during the Second World War it was divided between Germany, Italy and Hungary and in the 19th century a part of the ex-Yugoslavia. Slovenia became independent in 1991 and joined the European Union in 2004.     The rate of internationalization of the Slovene economy, measured by the average export and import share of GDP was up to 2009 relatively high. Slovene business companies have had plans to further increase export and import activities but the financial crisis stopped the growth in 2010. The most frequently used international operations in Slovenia are importing, direct exports, export through an intermediary and contracts (Ruzzier, Antoncic, Hisrich, 2007), sole venture direct investments, while there are not so many licensing, joint venture direct investments and franchising. Slovene SMEs make on average between 20% and 30% of their sales from international operations and sell about one-quarter of their products or services to foreign markets. Companies and employees are more or less efficient in doing this, but on average the employees of Slovene SMEs dedicate less than 25% of their time to international operations.     However, economy with its export, import and other activities represents only one part of international processes taking place in Slovenia. No detailed analysis has been made about the internationalization of public administration so far but it is obvious that almost all public administration institutions are in one or another way involved in the processes of internationalization.     President of the Republic of Slovenia with his staff, Office of the Prime Minister, different ministries (especially Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Public Administration, Ministry of Finance) as well as governmental offices (Government Office for Development and European Affairs, Office for Local Self-Government and Regional Policy, Government Office for Slovenians Abroad, Government Communication Office, Protocol of the Republic of Slovenia, Office for National Minorities) cooperate in numerous international projects, arrangements, and economic activities. They exchange visits and share experiences, cooperate with foreign firms in Slovenia and help Slovene firms abroad, try to motivate more extensive import, export, cultural and other exchanges. People employed in the contemporary public administration have to study and bring into Slovenia foreign experiences. Quite a number of public servants take part in the creation of EU policies, contribute to the promotion of Slovenia in EU member states and other target countries, publish information about Slovenia, and participate in international conferences. Also Slovene communes started to develop international links. Some cooperate in European projects, make closer contacts with foreign communes because they cooperate in the field of economy, send their representatives abroad to study development of one or another economic activity.     In the last years there have been several reports in the newspapers about how local and state administrations adapt successful foreign practices and other organizations of social infrastructure. Tax Administration of the Republic of Slovenia found a useful tax practice in Netherlands and will try to adapt it to Slovenia. Slovene local administrations think about increasing international connections with the neighbouring countries and try to contribute to sustainable development by cooperation in European programmes etc. (Bertoncelj Popit, 2010).     These tendencies of internationalization show that economy with its import and export activities is no more the only sector that has to do with internationalization. In fact, it is a question where there is more internationalization, in public administration and\/or government or in business firms. Therefore we should not speak only about international business or international economic activities but also \u2013 or perhaps even more \u2013 about international public administration activities and about the necessity to introduce new intercultural competencies also in the education of civil servants and not only in business.     The paper first describes the international activities in Slovene public administration and tasks of the employees, quotes a literature review on intercultural competencies, and lists suggestions for new necessary courses and themes that will acquaint students with intercultural competencies.     The findings of the research will help to answer the questions:     - Is public administration getting so internationalized that employees should be acquainted with intercultural competences?     - Which courses should be introduced in BA programmes of the future civil servants to develop their intercultural competencies?     International Activities in Slovene Government and\/or Public Administration     This chapter gives a short summary of international activities that take place in Slovene public administration daily as it can be seen on the web pages of the government, in newspapers and on TV.     The National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia cooperates with international parliamentary institutions and international organizations, has its delegations in international parliamentary institutions, cooperates with other parliaments through parliamentary friendship groups, its members participate in international conferences, receive foreign representatives to discuss matters of common interest, visit foreign countries to learn foreign experiences etc. (Republic of Slovenia, National Assembly, 2011).     Slovene president and his staff are strongly involved in international activities because the President receives all the most important foreign visitors, participates in the international meetings, addresses international conferences, visits foreign countries, gives interviews. Similarly, the Prime Minister accepts many foreign guests and performs visits abroad.     Slovenia\u2019s presidency of the Council of the European Union, Regional partnership, Chairmanship of the Council of Europe etc. extended international activities of Slovene public administration.     Slovenia participates in a number of international organizations: European Public Administration Network, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Network of School of Public Administration in Central and Eastern Europe, and in several fields of e-government (Slovenia, 2011).     Among the most internationalized parts of Slovene public administration is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs especially because of the following areas of work:     - Preparation and formulation of positions, work within international organizations, conventions, forums and bilateral joint committees etc.     - Assistance in arranging international visits and events     - Coordination in preparing positions, responses and statements in legislative procedures     - Cooperation between the Ministry and Slovenia\u2019s Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels     - Participation in preparing materials for Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Councils for the Slovenian Transport Minister     Monitoring of project implementation co-financed by the EU.     Also other ministries are going international, e.g. Slovene Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning (the presidency of the Alpine Convention), Slovene Ministry of Culture (elaboration of proposals of cultural policy measures, promotion of Slovenian culture and achievements of Slovene artists on international level), Slovene Ministry of Health (international meetings, e.g. within the framework of Eurotransplant International Foundation).     Even Slovene communes in spite of being local administrative units are increasing their international work. Communes situated in the vicinity of the border have partnerships with similar administrative institutions across the border, cooperate in common projects, exchange visits, share knowledge and experiences and acquire new knowledge. Some communes founded centers for international cooperation in EU to perform research activities, international meetings, cultural exchange and participate in different working groups. A number of international competitions and other arrangements are organized in different communes (Obcina Gornja Radgona, 2011).     The internationalization means searching data bases, agents, representatives, sending off brochures and information to prospects, discussing possible representation, corresponding in English and other foreign languages, arranging for legal registration abroad, talking to local accounting and consulting firms. In an international area it is necessary to communicate by e-mail, mobile phones, text-messaging, video- and Web-conferencing as well as by international travel and face-to-face meetings.Employees in public administration accept and inform foreign visitors, receive, transfer, answer phone calls, accept and reply letters and e-messages, write and explain reports, analyses, articles, cooperate in public relations and different marketing activities, accept, classify, and process documents in foreign languages, have to complete and control transport, export- and import documents, design and write letters and other documents in foreign languages, enter documents in evidences, manage lists and evidences, archive documents, study foreign laws and rules, control international tenders, issue confirmations and certificates, prepare agreements, gather data about the possibility of education and training abroad, participate in EU and other projects, organize international meetings and conferences, prepare documents for meetings, organize accommodation and travel of foreign guests, organize international travel and so on.     All these tasks require in front of all a good command of at least one or preferably more foreign languages because they have to communicate both orally as well as in writing.     International activities require special sensitivity and comprehension. When making contacts with other cultures, e.g. at international trade shows, seeking for suppliers, exporters, importers, joint-venture partners, embassy officials, chambers of commerce, trade associations and consultants, one has to be prepared to overcome stereotypes, differences and prejudices. Generalizations and categories are necessary, but when they are too rigid they can be a barrier to the effective interpretation of a situation (Gibson, 2008, 12). This is especially important when discussing prices, payment terms, specifications, quality, quantity, and all the other issues involved in international business.     The most competitive Slovene companies in the future will be those that will produce and sell on international markets (Ferk, 2010). Globalization requires from management quick and continuous adaptation to foreign cultures. The same is required from management in public administration and government.     Literature survey on intercultural competencies     For a long time it was believed that internationalization will introduce a common international culture, most probably the one of Western countries but it is obvious that we are still far from universal cultural solutions (Hofstede, 2001, Jandt, 2004).     The concept of being intercultural is challenging and not always comfortable. Being intercultural involves questioning the taken-for-granted conventions within which one lives, seeking to empathise with the experience of others, reflecting on the impact of this upon oneself and one\u2019s own identities. Those who work in international area should be aware that people are uncomfortable to do business with complete strangers, especially if it seems that these have different values and habits. An intercultural approach does not mean abandoning one\u2019s own value positions but it means recognising the importance of understanding and negotiation (Alred, Byram, Fleming, 2006).     Members of one culture can, by the force of imaginative insight, understand the values, the ideals, the form of life of another culture or society, even those remote in time or space. They may find these values unacceptable, but if they open their minds sufficiently they can grasp how one might be a full human being, with whom one could communicate, and at the same time live in the light of values widely different from one\u2019s own.     Byram recommends (Alred, Byram, Fleming, 2006, 121) that employees in international organizations should be educated how to grasp and take seriously the opinions and arguments of others, recognize those who have different opinions, be able to put oneself in the position of others, accept criticism and listen. They should make their own opinions (needs, interests, feelings, values) clear, speak coherently, and explain clearly. Every kind of violence, humiliation, insult etc. should be abandoned. People should take account of those who are weaker, reduce discrimination, integrate outsiders. It is necessary to organise group work, cooperate in the distribution of work, take on tasks, trustworthiness, perseverance, care and conscientiousness. In the global world people should tolerate plurality, divergences, differences, recognise conflicts, as far as possible create balance, and resolve problems in socially acceptable ways, accept mistakes and differences, find compromises, seek consensus, accept majority decisions, tolerate minorities, promote encouragement, balance rights and responsibilities, and show trust and courage. Group responsibility, development of fair norms and common interests and needs should be emphasized and common approaches to tasks pursued.     Slovenia still falls short of these recommendations because of its strong emphasis on national identity and with little indication of any elements of education for intercultural citizenship. While large enterprises are increasingly involved in cross-border operations and have been acquainted (at least to a certain degree) with cultural differences among their and foreign countries, the globalization process presents challenges and opportunities especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the public administration. Organizations that want to do business efficiently in a global environment should take into account language, religion, values and attitudes, education, social organization, technology and material culture, the political environment, and the legal environment (Jazbec, 2007).     Himmelmann says that words and terms have a certain meaning and sense in every language (Alred, Byram, Fleming, 2006, 69). Terms are embedded in a certain culture. They emerge from that culture. They are modes of communication and ways of thinking in that culture. They symbolise certain contents and provoke certain connotations for those who are used to the words and terms in question. A model for intercultural competence proposes an integration of linguistic\/communicative objectives with intercultural competence objectives.     Of key importance in international firms is knowledge of foreign languages to a degree which enables not only basic expressions but a relaxed conversation and understanding that there are differences in the same language spoken in different countries. Language barriers, adjustments to different cultural and linguistic environment can be observed as shyness, language, social and personal uncertainties, fear of failure and communication problems. There should be information about what to do when different cultures fail to understand one another, either for language, behavioural, or cultural reasons. Foreign languages in Slovenia have long been taught under the supposition that it is most important to know grammatical rules and that one should speak without mistakes (Marinko, 2010). This contributed to serious problems in relaxed conversation and higher education institutions must engage their students and professors in critical and creative reflections and discourse and not hold onto past practices (Riznar, 2010).     Several authors recommend that employees who work in international environment should be acquainted with intercultural competences such as knowledge, tolerance, flexibility, awareness of one\u2019s own cultural identity, openness for new experiences, considering opinions, ability to adapt to values of other people, ethical behaviour, patience, interpersonal skills, empathy, sense of humour (Van Eyken et. al., 2005).     A survey of courses taught at Slovenian colleges and faculties for public administration shows that students who will become civil servants develop knowledge in the areas of law, administration, constitution, IT, economics, organization, management, EU, and on some colleges also politics, policies, international relations, history, psychology, communication, democracy, human rights, and voting system. Foreign languages are not always considered as core subjects and in the best case they represent about 5 % of pedagogical hours. Slovene BA study programmes for public administration\/political sciences do not offer enough foreign languages and lack courses in the area of intercultural cooperation. If the students do not acquire their intercultural skills through additional education, they will not be able to contribute to better understanding of differences among different nations in the globalized world.     Suggestions for new courses containing intercultural competences     The demarcation between the public and private sectors is blurred. Laws, regulations, tax policies, contracts, grants and loans require an interaction between the two sectors so that even in the private sector an understanding of public administration and government is critical (Cleveland State University, 2011).     In the past ten years a number of world\u2019s changes have contributed to significant changes of the public administration which requires new skills, attitudes and behaviour among public officials at all levels. The core competencies for the public sector in the 21st century differ in many ways from the past. The skills, knowledge and competencies are increasing and becoming more complex (United Nations, 2005).     To ensure compliance with the normative framework, reduce the level of conflict, guarantee peaceful co-existence, make contemporary government and\/or public administration into an example of dialogue between cultures, the employees in public administration should be acquainted with some basic intercultural competences.     Foreign languages are among the most important intercultural competencies. Foreign languages express different cultures and give the possibility to understand different cultures. Students who speak more foreign languages can communicate with several countries. Knowledge of foreign languages opens the door to other cultures and can improve intercultural understanding in Europe and with the rest of the world. Different documents of the EU emphasize the importance of languages and there are many actions and projects that support knowledge of foreign languages. Therefore the first condition of the new study programmes for government\/public administration is knowledge of foreign languages. Foreign languages should be taught at least to the level B 2 CEF.     There should be more courses\/themes on European citizenship and participations; students should expand the world view through understanding and respect of different cultures and with other contemporary aspects of intercultural communication and international cooperation. The courses should help acquire knowledge about characteristics and habits of different European countries, international communication, different beliefs, practices, rituals, ceremonies of particular groups of people, sustainable management etc. The study programmes should include courses\/themes on behaviour, values, communication style, conflict-solving-techniques etc.     Public administration should also be acquainted with ethnic minorities in their countries. Cities are environments where immigrants are confronted with discrimination and racism (Sprung, 2004).     There are some university programmes that already contain suitable courses which acquaint students with intercultural competencies and these should be included in public administration studies:     Ethics in public administration     Cross-cultural and ethical dimensions of international management     International relations in international communities     Managing in the international arena     International protection of minorities etc.     Conclusions     Slovene leading economists, governmental and educational institutions are convincing business firms and other organizations that they should increase their international contacts and enlarge their possibilities in the global world. In the future we can expect much more export, import, joint-ventures, global marketing etc. which means communication with most different cultures in different languages. However, not only business but also government and\/or public administration are going international. The most different services and bodies from the President of the Republic of Slovenia to the communes exchange visits and share experiences, cooperate in international projects and agreements, participate in international conferences and intend to increase international contacts. Therefore it is necessary that also future civil servants develop their knowledge of one or more foreign languages and that they are acquainted with intercultural competencies such as tolerance, flexibility, awareness of one\u2019s own cultural identity, openness for new experiences, considering opinions, ability to adapt to values of other people, ethical behaviour, patience, interpersonal skills, empathy and so on.     Our study programmes which educate students for work in the public administration and\/or government should offer more foreign languages and courses which would develop intercultural competencies. The paper lists some courses that should be included in the curriculums of future civil servants. However, it will be necessary to create also more new courses and thus contribute to intercultural knowledge. "

The title comes from the soon-to-be-published book by Slovenian dance teacher Marija Vogelnik, which epitomizes the essence of contemporary dance creativity by stressing that every movement can itself be dance and that we do not have the body, do not possess the body, but rather we are the body. Body and dance are indelibly linked. Becoming aware of the body, feeling the body and oneself through creation and expression by movement is an important yet neglected part of the education process. This is why the conference aims at fostering links between the art of dance and education, thus linking those active in the area of general education with those who enrich a child's free time with dance.     Lectures and workshops at the conference are aimed at kindergarten, primary and secondary school teachers, professional dancers and choreographers, dance teachers, dance therapists, students of art and education faculties, theoreticians and researchers from the fields of pedagogy, psychology etc. The conference will allow the participants to actively acquaint themselves with topics from the fields of dance pedagogy and creative movement. The conference will also host a mini festival of children dance groups entitled \u201cPIKA MIGA\u201d (PIPPI MOVES).     PRESENTERS:     Susan Griss (US), Author of Minds in Motion: A Kinesthetic Approach to Teaching Elementary Curriculum (Heinemann, 1998); a pioneer in the field of arts-in-education     Franca Zagatti (IT), Professor of Educational Dance at the University (2000 \u2013 2014), free-lance dance artist and Artistic Director of Mousik\u00e9     Pol Coussement (BE), artistic director of Passerelle, cultural educational organization that helps children and young people to develop through dance, movement, expression and performance     Sanja Tropp Fr\u00fchwald and VRUM performing arts collective (CRO)     Prof. dr.

Conference participants are invited to write an example of good practice (presented can be a lesson, project learning approach ...) and send their contributions by 1 July at the address nina.mesko@jskd.si.

''(since 0.11)''     50     You can safely edit any of the tickets and continue to navigate through the results using the ''!Next\/Previous\/Back to Report'' links after saving your results, but when you return to the report, there will be no hint about what has changed, as would happen if you were navigating a list of tickets obtained from a query (see TracQuery#NavigatingTickets). ''(since 0.11)''     Export the report as plain text, each row on its own line, columns separated by a single comma (',').     58     '''Note:''' Carriage returns, line feeds, and commas are stripped from column data to preserve the CSV structure.     59     '''Note:''' The output is fully escaped so carriage returns, line feeds, and commas will be preserved in the output.

Each group will have its own header and table.     182     * '''`__color__`''' -- Should be a numeric value ranging from 1 to 5 to select a pre-defined row color. Typically used to color rows by issue priority.     183     * '''`__group__`''' \u2014 Group results based on values in this column. Each group will have its own header and table.     184     * '''`__grouplink__`''' \u2014 Make the header of each group a link to the specified URL. The URL is taken from the first row of each group.     185     * '''`__color__`''' \u2014 Should be a numeric value ranging from 1 to 5 to select a pre-defined row color. Typically used to color rows by issue priority.     '''Example:''' ''List active tickets, grouped by milestone, colored by priority''     196     * '''`__style__`''' \u2014 A custom CSS style expression to use for the current row.     197     198     '''Example:''' ''List active tickets, grouped by milestone, group header linked to milestone page, colored by priority''     also possible to create multi-line report entries.     214     218     215     * '''`column_`''' -- ''Break row after this''.

Dnevni red:     16:00 -- 17:00     Jozsef Bekesi     Title: Assignment Model for Real-World Vehicle Scheduling Problem with Refueling     Abstract:     Vehicle scheduling problem consists of scheduling a fleet of vehicles to cover a set of tasks at minimum cost. The tasks are given by prescribed time intervals and vehicles are supplied by different depots. The problem is to minimize the number of vehicles used. There are several mathematical models for this problem. The most widely used ones are when the problem is formulated as an integer multi-commodity network flow model. In this model the optimal schedule is computed by solving a linear integer programming problem. The disadvantage of this model that it is not easy to handle specific restrictions coming from real-word applications, for example vehicle refueling requirements. In this paper we present a model for this variant of the problem combined with vehicle assigment. This model also leads to an integer programming problem. We present our expereriences and results on the application of these techniques to the real life problem given by the Szeged local bus company.     17:00 -- 18:00     Mary Servatius     Title: Isomorphic Cayley Graphs on Nonisomorphic Groups     Abstract:     We will show when it is possible for two Cayley Graphs on different abelian groups of prime power order to be isomorphic.

At first you need to follow direction Maribor - no matter where you come from. In case you're comming from direction Dravograd you will see a sign for Ruse after the village Selnica and that's where you need to turn right. After a while you will cross the river Drava and you will get to the sharp left turn uphill. When you get to the top you will immediatelly see the railway station to your right. A few houses forward on your left you will see our premises with a wide asphalt road towards the house and a parking space in front. If you're comming from Austria, Ljubljana or from Italy you first need to follow direction Maribor. When you get to Maribor follow direction Dravograd. Depending on which side of the river Drava you are you will se a sign for village Ruse or a sign directing you to the left for Ruse. In case you came to Ruse through Limbus, Bistrica ob Dravi, Bezena you will see a sign for the start of village Ruse and a PETROL station on your right-hand side across the crossing. Turn right here! Drive straight toward Tovarna dusika Ruse and when you cross the railway turn to your left. You need to drive for around 600m and you will come to the next crossing. Here just drive ahead (watch for cars from the left) and you will see our house on your right after app. 100 meters. In case you get lost just ask someone about Osterversnik or Selniska cesta and they will know. "

Abstract: Chronic or recurrent pain in childhood is a common phenomenon, which psychologists encounter in their work within a multidisciplinary care team. In this article, we try to shed some light on the theoretical background and practical guidelines when dealing with chronic pain in children and adolescents. To understand chronic pain properly, biological\/physiological, cognitive, emotional, behavioural and social factors need to be taken into consideration. In the first part of the article, we try to summarize the results of recent studies on the connection between these factors and the development of chronic pain. We highlight the theory of understanding and treating chronic pain in children and adolescents based on cognitive-behavioural theory. The second part of the article deals with the methods of cognitive-behavioural therapy for assessing and monitoring pain, psychoeducation, and specific cognitive and behavioural techniques in a systematic and practical fashion.     Keywords: chronic pain, children and adolescents, cognitive-behavioural therapy     Cite: Stropnik, S., & Krko\u010d, V. (2020).

Induviduals or groups experience the therapy in the cabinets of occupational therapy (Snoezeln, Hubbard or pool), and in the concrete narrow and broader living environment by integrating functional orthotic and orthopedic devices, and by adjusting the distance. Occupational therapist takes into account the importance of team work, cooperates with other practitioners to maximize the achievement of common results. Individual treatment and the NDT techniques, carried out by occupational therapists with Bobath certificate, in the field of sensorimotorics results in better posture tone and movement, as well as in improved posture and arm functions in users. Users gain new sensual motorical experience, pathological patterns and stereotypes are reduced. In the sensory, perceptual and cognitive field the use of a variety of materials, shapes, weight and hardness reduce sensory deficits, attention and concentration improve, as well as the functions of memory, thinking and perception.     Computer work as a therapeutic activity is very diverse. Users are able to offer a large range of stimuli, through which they gain new experiences and through them establish a better level of cognitive function, motor function, self-esteem, self-confidence, cognitive training and perception training. The computer as a therapeutic medium represents an ideal job and increasing autonomy in daily activities and management of the environment. Daily activities are an important area in occupational therapy. By choosing the proper position during eating, adapted utensils, surroundings and accessories for eating, and properly prepared food, we achieve greater independence and a notion of food culture. The proper encouragement, praise and motivation, a suitable atmosphere during activity are reflected positively in everyday life, the participants gain self-confidence, self-esteem, and maintain maximum independence in personal appearance; they take care of their close living environment, while integration into the broader environment is easier and better.     Group therapies are divided according to their content into creative, employment, movement, music, sensory-stimulation and socialization groups. Participants are also included in households, trips and outings in the narrower and broader living environment, and participate in a variety of festivities and celebrations. Group work in occupational therapy is aimed at integrating people into the various contents of everyday life. The correct choice of group work, analysis and adjustment, as well as invitation to activities are important. The form of working in groups is adopted by various groups that give substance to a resident's daily life and at the same time bring external life to the Institute. The residents are included in groups by invitation, upon their wish, first as observers, and later as active members.     By integration into different groups, there is interaction between individuals, attention and concentration are improved, and there is the possibility of their own choice, acquisition of new knowledge and skills, the ability to socialize and socially interact between each other. Integration in the narrower and broader living environment is an integral part of the comprehensive care of residents in occupational therapy, which is faced with predictable and unpredictable situations, where residents meet new people and respond to them. Occupational therapist learns about participants in different areas of activities, he or she learns about their willingness to work with others and to adapt their behaviour to the society, in which they may have different roles. New environment affects their behavior, they must adapt to it - the same way as they affect the environment. All activities within the framework of integration are aimed at participants and their environment, they are individualized and tailored to the level of mental development, desires and needs, and require certain skills from the participants.     We also carry out occupational therapy through therapeutic dogs, where dogs with a specific characteristic are the cornerstone of care for the user and equal participant in the process. Its purpose is to improve the physical, social, emotional and cognitive functioning of individuals, we have also observed a very strong motivational element. It makes it possible to influence several functional objectives at the same time, which is a big advantage, it contributes to the maintenance, preservation or acquisition of the skills needed for the functioning of individuals, moreover, what is particulary important is the contact with the animal and the development of ties of friendship between man and animal. A therapeutic pair consists of a dog and his handler and occupational therapist with additional training.

        "text":" The volume Histori\u010dni seminar 14 ('Historical Seminar 14'), issued in the time of transformed reality of what we knew and took for granted, draws attention to the fact that the image we cultivate of ourselves and our history may sometimes be too simplified to be entirely real. At first, the volume both revises already known chapters of Church history and introduces hitherto unknown ones. Simon Malmenvall\u2019s analysis of the characters of the noble martyrs Boris and Gleb, Jovan Vladimir, and Magnus Erlendsson shows how the stories of their martyrdom had a nation-building function. Celeste McNamara\u2019s article on Giovanni Barbarigo introduces the unusual and less well-known topic of seventeenth-century missions. Monika De\u017eelak Trojar analyzes in detail Johann Ludwig Sch\u00f6nleben\u2019s German and Latin Lenten sermons. Ale\u0161 Maver\u2019s article discusses why Latin disappeared so quickly from Slovenian churches after the Second Vatican Council. On the other hand, the pre-modern religious practices of nature worshippers in Slovenia are discussed by Cirila Toplak. Modern times and also more political issues are examined by Toma\u017e Ive\u0161i\u0107 who focuses on the increase in ethnic tensions in Yugoslavia in the early 1970s, while Aleksandar Takovski traces the historical representation of heroic figures in four former Yugoslav countries.

        "text":" Opis: People have travelled and migrated since the early periods of history and the phenomenon of migration, defined as \u201cthe movement of large numbers of people, birds or animals from one place to another\u201d (Oxford Advanced Dictionary, 7th ed.) has a history of hundreds of years (Pourjafari, Vahidpour, 2014) and is by no means new. But the way of travelling, migrating and mobility in contemporary reality does have many specific aspects and recently it has been studied in new ways, with new concerns. The experience of migration in the contemporary world is a fundamental characteristic of human societies. \u201cIt is a system in which the circulation of people, sources and information follows multiple paths. The energy and barriers that alter the course or deflect the contemporary patterns of movement have both obvious and hidden features. While nothing is utterly random, the consequences of change are often far from predictable\u201d (Papastergiadis, 2000: 1). This unpredictability and multidirectionality has led to changes in approaches to the study of migration in recent decades. In the last few decades the study of migration has increasingly been accompanied by a tendency to study it on the individual level \u2212 at the level of personal life stories (Milhar\u010di\u010d Hladnik, 2007). These are also markedly expressed in the medium of literature. The present dissertation presents literary oeuvres of seven women writers, who thematise the autobiographical experience of migration, it offers an individually, woman-centred experience and view of migration. In selected oeuvres personal views are expressed on that experience, different strategies of coping with life in new realities and regarding relationships in these environments. The thematisation of the experience of migration in selected oeuvres is also connected with a problematisation of other concepts: the concepts of belonging, borders, nation-state, culture and language. It is also vitally connected with the personal identity construction of the lyrical subjects and literary characters and also because of the autobiographical character of selected literary works of the literary artists themselves. The experience of migration in selected literary works leads to unique identity formations, which in themselves combine elements of different cultural backgrounds and traditions. In their literary works these selected women writers also shape their relationship toward time and space dimensions, tradition and interpersonal relationships through the experience of migration. The experience of migration, the relocation of the subject and a change of the geographical area in selected oeuvres, does not only represent a change of the geographical position: it also allows a deviation from other rigid and seemingly fixed and unvarying patterns and virtual realities that accompany human life. Migration can also present an alienation effect from traditionalisms and determinants that define human lives. In the literary oeuvres of these selected women writers, migration is only in part tied to the traditional concepts related to migrants, with the loss of roots and rupture with the place of origin. In the selected literary oeuvres, migrants are rarely considered to be uprooted and unable to find their anchor or confidently start a new chapter in their lives in a new environment. Migration is mostly connected with the possibility of expanding the horizon of insights and perspectives of looking at life, with the acceptance of its complexities, ambiguities and incompleteness. Mostly, the experience of migration is seen as a new, creative option, which opens and examines the wide range of other issues and dilemmas. The condition of uprooted loss has traditionally negative connotations, but in the selected oeuvres vagueness and fluidity allow a real insight into the real, complex nature of life and human existence.

It explains in which cultural spaces she worked and how she established personal contacts with artists. Zofka Kveder worked in a multidirectional way, as she promoted Slovene culture in the new cultural environments she moved into, and acquainted the Slovene cultural space with the achievements of foreign artists. She was also a mediator of ideas: feminism, Yugoslavism, and ideas about coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures. Zofka Kveder's translation oeuvre is very rich and almost unexplored so far, which opens up possibilities for new research.

        "text":" Digital transformation and freedom \"for\"     29.8.2017     Digital technology already provides extraordinary ways of connecting. Cooperation at personal level, within organisations or between organisations has been freed from old, clumsy and time-consuming operations. Thinking about the future of digital, technologically advanced world, freed from the old patterns of connecting and cooperation, I see a parallel with the concept of freedom \"from\" and freedom \"for\".     In very simplified terms, freedom \"from\" denotes being free from restrictions forced on an individual by others. The history is full of fights and revolutions in the name of liberation from such restrictions. Freedom \"from\" is an extremely important achievement, but can itself be a destructive force if it is not upgraded by freedom \"for\", with creativity and positive use of this liberty in order to live up to all our potentials. This requires true connection with others, which goes beyond the surface links of a conventional social relationship and well-established interactions, and leads to an entirely new form of connection with the whole world and self-realisation.     In practice, an increasing number of organisations recognise the positive effects of digital transformation on business results and on the relations and ways of cooperation within the organisation and outside it. There is an increasing number of those who accepted this technologically enabled freedom \"from\" the old patterns. However, what is important is the next step \u2013 realisation of freedom \"for\". What will be do with this new option for connecting?     If the present ways of cooperation are merely left to the inertia of technological progress, we can still reap the crops sown by digital transformation, but we cannot exploit all the potentials offered to us. I see the true creative potential of digital progress in a responsible setting up of a new system of cooperation, which will democratically include everybody, not only the rich and developed.

        "text":" President Pahor at the Prespa Forum: \u201cDuring its presidency, Slovenia will work sincerely to resolve the Bulgarian blockade on North Macedonia\u201d     Ohrid, 2. 7. 2021 | press release     President of the Republic of Slovenia, Borut Pahor, attended the Prespa Forum Dialogue taking place in Ohrid, North Macedonia. The Prespa Forum is held under the auspices of the President of the Republic of North Macedonia, Stevo Pendarovski, who invited President Pahor as a special speaker. This marks the start of Slovenian President Borut Pahor\u2019s international activities as the president of the state that took up the Presidency of the Council of the EU yesterday. During its presidency, Slovenia wants to achieve a breakthrough and start EU negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia and to accelerate EU enlargement into the Western Balkans.     Photo: UPRS The President participated in a discussion entitled Western Balkans: the Missing Puzzle for Completing Europe. The President emphasised the importance of the enlargement of the European Union and the further enlargement of NATO, which is crucial to the stability and prosperity of the neighbouring region of the Western Balkans. He pointed out that EU enlargement to the Western Balkan countries was a primary geopolitical issue and that the region should be seen as a whole. In Mr Pahor\u2019s opinion, it would be best for the EU to adapt its enlargement strategy to this issue and that the EU's absorption capacity was sufficient even in the event of rapid enlargement. Another increasingly important factor for enlargement is time, as a slow enlargement process is undermining confidence in Europe's future. At the same time, a faster EU enlargement to the Western Balkans would be a rebuttal to dangerous ideas about changing borders, which certainly could not happen peacefully, so the President of Slovenia \u201ccompletely rejects\u201d such ideas. The President added that the rapid integration of the Western Balkan countries into the EU would significantly strengthen the territorial integrity of these countries and the security of the region and Europe as a whole. \u201cWithout the Western Balkans, the European Union remains an unfinished peace project,\u201d said Mr Pahor, recalling that in mid-May he hosted a summit of the Brdo-Brijuni Process initiative leaders and although the session was very difficult, it ended in a general agreement on the main goals. The President went on to emphasise the importance of partnership with the United States and said that the transatlantic alliance had a good understanding of the geopolitics of the Western Balkans. He pointed out the importance of NATO membership for Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia. President Pahor concluded by saying that, in his opinion, the delay in negotiations with North Macedonia was unreasonable; what is more, it is politically wrong, undermining the EU's authority. He said that although he could not speak on behalf of the Government, Slovenia would work to achieve a breakthrough in the start of EU negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia and to accelerate the enlargement of the EU to the Western Balkans. The President of Slovenia also announced that he would attend the summit of the Three Seas Initiative in the following week and hold a bilateral meeting with the President of Bulgaria, Rumen Radev. After the panel discussion of leaders, President Pahor had a bilateral meeting with the host, the President of the Republic of North Macedonia, Stevo Pendarovski.

        "text":" Abstract: The Taylor-phase complex intermetallic compound T-Al3Mn, its solid solutions with Pd and Fe, T-Al3(Mn,Pd) and T-Al3(Mn,Fe), and the related decagonal d-Al-Mn-Fe quasicrystal belong to the class of magnetically frustrated spin systems that exhibit rich out-of-equilibrium spin dynamics in the nonergodic phase below the spin-freezing temperature Tf. Performing large variety of magnetic experiments as a function of temperature, magnetic field, aging time tw, and different thermal histories, we investigated broken-ergodicity phenomena of (i) a difference in the field-cooled and zero-field-cooled susceptibilities, (ii) the frequencydependent freezing temperature, Tf, (iii) hysteresis and remanence, (iv) ultraslow decay of the thermoremanent magnetization, (v) the memory effect (a state of the spin system reached upon isothermal aging can be retrieved after a negative temperature cycle), and (vi) \u201crejuvenation\u201d (small positive temperature cycle within the nonergodic phase erases the effect of previous aging). We show that the phenomena involving isothermal aging periods (the memory effect, rejuvenation, and the ultraslow decay of the thermoremanent magnetization) get simple explanation by considering that during aging under steady external conditions, localized spin regions quasiequilibrate into more stable configurations, so that higher thermal energy is needed to destroy these regions by spin flipping, as compared to the thermal energy required to reverse a frustrated spin in a disordered spin-glass configuration that forms in the case of no aging. Common to all the investigated brokenergodicity phenomena is the slow approach of a magnetically frustrated spin system toward a global equilibrium, which can never be reached on accessible experimental time scales due to macroscopic equilibration times.     Abstract: The synthesis, structural characterization, and magnetic properties of crystalline manganese oxide nanoparticles are presented. The procedure is based on the reaction of benzyl alcohol with the two precursors: potassium permanganate KMnO4 and manganese(II) acetylacetonate Mn(acac)2. Depending on the precursor used, the composition of the final product can be varied in such a way that in the case of KMnO4 mainly Mn3O4 is formed, whereas Mn(acac)2 leads predominantly to MnO. Rietveld refinement of the XRD powder patterns, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were employed for the structural characterization of the as-synthesized compounds. Especially the MnO manganosite nanocrystals exhibit some interesting features. HRTEM investigations point to the formation of a superstructure, which can be described as an ordered Mn vacancy cubic superstructure with the general formula of Mn0.875Ox and a lattice parameter of 8.888 A. The SQUID measurement proves a superparamagnetic behavior of the MnO nanoparticles.     Abstract: We report on the very peculiar magnetic properties of an ensemble of very weakly coupled lithium-doped MoS2 nanotubes. The magnetic susceptibility chi of the system is nearly 3 orders of magnitude greater than in typical Pauli metals, yet there is no evidence for any instability which would alleviate this highly frustrated state. Instead, the material exhibits peculiar paramagnetic stability down to very low temperatures, with no evidence of a quantum critical point as T --> 0 in spite of clear evidence for strongly correlated electron behavior. The exceptionally weak intertube interactions appear to lead to a realization of a near-ideal one-dimensional state in which fluctuations prevent the system from reordering magnetically or structurally.

        "text":" Super Video CD     The Super Video CD (SVCD) standard upgrades the Video-CD (VCD) format. It allows better video and audio quality, including extensions for surround sound, multi-channel audio and provisioning for PC playback. It's based on variable bit rate (VBR) MPEG-2 coding for more efficient use of optical disc capacity.     1. Super-VCD standard     The Super Video-CD is based on the CD-ROM XA disc format. All tracks are data tracks, the first track is a special DATA track with data retrieval information and interactive playback MPEG sequences. The MPEG-2 streams are recorded in the following tracks and are intended to be played sequentially starting from track #2. A movie could have different coded parts: INTRO, COPYRIGHT, FILM, CREDITS; each stored on a separate track. The film itself can be stored on one track with the possibility to be subdivided into chapters within the one track. The layout will be handle by an SVCD Authoring software like I-Author.     The DATA track ( #1 ) uses Mode 2, Form 1 data sectors ( 2,048 bytes ) and MPEG files use Mode 2, Form 2 MPEG sectors ( 2,324 bytes ).     The Super Video-CD 1.0 features ( IEC 62107 standard ) are given in the table below:     Still picture (photo) resolution NTSC resolution PAL     MPEG-2 ( I Frame ) 480x480, 704x480 480x576, 704x576     Audio sampling bit rate audio channels surround sound     MPEG-1 layer II 44.1 KHz from 32 to 384 Kbps up to 2 stereo or 4 mono MPEG-2 ( 5+1 ) extension     Overlay graphics and text sub-channels coding     overlay video plane <=4 4 color CLUT ( 2bits\/pixel )     The Program Stream contains two audio streams, usually for two separate languages. Audio streams are MPEG-1 audio formats, given in the table below:     The interlaced nature of the video signal is preserved. This results in smoother-looking motion for video footage that was originally shot with a field-based video camera.     The typical running time of an SVCD disc (with full resolution and quality) is about 35-45 minutes, although it can be extended to over 70 minutes by compromising image and sound quality.     For PC playback, the format allows storing applications or setup files in the EXT directory. The main root can even contain autorun enabling files.     An SVCD detailed technical explanation is available from Philips licensing page and a copy is also available from our documentation at sl00811.zip (86.5KB) in Acrobat PDF format. Jukka Aho has published a very good Super Video CD Overview.     2. Super-VCD players     SVCD can be played on PC platforms with a CD-ROM (or DVD-ROM) drive and appropriate software like WinDVD and STHSVCD (also named STHSDVD sometimes).     In general, people want to play Super-VCD on a TV-set with a standalone DVD player. Most DVD players sold in Asia can read SVCD but in America and in Europe only a few players are SVCD compliant.     Because some identical DVD player platforms are used all over the world, one can sometimes upgrade it's firmware and hack the player to make it read SVCD. One example is given at Leon's Lab for the Philips DVD-950 shipped in Europe.     3. XSVCD format     You may see or hear about an extension of the SVCD format called XSVCD. Because SVCD uses the MPEG-2 decoder of the PC, or the standalone DVD player, XSVCD tries to get the maximum from the decoder:     Higher resolution up to DVD resolution at 720x480 for NTSC (720x576 for PAL)     Higher bit rate up to 9.8Mbps (DVD bit rate) for standalone or 15Mbps for PC (MP@ML constraint)     For example, the Philips DVD-950 (with firmware 7.12) can play XSVCD at 720x576 and 2.9Mbps .

        "text":" Seminar iz kriptografije - 29. okt. 1998     Ogledali smo si naslednji film:     Computers, Spies And Private Lives     DESCRIPTION: SUBJECT: Computer Science, Sociology, Technology SERIES: Nova PRODUCTION COMPANY: WGBH PRODUCTION DATE: 1981 COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: United States of America ORIGINAL LANGUAGE: English PRODUCTION CREDITS: Commentary: James Whitmore Direction: Linda Harrar Direction: Theodore Bogosian Production: Donna Rice Production: John Mansfield Script: Linda Harrar Script: Theodore Bogosian     SUMMARY: This film examines the effects that widespread computer use is having on the most fundamental of all civil rights, privacy. The issue is becoming more crucial as computers go into mass distribution, as they have in France. There, terminals in every household and the use of a \"smart\" card, with which people do banking, shopping etc. and which contains private and health information, will revolutionize our way of life. But as soon as such information is handed over, it can be abused. Many credit bureaus have incorrect information which may adversely affect many lives.     In 1974, the United States passed the Privacy Act, which allowed citizens the right to search all their records and change incorrect information. Nevertheless, some people were refused access to their records. FBI investigations which included bugging, wiretapping, and threats have come to light. With the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the activities of the National Security Agency, any communications can be surveyed, and diplomatic codes broken. Since computer information goes out over telephone lines, it can easily be tapped as well.     The sale of mailing lists has become a large industry. Magazines and other organizations sell their mailing lists, much to the benefit of political organizations. Without the use of mailing lists and computer direct mail systems, the New Right in the United States would never have achieved the clout it did, according to one of its spokesmen. Similar to this are telephone broadcasting systems either selling products or collecting payments. These have a psychological power over a client, as she or he is committed to tape. Terrorist groups such as France's Direct Action fear this tendency and aim to destroy computers altogether.     With large datacentres, such as those used in banks, security becomes a major problem. Information can be tapped at many sources, particularly by people inside the organization. Citibank uses a system of codes and double-checking, but Amerifirst is the only American bank to use an encryption system, which scrambles transmissions. These are encrypted and decrypted using DES mathematical algorithms and two keys.     College systems are prone to computer vandalism as well. A young student explains to officials at a university how he deduced their access code, obtained their assembly programs, and had the capability to bring their system down altogether.     The single-key encryption system and the more manageable two-key system which has cyphers and supercyphers are explained. An official of the NSA explains that the agency is trying to limit cryptographic studies which might improve computer security and privacy as they threatened national security. The film concludes that the protection of privacy is extremely important in the computer age. "

Missa Exaudi Deus & Magnificat secundi toni Selected Works from the Hren Choirbooks 2     The edition presents two double-choir liturgical compositions from the turn of the sixteenth century by Lambert de Sayve, a Franco-Flemish musician active in the Habsburg lands: a Missa Exaudi Deus and a Magnificat secundi toni. Sayve\u2019s Mass is based on Giovanni Gabrieli\u2019s seven-part motet Exaudi Deus. Conversely, the Magnificat is not based on any pre-existent music. It evidences the evolution in taste towards greater colour contrast and word-painting. Considering the time and place of origin of the choirbook where his Missa Exaudi Deus and Magnificat secundi toni are preserved (Ljubljana, National and Univerity Library, MS 343) and the fact that the latter is the only extant Magnificat by him, these two compositions may well have been the ones mentioned in a written record, dating from 1604, that mentions Sayve\u2019s dedication of a new Mass and Magnificat to Archduke Ferdinand II. The quality of the two works presented in this edition demonstrates, one hopes, that Sayve\u2019s descent into obscurity is undeserved and that there is a need for a sustained scholarly investigation of Sayve\u2019s entire oeuvre.

        "text":" Kostel is situated on the south-western Slovenian border, by the River Kolpa, which is not only the line of separation between the Slovenian and Croatian languages, but also the political border between the former Carinthia and Croatia. The border goes from Grlj to Srobotnik, then up the slopes of the western edge of the Stru\u017enica forest, across the meadows between Dolenja Briga and Jesenov vrt, past Ajbel and Kapitol, to Ograjska gmajna, along the edge of Zdihovska stena, over the 695-metre peak of Jelovica, along the ridge above the River Kolpa and finishes at Grgelj. The area is sparsely populated, mostly covered with thick deciduous forests, characterised by the karst plateaus and numerous sinkholes, and peaks from 550 to 901 metres high (Kapi\u010d\u008d). Kostel was named after Costel, the castle and the settlement of the same name, which was first mentioned in 1336. The castle, which was built on a hill above the Kolpa, had several names: Castell, Khostl, Kostel (castellum = fortress or refuge), and Graffenwarth, the German version of the name meaning \u201cthe earl\u00c2\u00b4s guard\u201d. Kostel, with its scarce land, could not feed all its inhabitants, so they had to find other sources of income. The essential means were providing transport and peddlery. Travelling broadened the horizons of the Kostel peddlers. The Kostel customs, habits, songs, costumes and the language were developed and shaped on a geographically and historically limited territory. Their dialect has been formed by an indigenous population mixing with immigrants from Croatia and German neighbours. The process of the creation of this particular language began in the 16th century. The unspoilt Kostel countryside, with its flora and fauna, is a well-known and unique pearl. Of its natural beauties, the Kolpa should be mentioned, as it is one of the cleanest rivers in Slovenia. Not far from Fara, near the main road, it is possible to see the beautiful waterfall Ne\u017eica. Stru\u017enica is a typical karst plateau, with many sinkholes and peaks reaching 550 to 900 metres above sea level. The Ku\u017eelj wall, with a \u201cnatural window\u201d, rises above the settlement bearing the same name. The castle is a popular sight with visitors since it offers a wonderful view of the Kolpa valley. The entire complex of the castle is nearly as big as the one in Celje (which is the biggest in Slovenia), and the only one that combines the castle and the still living settlement below it. The Kolpa is suitable for fishing and other sports activities, especially rafting, kayaking or canoeing. Hunting tourism is also on the rise. And we should not forget to mention that ecological farming is developing in the area. "

New website: http:\/\/au.ung.si\/en     Objave z oznako \"Peter Mi\u0161i\u010d\"     With the morning ritual firmly establish (jog+ swim), we began a new day. This morning I went with the film crew on a scouting expedition to the small island where the short film will be shot, and when I say small, I really mean it. You can cross it in a few long strides if you want. Before heading back to Komi\u017ea, the boat (250 horsepower, 50 miles per hour, yippee ki yay cowboy) took us to a wild beach where we gathered firewood necessary for the filming, where each of us could have gotten themselves replacement footwear and towels, even a beach umbrella.     Well, we survived the windows ordeal without too much harm done, and we even got a place that might have internet (if we manage to get the password to the wireless). After having moved all the equipment to the Galerija (double locked doors ahoy) we sat down and had the formal introductory session, with everyone speaking in turns and all that jazz. "

Lidija Tu\u0161ek Koro\u0161ec     Partnerski stisk rok ob zagonu projekta.     Partners:     Regional Development Agency Me\u0111imurje - REDEA doo, HR, www.redea.hr (Lead Partner),     Objectives: Creating a supportive environment for the promotion of economic growth and the competitiveness of the economy by linking businesses and scientific-research institutions in a less developed cross-border area with the aim of creating a common economic space.     The purpose of the project is to stimulate the innovative activity of companies in a less developed border area. Taking into account the global trends and the overall presence of the crisis, it becomes clear that the long-term and sustainable development of the Podravsko-Pomurje region is possible only through increased innovation - this means introducing new ideas and technologies into the business and production processes of companies. In order to improve the economic and social situation, the added value created by the regional economy must significantly increase. Entrepreneurs are also starting to be increasingly aware of the need for collaboration with other compatible companies, with the academic (research) community and with organizations and centers that support development. Unfortunately, there is a considerable fragmentation of information in this area. The project partners will combine the strengths in collecting, organizing and systematizing data on innovative and development-oriented enterprises, the competences of research institutions, existing incentives for innovation and development on both sides of the border, and proposing to improve the system of support activities that will serve innovative companies on the move from product development to a greater competitive advantage.     Specific cross-border objectives:     identifying the innovative potential of businesses and support institutions,     regional and cross-border integration of enterprises with research and education institutions (to enhance cooperation and increase the flow of knowledge and technology),     creating joint development ideas of companies and R & D institutions,     preparing proposals to promote the growth of innovative enterprises; recommendations aimed at the public sector and the economy for the implementation of the transfer of knowledge and technologies from the research to the corporate environment,     improving business \/ technological cooperation between regions in the cross-border area and integration of the field into international technological initiatives.     A publicly accessible database on the innovative potential of businesses and support institutions in the cross-border area.     New partnerships between companies and institutions \/ institutions in the field of R & D.     Analyzed companies and institutions with emphasis on R & D needs and activities related to technology transfer.     Increased number of cross-border partnerships between economic operators.     Increased number of joint R & D projects.     Benefits of project results for the local environment:     The project encourages the participation of companies from the wider Ptuj environment with supporting organizations and institutions of knowledge in development initiatives. It promotes the transfer of good business practices, the development of new products, services and technologies, and facilitates access to knowledge generated by research and development institutions and other companies.

Doslej so naziv pravi\u010dnik med narodi podelili \u017ee ve\u010d kot 24.000 ljudem iz 47 dr\u017eav, med njimi je ve\u010d kot 6.400 Poljakov.     Razstavo je pripravil POLIN \u2013 Muzej zgodovine poljskih Judov iz Var\u0161ave v sodelovanju z Ministrstvom za zunanje zadeve Republike Poljske. Razstava pripoveduje zgodbe o poljskih pravi\u010dnikih med narodi, ki so pomagali Judom v okupirani Poljski med drugo svetovno vojno. Pravi\u010dniki so tvegali tako svoja \u017eivljenja kot \u017eivljenja \u010dlanov svojih dru\u017ein, saj je pomo\u010d Judom bila kaznovana s smrtjo. Zaradi svojega poguma in nesebi\u010dnosti jim je uspelo re\u0161iti ve\u010d deset tiso\u010d poljskih Judov.     Danes \u017eivi le \u0161e pe\u0161\u010dica poljskih pravi\u010dnikov med narodi. Ve\u010dinoma so to ostareli ljudje, ki pa so \u0161e vedno dovolj pri mo\u010deh, da pripovedujejo svoje zgodbe in zgodbe ljudi, ki so jih re\u0161ili. Pri\u010devanja o osebnih izku\u0161njah ljudi imajo namre\u010d edinstveno znanstveno vrednost. \u0160tevilo Poljakov, ki jim podeljujejo naziv pravi\u010dnik med narodi, \u0161e naprej raste, saj se lahko naziv pravi\u010dnika podeli tudi po smrti.     Razstava, ki je od leta 2013 \u017ee obkro\u017eila svet in se je tokrat ustavila pri nas, je nastala na osnovi zbirke muzejskega projekta Poljski pravi\u010dniki \u2013 ohranjanje spomina (www.sprawiedliwi.org.pl).     Ob\u010dinstvo so na odprtju nagovorili \u010dastni pokrovitelj razstave dr. Andrej Fi\u0161travec, \u017eupan Mestne ob\u010dine Maribor, njegova ekscelenca gospod Pawel Czerwinski, poljski veleposlanik, in njegova ekscelenca gospod Shmuel Meirom, izraelski veleposlanik. Razstavo je predstavil dr. Krzysztof Bielawski iz muzeja POLIN. V kulturnem programu so nastopili dijaki II. gimnazije Maribor, ki so prireditev tudi povezovali.

        "text":" The Contributions to Contemporary History journal presents the recent research of the Slovenian (as well as foreign) historiography for the period of the 19th and 20th century (political, economic, cultural and social history). Initially the journal focused on the history of the workers' movement, but gradually its scope has been extended to include other topics as well. Apart from scientific articles the journal also publishes reviews and reports about the more important contemporary history works. The journal also regularly publishes historical documentation listing the selected historical sources complete with expert commentary.     Peer Review Process     All articles in the Contributions to Contemporary History are subject to double-blind reviews. This ensures not only the anonymity of the authors and reviewers, but also the quality and authenticity of the articles. Reviewers are appointed from among the experts in the field that the submitted work focuses on.     The editor-in-chief shall be the first to review all the submitted contributions. Should these contributions be suitable in terms of their contents, originality, methodology and scientific article typology, the editor shall appoint two reviewers.     The editorship shall ensure two reviews for every contribution fulfilling the aforementioned conditions. The reviewers must inform the editors of any potential conflicts of interests, which could affect their ability to provide unbiased reviews.     The reviewers shall evaluate the contributions in terms of their originality, importance for scientific development, scientific and methodological suitability (including the consideration of previous relevant research in the field under consideration), and suitable presentation of arguments. The Open Journal System tools shall be used for the reviews. The reviewers shall fill out the review form, indicating their decision on the final evaluation of the contribution, their findings, as well as potential notes for the authors and\/or editor-in-chief.     Four decisions are possible:     the contribution is accepted for publication without any corrections;     the contribution requires minor corrections: the authors should correct their contributions in line with the reviewers' comments and upload them to the Open Journal System; the decision shall be made by the editor-in-chief;     the contribution requires major corrections: the authors should correct their contributions thoroughly in line with the reviewers' comments and upload them to the Open Journal System; in accordance with the judgement of the editor-in-chief, the same reviewers shall re-check the corrected contributions;     the contribution is rejected.     In case of a negative review the articles cannot be published in the Contributions to Contemporary History journal. On the basis of a positive opinion of the reviewers, the editor-in-chief shall inform the authors about the acceptance of their contributions for publication (together with the publication category).     Before publication the authors shall also receive corrections, which they should review and confirm. The authors must return the corrections to the editorship within two workdays. The authors are responsible for all changes, which are not merely typographical corrections and format changes. Therefore it is advisable that the authors re-read the whole text carefully before the final submission.     Publication Frequency     Journal Prispevki za novej\u0161o zgodovino \/ Contributions to Contemporary History is published 3 times per. Individual items will be published as soon as they are ready, by adding them to the current issue's Table of Contents. IN PRESS issues are also availabe.     Open Access Policy     This journal provides immediate open access to its content on the principle that making research freely available to the public supports a greater global exchange of knowledge.

Fallow deer     Our guests can observe fallow deer at close quarters in a large field bounded by a fence. Because of their shovel-shaped antlers, they are also called shovel deer. There are 15 animals in the herd and they can reach a height of one meter at the shoulder. At the age of three years the male deer (bucks) develop broad, palm like antlers and weigh between 60 and 100 kg. In the wild, these animals can reach an age of 14 years. The female deer (does) are smaller, do not have antlers and bear young once a year in early summer. They are flexible and lively; the bucks often fight each other and at a gallop they can reach a speed of 50 km\/h. Adult fallow deer have a white mottled coat. Historically, this species was native to most of Europe. Later, they were introduced to the Middle East. Today, fallow deer are also raised in North and South America. In their natural surroundings they feed on grass.     Surroundings     Near the tourist farm there are three churches that are worth visiting. We recommend a short half an hour walk to the Church of the Holy Mother of God on Gorca, which features a renovated Way of the Cross, to the St. Peters church in Male\u010dnik, or to the St. Margaret church in Pernica. Our neighbours keep horses, and the Protner tourist farm is a great starting point for cycling and hiking tours over the hilly Slovenske gorice. You can also go fishing in the nearby lakes or in the Drava River.     Maribor     Also nearby, you can go sightseeing in Maribor to see the Old Vine, city centre, and city park. On the south side of the city you can take a cable car to the top of the Pohorje mountain. At the top there is a starting point for hiking trips or, in winter, cross-country skiing. Pohorje also features a world-class downhill skiing facility. Throughout the year you can visit one of the many local thermal spa centres. We also recommend visiting one of the cultural events, such as the Lent Festival or sports competitions, such as The Golden Fox World Cup skiing race for women that takes place in Maribor. Because of the excellent highway connections, the Prekmurje region is not far away. We recommend paying a visit to one of the thermal spas located there. "

        "text":" Did you know?     Hemp seed oil does not contain cholesterol and therefore contributes to the overall health of the cellular metabolism and consequently a stronger, more resiliant immune system. The average nutritional value of hemp seed oil per 100 g (values are average values of different varieties \u2013 may vary from variety to variety):     Gama linolenic acid (GLA): 3,6 g (compared to hemp seed oil a higher content of GLA is found only in evening primrose oil, borage seed oil and oil made from black currant seed. Of all of these mentioned oils, we must stress out that hemp seed oil is the only one that is edible) \u2013 GLA has great significance when boosting one's immune system.     Seeds     Hemp seeds are an excellent source of protein \u2013 they can containt up to three times as much protein an soy beans. What makes hemp seed especially unique is the fact that over 65% of the entire protein content is made up of globulins which are typical proteins of grains and legumes and are responsible for the transport of copper, fat, tyroxine and iron in the body as well as having a precursory function as building blocks for the formation of antibodies. The seeds also contatin all of the eight basic essential aminoacids in nearly perfect ratios, allowing them to be fully absorbed by the body and thus aiding it to form antibodies and boost one's immune system.     Stem - Shieves     Ways to use the stem:     Energy and environment (biofuel, ethanol, anti erosion matting)     Paper industry (cartons, paper, filtres,\u2026)     Constructrion and various industrial elements (bricks, insulation, fiber boards, briquettes,\u2026)     Agriculture (animal litter, vail, feed,\u2026)     and many many more     Stem - fibres     Hemp fibre is gained through the process of maceration (softening) or pealing (decortication). The fiber is 20 \u2013 200 cm long and consists of celulose, hemicelulose and lignine. Fiber collected from male plants are soft and flexible and contain approx. 18% of high quality fiber while fiber gained from female plants are rough, hard and less flexible containing approx. 12% of high quality fiber.     Uses of hemp fiber: technical textiles (ropes, nets, linen for tents, sails, rugs,\u2026), apparel (underwear, jackets, shoes, tablecloths, bedspreads, bed linen,\u2026), construction and industry (geotextile, biocomposites, non-woven tekstiels, tubes, insulation,\u2026)     Leaves and weeds     Hemp tea is made by soaking either dried leaves or the entire hemp plant in hot water (10 minutes). Though they posses a similar fenole profile as green teas, teas made from parts of a plant or the whole herb are called herbal teas.     Drinking hemp tea on a regular basis will boost your immune system, relieve pains caused by inflammatory diseases such as rheumatism, takes care of indigestion, has an overall antiinflammatory and antistress quality, boots energy levels, contains antioxidants,\u2026     Use: tea, juices, smoothies, cosmetics, feed, \u2026     Where to buy KonopKo hemp products?

        "text":" Significant contribution of the EU and Slovenia to the development of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus     Read next     The COVID-19 epidemic has again brought to the fore awareness about the importance of vaccines against communicable diseases as one of the most effective tools of modern medicine.     In the past we controlled or even eradicated once deadly communicable diseases, such as smallpox, polio and diphtheria, and thus saved millions of lives. A vaccine will therefore play a key role in the fight against the current epidemic, too, as it will likely be difficult to fully eradicate the novel coronavirus, for which we have not yet found an effective treatment.     A vaccine will play a key role in the fight against the current epidemic. Photo: FilippoBacci-GettyImages\/GulliverFilm&Foto     The COVID-19 epidemic has again brought to the fore awareness about the importance of vaccines against communicable diseases as one of the most effective tools of modern medicine. Photo: Andrew Brookers-GettyImages\/GulliverFilm&Foto     1 \/ 2     Together with international partners, the European Union hosted a worldwide pledging marathon at which funds were raised for research in the field of vaccines.     Since January 2020, the EU has earmarked close to EUR 50 million for research regarding the novel coronavirus. To date, it has approved grants for 17 projects involving 136 research teams.     The EU has a great deal of experience in supporting the development of vaccines. Of course, European countries are responsible for managing their own healthcare systems, and that includes vaccination programmes. The EU can help coordinate research, as it makes sense for scientists to pool knowledge and funding, instead of working separately in 27 countries. Since 2014, the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme has paid out EUR 500 million for research in the form of grants for international research projects in connection with vaccines for communicable diseases, such as Zika fever, influenza and Ebola.     The development and use of an effective and safe vaccine against the novel coronavirus represent a permanent solution for the epidemic. For this reason, the European Commission has formulated a strategy for vaccinating against the novel coronavirus. The primary objectives of that strategy are to ensure the quality, safety and effectiveness of vaccines, to ensure prompt access to vaccines by Members States, and to ensure equitable and affordable access to a vaccine for all citizens of the EU as soon possible.     An essential element of that strategy are advance purchase agreements, which the Commission would conclude with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of EU Member States.     The development and use of an effective and safe vaccine against the novel coronavirus represent a permanent solution for the pandemic. Photo: gevende-GettyImages\/GulliverFilm&Foto     Close to ten years is typically required to develop a vaccine, but the Commission intends to develop a vaccine within 12\u201318 months.     Money will be drawn from the Emergency Support Instrument, with an available budget of EUR 2.7 billion. The Commission will place orders on behalf of Member States in the scope of the aforementioned instrument. The vaccine is expected to be distributed between Member States according to the number of inhabitants.     The objective is to provide a vaccine for 300 million Europeans: the target is between 300 to 600 million doses, depending on whether one or two vaccinations will be required.     Slovenia also participating in the development of a vaccine     Slovenian experts from the Chemistry Institute are participating in one pre-clinical study.     A vaccine against the novel coronavirus, which was developed by a research team at the Chemistry Institute headed by Roman Jerala, demonstrated a high immune response in testing on mice, while antibodies neutralised viral binding to an extent comparable with other vaccines and antibodies in patients who have recovered from infection.     A press conference to present a new coronavirus vaccine developed at the Chemistry Institute. Photo: Bor Slana\/STA     The novelty of the method used by Jerala\u2019s team in the development of the aforementioned vaccine lies in the modification of viral proteins in nanoparticles that resemble viruses and thus improve the response of the immune system.     Jerala warned that these are the results of pre-clinical studies, meaning they are still in the initial phase, and that the road to the actual use of the vaccine is long. Extensive clinical studies involving humans are required, while Jerala believes that it makes no sense to continue with the development of the aforementioned vaccine once a safe and effective vaccine against the novel coronavirus is available Nevertheless, he assesses that the results represent a good guide for the continuation of studies, and may serve as a sound basis for the development of some vaccine for a potential new virus in the future.     A consortium will be organised in Slovenia in the future, when experts from the Chemistry Institute will be joined by researchers from the Veterinary Faculty and the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Ljubljana, doctors from the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the Ljubljana University Medical Centre, the University Clinical Department of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases in Golnik, and the company Jafral.     They will layout the process for the production of a vaccine for clinical studies and prepare documentation for the approval of those studies in accordance with high standards for the use of vaccines in humans.     Scientists hope that such cooperation will facilitate the development of a Slovenian treatment and its use in patients. "

Hover the mouse pointer over a document title to show the abstract or click on the title to get all document metadata.     Record is a part of a journal     ISSN:     Secondary language     Undetermined     Title:     Archive in the Arts     The article outlines the place of the idea of archive on the conceptual map of art practices. The concept of archive has gained a lot of momentum in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, not merely as a functional tool for preserving cultural heritage but as a central issue regarding cultural memory and the understanding of, as well as dealing with, the reality. The first part of the article begins by pointing to the archaeological approach in the humanities, in the works by Michel Foucault. Next the theory of new media object by Lev Manovich is presented, which integrates the database of multimedia materials and a multiplicity, i. e. an archive, of interfaces. The technical level and the cultural level of the computer-based communication are considered. Benjamin H. D. Buchloh has introduced a distinction in the understanding of avant-garde art practices between the aesthetics of montage\/ collage and the aesthetics of archive, which does not allow for the elements presented together to create a new unified whole. The inventors of the photomontage already after 1925 turn towards a didactical curation of photographic collections thereby rejecting the effects of the shock stemming from a surprising juxtaposition. The German artists after the 2nd World War connect the archival art to the traumatic memory. The next step is the institutional critique (of the modern museum) of Marcel Broodthaers, which considers the archive as the law of what can be said (Foucault), considering the current discourses and dispositifs. Damien Hirst is also presented from the institutional-critique point of view. The nanotechnology and the contemporary digitized reality are both a sort of discursive realities, that can be construed as a dispersion of regularities that have no natural hierarchical order \u2013 the nanotechnology homogenizes the world of materials on the atomic scale, dispensing with the traditional divisions of the material world, such as organic, inorganic etc. The mediatisation of architecture and environment transforms the world into a surface of statements: the increasingly manipulated reality becomes itself a window into the cultural archive, according to Peter Weibel. The photographic reflections and their theorization by Allan Sekula are used to point to the duality of realism and nominalism in philosophy: realism of general terms is needed, unless the world disintegrates into fragmentariness of particular cases. Starting from photographs, criminology attempts to create the criminal type, whereas criminalistics nominalistically chases this particular criminal body. Lev Manovich\u2019s synthetic realism is presented as an uneven simulation of reality in new media, which makes it archive-like, a constellation of signs that represent (photo)realism. The second part of the article explains in detail Walter Benjamin\u2019s theory of the German counter-reformation Trauerspiel (mourning play) from his The Origin of German Tragic Drama (1928), and aligns it with his theory of the technical media, e.g. from his famous paper The Work Art in the Age of Technical Reproduction. The reality and the artwork are both archive-like, but not in an empirical way, starting from experience, but and archive of ruins, filed sign vehicles that have lost all their meanings. Everything is corpse-like, which ominously points towards the impending holocaust. In the conclusion of the second part of the article a moment from a digital video by Slovene video artist Sre\u010do Dragan, who together with Nu\u0161a Dragan is the author of the first video in former Yugoslavia in 1969, is analysed. Dragan\u2019s Rotas Axis Mundi (1995\/96) video deals with the war in Bosnia in a way that does not betray the victims by exploiting their suffering by making it representable, even spectacular, and integrating it into the cultural industry (as criticized by the Frankfurt School).

(is only with CN+ with closed front)     It looks in such a way from the inside:     and if one rausschraubt plastics inside (caution because of the Micro of the free intercom) and the display from the small monitor housing develops, then it fits super hinter\/in this frameworks:     and then also without adjustment by the interior one holds!     Only the small rails inside at the back of the front had to be shortened little, thus the Dispaly beautifully behind it \u201cslip\u201d\u2026     Then with the help of the mask of the housing of the display the necessary cutout mark and rausdremeln\u2026     @ruhige hand urgently necessarily!!! RESPECT Tobi     Since now the sounded \u201cdisk\u201d is missing before the display, we darkened the glass on the plate with black hue foil, become too sharp thus it nich!!! So, now then times the tail apron had off\u2026The screws above at the Ladekante and down under the apron are no problem, however the tail apron is also still lateral in the fender with 2 (!!!) Screws held!An diese kommt man nur dran, wenn man den Radkasten los macht (die Matte - mit Schr\u00e4ubchen befestigt)     and then into the narrow pit (autsch) upward through gropes along\u2026 Those are genuinly bl\u00f6d to reach\u2026 And note! = 1x Torx and 1x cross     But if one tormented oneself there through and also on both sides solved, one can take the tail apron off \u201csimply\u201d\u2026 (Request no comments on my super cleared up trunk!)     Then one measures the distances between the sensors and marks themselves, where they \u201csit\u201d are\u2026 Now with the provided drill carefully on the markings boring (if there painted surfaces is, Kreppband or sowas more probably makes more dr\u00fcber, then is it that he tears lacquer nich\u2026 But although no warranty) and then pull the Kapel through     and the sensor use (clean-press)!     and is pleased, how well that everything fits!     Then first times break and little continue to sleep and on the next day outside in beautiful weather in the text\u2026     In order to be able to work on several places equal timely and come, first times the small ones postitionieren correctly more comfortably to the whole things to and then highly take in front\u2026     -> hectar? Is also down differently than the 3 the T\u00fcer\u2026     But nevertheless it was then set up after short stably!     Country equipment\u2026     Then the front apron had down\u2026 First above the screws in the engine compartment loosen (over the front grill), the screws down under the apron and also under the engine cover (must be removed!) are still screws\u2026 Then, as it could be also different, still inside in the fender, exactly the same as in the back removes (tip: Wheels in such a way turn that one has more place\u2026). Thus wheel housings screw loosely (the mat) and again upward keys and the 2 screws remove\u2026 Now also the front apron can be taken off.     Caution: if you like I headlight wash nozzles have, must be taken off in front on the left of the hose (attention disk water tank runs empty), before one can pull the apron completely away!!!     After all sensors in the back are inserted and one the cables inward led (behind the Stossi to shift cleanly) can the Stossi again be attached\u2026     As small tip: at the rear left down there is a large rubber plug (plug), by which one can lead the cables inward. Comes directly in the trunk raus\u2026     Then our PAT was added as support     Then with Marco first times the instrument panel apart-built:     Afterwards both looked for an entrance to the engine compartment, in order also from here late cables through to lead\u2026 Sign     Tip: Plug at the rear left a little downward in the engine compartment     Tobi with tinker (a sensor was unfortunately nich completely ok)     And Pat was gladly, finite as it after longer fight the glove subject raus had!!!     hen also again the sensors similarly in the back insert:     And Marco was still at fighting with the instrument panel\u2026     Then still another clean \u201cwiring harness\u201d from the 4 sensor cables tinker:     the interior to the cable through-lead prepare     und den Platz f\u00fcr die Steuereinheit \u00f6ffnen, vorbereiten (bei mir hinten links) und Kabel rausleiten...     then the cables into the interior through-lead     make a clean wiring harness from the 4 cables for also far, so that everything can be shifted cleanly:     and the cable cleanly lay\u2026     then still the cable to the display in the roof lay and cultivate     and PAT is in good spirits     after the display sits     o build the instrument panel fast again together, even if some corner were to be blocked nich completely so easily\u2026     and our Tobi rooted itself already times by the connection diagram and the cable chaos, so that then also everything can be attached correctly\u2026     during its I times to made yourself to remove the lights so that we can see, which cable (color) at which pear arrives\u2026     But the Frontstossi was still nich again to     even if Pat assemble already again with from the instrument panel were\u2026     and Kati screwed the lamps together again, after we had checked the lines     and I have the thing again inserted\u2026     Marco has itself then fallen on the control unit and begun to attach\u2026     and one can let the picture well stand without words\u2026     Since the sensors with lighting are, also connections had to be put to the light on the right side:     Hose of the headlight nozzles nich forget again to attach\u2026     and the Stossi again to installs push (simply drauf)     Marco has in the time further with the connections fought\u2026     Then also naturally also again the wheel housings (mat) bolt on!     Tobi has first times its earned P\u00e4uschen made\u2026     \u2026 and then again with Marco further attached.So\u2026 Still firmly screw the engine cover and good\u2026     Juhuuuuuuuu!!! Finally river on the display!!!     and my small becomes again ever completely\u2026     Unfortunately we noticed then that the sensors also flash in the case of normal drive (e.g. 5x blue with brake and left in each case or right red also with flash), so that we had to integrate still another switch, in order to switch the Dinger on and out\u2026     Thus the center console must raus, in order to insert a switch\u2026     After long superior we on the fact agreed that the best place is with mine under the BRANCH switch in the picture switch, where the Abarth has its mechanism key\u2026     Thus the Dremelmeister had again ran\u2026     Now still insert the switch and to solder cables (caution because of the plate, dirket under the switch sits!!!)\u2026     \u2026 and finished!     Then Marco has the switch built in the circuit and now still accordingly does everything\u2026 As soon as the reverse gear is inserted, activate the system automatically and if I need it for in front, simply switches on and 6 seconds on the brake, then are active the sensors\u2026     Evo preveden \u0161e tole ponovno se OPRAVI\u010cUJEM \u010de kj ni ql....

Today VIPAP is the largest paper mill in Slovenia and a leading newsprint manufacturer in SE Europe. Its added value stems from using perfected technological processes in pulp and paper production, ensuring comprehensive and quality solutions for its customers, and operating in coexistence with nature and society.     Technologically Advanced Processes     Between 1997 and 2009 the company invested EUR 141 million in modernising technological processes and making them less of a burden on the environment. At the same time it increased the total production of pulp and paper to 440,000 tonnes a year. The most comprehensive investment cycle in the company\u2019s history was completed in 2009 with the ceremonial launch of an upgraded paper machine, used to produce even higher quality newsprint made from recycled fibres. The investment cycle has allowed VIPAP to compete successfully with companies in Europe and worldwide.

Maglaj is an esteemed European company enjoying high reputation in the field of production of various types of paper and paper packaging. It was founded on 15 April 2005 by company Natron d.d. Maglaj and the reputable company Kastamonu Entegre company, which is a member of the internationally renowned Hayat Holding Group from Turkey. This newly established company has inherited a 50-year-old tradition and experience in the paper industry (based on the successful work of the former Natron d.d. Maglaj).     The damage suffered by Natron d.d. Maglaj during the war between 1992 and 1995 was extensive, so after the Joint Venture company was founded in 2005 it was necessary to start an investment program and revitalisation process of the facilities that were once giving life to this company. Contracts have been signed with the world's leading manufacturers of pulp mill equipment, paper machines and waste water treatment systems: ANDRITZ AG (Austria), ANDRITZ OY (Finland), EXOR(Croatia), ENVIROTEK (Turkey), IED (Germany), GL&V (USA), TURBOTEH (Croatia), KADANT Johnson (Italy), A. CELLI PAPER S.p.a. (Italy).     Natron-Hayat currently employs more than 840 workers. A great number of young and highly qualified employees, along with older experts of various profiles, are making every effort to meet the expectations of every customer. All of them together represent a company that you can trust. Side-by-side with the reconstruction and revitalisation of the old facilities and investments in the new facilities within Natron-Hayat, our preserved plants are constantly operational. Therefore, at this point, we can offer the following products: packaging paper, MG (machine glazed) paper, crepe paper, finishing paper, paper sacks, paper bags, corrugated board and board packaging, cores. With its current production, our company meets not only the domestic market needs but also those outside the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.     In the beginning of the second half of 2007, after the completion of all works in the mill, Natron-Hayat will broaden its production program encompassing products such as Semi-Extensible and Kraft paper sacks. Natron-Hayat means a business system with high production quality and business professionalism, which have been proved for so many times in both domestic and foreign markets. Subsequent to this enormous investment in modern production systems, it is guaranteed that Natron-Hayat will continue supplying its customers in accordance with the market needs and the competition. We hope that you will recognise your needs in some of our products, because it is a virtue of a modern man to have a developed consciousness for the preservation of our environment. We are certain that our cooperation will be a successful one to our mutual interest and pleasure.     Mondi\u2019s strategic positioning demonstrates the required combination of focus and flexibility to deliver results across the business cycle as we:     build on leading positions in packaging and UFP, particularly in high-growth emerging markets     maintain our low-cost, high-quality asset base by selectively investing in production capacity in lower-cost regions and realising benefits of upstream integration (including forestry);     focus on performance through continuous productivity improvement and cost reduction, delivered through business excellence programmes and rigorous asset management.     For a more detailed review of the Group\u2019s strategy, please refer to the chief executive\u2019s review in the integrated annual report and accounts 2011.     Leading market positions     Mondi continues to focus on achieving the right product and geographic mix in order to promote sustained profitability. The Group benefits from exposure to faster growing emerging markets such as Eastern Europe, Russia and South Africa, with 71% of the Group\u2019s net operating assets and 50% of revenue by destination based in these geographical areas. Our bias towards emerging markets is in line with our vision of focusing on low-cost, high-growth regions and on businesses offering leading market positions and operational synergies with existing businesses. While our strategy clearly focuses on emerging markets, Mondi continues to enjoy a uniquely strong market position in the Bags & Coatings business in both Eastern and Western Europe, where the coatings and consumer packaging segment enjoys very attractive growth rates and returns. We will therefore continue to support our market position in Bags & Coatings with our existing Western European assets.     High-quality, low-cost asset base     Over the past 10 years, Mondi has invested more than \u20ac4.5 billion in its high-quality, low-cost asset base and our state-of-the-art operations are delivering superior returns across the cycle. Mondi\u2019s UFP business is reaping the rewards of its integrated low-cost positioning, while the recently restructured Corrugated business delivered strong results. The Bags & Coatings business enjoys good, and in many cases leading, market shares in its key markets. The Group has approved certain energy related investments across a number of its operations, including a bark boiler in Syktyvkar; a steam turbine in Stambolijski; a new recovery boiler in Frantschach; and a steam turbine in Richards Bay.

The Print programme manufactures offset printing blankets for the printing industry, a well-established product in the professional spheres. All named products are manufactured from the in-house developed compounds that we supply to external users too. The industrial rubber products and tyres that are manufactured in the company Savatech have all been developed on the existing expertise of our employees.     Besides products we provide services of the Central laboratory, including a physical and chemical laboratory, as well as construction design and development institute.     Pursuing the quality of products and services, the company obtained a range of international certificates. In our company, a special attention is devoted to the environment.     The company Savatech is outstandingly export-driven. By modernising, developing and rationalising its operations it makes a decisive contribution to a successful establishing of the Slovene economy in the international business streams. The company makes the majority of its export through its foreign trade companies in Great Britain, Germany, Poland and United States, and representative office in Russia.     Cartiere del Polesine S.p.A.\u2019s origins date back to the 50s, when the company used to produce paper made from straw. During the following years the business gradually expanded from 130-ton daily production in the 60s\/70s to the current 900 tons. Since the early 80s production has been totally based on the recovery of waste paper originating from waste sorting or from general packaging.     In 1986, the Scantamburlo Family, who had been operating for years in the recovered paper market, took over the Loreo plant. Right from the start, the new management focused on company innovation and expansion: the two Loreo PMs were immediately revamped and reorganized, and continuous production introduced. In 1999 a new machine - PM 3 - was put into operation on the nearby Adria Industrial Area (AIA).     In 2004 important new investment was achieved: PM 4 started its production, with a wider and higher product range, noticeably increasing total production capacity.     The Adria plant start-up also marked a new approach in the industry: a more attentive focus on developing production activity in line with respect for the environment from the point of view of sustainability. After a new waste water treatment plant was put into operation (2003), the company adopted the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, and was awarded with Certification in 2006.     Today Cartiere del Polesine S.p.A. is still a family-owned company and a major player in the Italian containerboard industry. It rates its customers among the most important domestic and international corrugated packaging manufacturers, serving prestigious overseas converters as well. In the Basso Polesine area it is a consolidated and important company whose dynamic business contributes long-term to the development of the local economy.     The company\u2019s history reaches back to 1973, when the production hall of the muflon facility was built, where we started to produce self-adhesive materials. Until today, we have modernised the production in the company by making constant improvements, we have improved working conditions and increased our competition in the domestic and foreign markets. What remained were customs, experience and efforts to make products that fulfil the wishes and needs of the printers entirely.     Today, Muflon employs more than 150 co-workers. We produce 20 million square metres of self-adhesive materials and foil annually. We also produce various printed matter, self-adhesive labels and ready-made paper articles for purposes of education, office communication and artistic creation. With our products, we are present in the Slovenian market, as well as in the markets of the neighbouring countries.     We delight in our successful operations together with the environment, in which we work. We share our successes with our employees, to whom we enable a safe working environment. We take part of numerous humanitarian, sport, cultural and educational projects, and thus build our company\u2019s social responsibility.     From the tradition of paper production to the tradition of paper processing.     Iberpapel is an integrated paper manufacturing group with a commitment to quality, service and the environment. It is one of the leading players in Spain's printing and writing paper market.     The origins of the Iberpapel Group date back to the incorporation of the company Papelera Guipuzcoana de Zicu\u00f1aga in 1935 and it has engaged in the manufacture of cellulose paste and paper since then. The Group was listed on the stock market in 1997. It is an integrated international group of companies with operations in Europe, South America and the North of Africa. The business model is based on pro-duction process integration and industrial flexibility, productivity and cost leadership, with the emphasis on sustainability and respect for the environment.     Iberpapel and its subsidiaries form an integrated group that is directly involved in all the areas of the paper manufacturing process:     Forestry activities in 25,170 hectares of land in Spain, Argentina and Uruguay.     Manufacture of cellulose fibre at the plant in Hernani (Guip\u00fazcoa), with a capacity of 185,000 Tm per annum.     Production and selling of paper, with a capacity of 250,000 Tm per annum.     Energy generation capacity of 60 Mw\/h.     Three separate production lines at the Hernani plant guarantee the flexibility of the Group's manufacturing process.     Iberpapel Group is committed to sustainable development, meaning that its economic, environmental and social objectives advance hand in hand. This commitment is based on sustainable forest management, the use of the best technologies available and optimal energy efficiency.     Very few companies can claim a longer or more distinguished heritage than Fabriano. Dating back to 1264, the Fabriano mill\u2019s fine arts papers were used and highly praised by Michelangelo. Fabrianese paper masters pioneered many of the processes now common in paper manufacture today, including the watermark and the technique of surface sheet gluing using gelatine. In 2002, Fabriano became part of the Fedrigoni Group, which backed it with significant new investments. The company is committed to renewable energy and makes extensive use of self-generated hydroelectric power. The production yield from the six continuous machines, one of which is dedicated entirely to producing bank notes and security papers, makes the company unique in the European paper industry and one of the leading players in its field worldwide. Production of the various different types of Fabriano paper takes place at four different plants:     Fabriano     This plant employs a workforce of approximately 271 people. The current structure dates back to 1977 with the start-up of a new production line featuring a Fourdrinier machine to run alongside the pre-existing cylinder machine production line. The factory occupies a covered surface area of 36,000 m\u00b2 and boasts a Fourdrinier machine, three cylinder machines, a modern plant for producing cotton cellulose \u2013 the raw material used to manufacture the most important fine arts and security paper \u2013 and a \u2018vat\u2019 department where paper is produced by hand. As paper is produced here for Euro banknotes and other currencies, the entire plant is protected by an impressive security system that is certified by the European Central Bank. It is precisely for the production of the Euro that recent years have seen major investment in this plant. This investment has resulted in the development of a new cutting, sorting and packaging line for banknote paper, and of a machine required for the simultaneous continuous application of holograms and silk screen bands printed with colour shifting inks \u2013 security features used on the new European banknote.     Rocchetta     This is the newest production plant: it has been up and running since 1993 and today employs 112 people, taking up a total area of 130,000 m\u00b2, of which 45,000 m\u00b2 are covered. The complex includes a cutting department developed with four sheeters and a packer, the packing line, an intensive centralised warehouse and a fully-automatic logistics and distribution centre.     Pioraco     The plant occupies a covered surface area of 15,500 m\u00b2, employs approximately 145 people and is equipped with two Fourdrinier machines with a total production capacity of around 45,000 tons\/year, three sheeters, a guillotine and four finishing machines.

Cordenons     Belonging to the Counts Avanzo of Cordenons from 1630, it became property of the Galvani family, well known local entrepreneurs, in 1730. The citations by the Senate of Doges about the importance of the \u201cCartera de Cordenon\u201d, the Venetian Republic official paper supplier, date back to that period. Since 1984 the paper factory, completely renovated in its structures, is under the direction of the Gilberti family, continuing its orientation towards the production of high quality special paper.     2 continuous machines equipped with in line computerised control system (PM1: 160 cm \u2013 weight 60-400 g\/m2; PM2: 160 cm \u2013 weight 200-1500 g\/m2 single ply)     2 off-line coater machines equipped with in line computerised control system     4 core cutters     4 embossing machines     1 paper cutter     2 automatic packing machines     Scurelle     Built in 1715, the paper factory belonged to various Venetian families, and was bought in 1936 by Senator Beniamino Donzelli, who together with his son-in-law Ferruccio Gilberti boosted its fate, and was eventually left, in 1973, entirely under the direction of the Gilberti family, which began specialising in the production of fine paper.     1 continuous machine equipped with in line computerised control system (PM3: 160 cm \u2013 weight 70-400 g\/m2)     \"Taking on the customers\u2019 problems -even the most difficult- to immediately provide the most suitable solutions\".     This was the winning idea of Enrico Pellegrini (1909-1978), the founder of Colorgraf, an idea that led him to compete and establish himself as one of the top producers of the printing ink market and to stay independent of multinational groups. The excellence of the range of Colorgraf products, which are able to fulfil all printers\u2019 needs, is the direct result of the company\u2019s long experience in the field, the skill of listening to the client\u2019s needs and of the sophisticated technology used in the company\u2019s research and development laboratory. Each product is fine-tuned and tested in-house, reproducing various operating conditions in order to meet the most diverse needs, while paying the utmost attention to environmental problems and user safety. In today\u2019s globalised world Colorgraf presents itself as a highly specialised producer and a service company which keeps a close direct relationship with its customers. To Colorgraf, ink is a product of high technological value, able to help in defending and increasing the value of all printed matter. Another of Colorgraf\u2019s strong points is the flexibility of the solutions it offers its customers and its rapid delivery time, thanks to the managerial criteria adopted by Paolo and Guido Pellegrini, who now run the company in Lainate, 15 km north-west of Milan. The company\u2019s current headquarters, where it has been operating since 1962, represent the natural evolution of an entrepreneurial story which began in Milan in 1951. Today Colorgraf is an industrial reality which makes use of the most modern equipment and occupies an area of 24.000 square meters, of which 7000 are covered indoor space (3000 more are under construction), and where more than 100 highly qualified employees work.     The \"Cartonificio Sandreschi\" was born in 1863 in the valley of Villa Basilica, outpost of modernity in recycled paper and cardboard production. The production is oriented, right from the beginning, towards cardboard, which was once produced from straw. The latter was left to macerate with lime and a sheet was created thanks to rudimental machines which operated exclusively with hydrolic force; the sheets were then dried in special rooms called \"spanditoi\", still visible today next to the new machinery. The Cartonificio Sandreschi, which has always followed technological evolution, was the first firm in the area to adopt steam drying cylinders in the 30ies. Today the pioneering images of the beginning of the century have been substituted by more modern technologies thanks to which the Cartonificio Sandreschi has been operating for over 140 years in the semi-processed recycled cardboard production sector.     RDM Group is the leading Italian and second-largest European producer of coated recycled cartonboard and one of the most important in the production of virgin fibre cartonboard.     Burgo Group is one of the European's leading producers of coated papers.     Today Burgo Group is a complete system developed around the world of paper: production, distribution, paper recycling and processing of forestry products, the study, design, construction and engineering of paper industry plant systems, but also factoring and energy.     A full range of top quality papers, creation of new solutions, aptitude for new product research and development, care for the environment: all of this sums up a dynamism indicative of our drive for continuous growth. And thanks to this Burgo Group can claim to be a partner and benchmark in the graphics, printing and publishing sectors.     A way of interpreting and conducting our business that sees it as an integral part of a much wider system. So it will be no surprise that sustainable growth is a core concept for Burgo Group, one found in each and every process, from the purchase and utilisation of resources to purification of waste water or optimisation and reuse of production waste to generate energy.     Burgo Group is committed to expand its business and transform its know-how for application in other strategic areas, such as paper product distribution, engineering and energy.     Paper is our history, our core business, but also our future     A company with a difference that has kept itself apart from the extensive mergers that have drastically changed the printing inks industry, the BRANCHER Company is pursuing its development while faithfully keeping to its strategy of remaining an independent player in the market. A responsible Company, we invest in technical innovation by putting in place, as an absolute top priority, all possible measures to preserve the Environment and apply the REACH directive.

One of the largest Bohemia paper-mill is only 5 km away from the \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov Castle. The first written notice about its history is in 1870. The tradition of paper manufacturing in \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov started four centuries before. The history of the V\u011bt\u0159n\u00ed papermill had been preceded by Ignac Spiro , a paper-processing businessman, who came to \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov and bought the local second papermill, established in 1792, from Theodor Pachner in 1861. Due to the production extent Spiro was forced to buy The Pe\u010dkovsk\u00fd mill near V\u011bt\u0159n\u00ed in 1870. First intended as a pulp mill for the \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov papermill. Nine years later there were already three paper-processing machines. The plant was the bearer of the progress in paper-processing technology all over Austria-Hugary, and later in the independent state as well. In 1883 a sulphate wood pulp machine was launched. In 1911 the world largest paper-processing machine to manufacture rotary print paper was constructed. In 1926 the Spiros family, as the first in republic, introduced the production of sulphate cellulose. A hydroelectric power station from 1903 in Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Brod belongs to Spiro\u00b4s interesting achievements of technology. Its power at the voltage of 15,000V was supplied to the paper-mill and adjacent parts of South Bohemia. Spiro\u00b4s factory in V\u011bt\u0159n\u00ed located the later established national enterprise Jiho\u010desk\u00e9 pap\u00edrny.     \u2018Galileo Nanotech\u2019 Joint Stock Company is Eastern Europe\u2019s largest manufacturer of metallized materials \u2013 paper, board, and film.

MSc thesis.     Abstract     The goal of this thesis was a study of classic and mobile botnets and the possibilities of their detection, implementation of a network traffic based botnet detector and a mobile application for malware detection on the Android operating system. We created a botnet detector that uses a machine learning model for classification of network flows as either legitimate or botnet-induced traffic. We evaluated the detector by two distinct testing procedures and commented on its advantages and limitations. We developed an Android application that detects malware by observing network connections to malicious resources and exploiting some of the known security vulnerabilities in the operating system. We tested the application on some malware samples and offered it to the users of the official Android marketplace.     Item Type:     Thesis (MSc thesis)     Keywords:     computer security, botnet, botnet detection, network traffic analysis, security of mobile devices, malware, Android "

Pe\u010dico segrej na 200\u00b0C. 2. Peso (z lupino) prelij z olivnim oljem in posoli ter ovij v aluminijasto folijo. 3. Peci 45 minut, dokler se pesa toliko ne zmeh\u010da, da jo lahko prebode\u0161 z vilico. Vzemi iz pe\u010dice in pusti, da se malo ohladi. Lupino bo\u0161 zdaj z lahkoto odstranila. 4. Peso v posodi z vilico zme\u010dkaj v pire. Pusti pri miru pribli\u017eno 2 uri, da se popolnoma ohladi. 5. Popolnoma gladkemu in mrzlemu pesinemu pireju dodaj gr\u0161ki jogurt in med ter vse skupaj dobro preme\u0161aj. 6. Zmes prelij v aparat za sladoled ali pa jo preprosto samo postavi v zamrzovalnik. 7. Po 30-ih minutah je pripravljen, da ga postre\u017ee\u0161.

It takes its name, translating as 'Dormouse Fort', from the Slovenian word for an Old Slavonic fortified settlement. The old village centre, which is still partially preserved, developed at the foot of the hill and next to the majestic 18th century Baroque Parish Church of St. Mary's Birth. The gilded 18th century Baroque main altar is a work by the Facijs, a local family of engravers. "

        "text":" Taking a motorail train     It\u2019s 6:40 in the evening. The old lady is removing the blinds that were protecting her apartment from the scorching sun. A force of habit, probably: she knows that in a couple of minutes, a train will leave the station at Most na So\u010di for Bohinjska Bistrica, and she\u2019ll be able to assuage her curiosity. The whistle sounds, and the 103 tonnes of the so-called Reagan locomotive at the end of the train composition spring to life. The train moves from the loading track to the plain line track, waiting for that same locomotive to overtake all other cars and regain its place at the head of the train. Precisely at 6:45, it leaves the station at Most na So\u010di. Just like clockwork, much like any other train...but this one is a bit special. It allows you to enjoy the comfort of your own car and go for a drive, but without having to turn, speed up, or slow down.     Our weekend in Bovec ended a little faster than planned: instead of taking our usual route home over Predel where I\u2019m practically driving on autopilot, I suggested a different, somewhat more scenic, route. We drove through the upper So\u010da Valley past Kobarid, stopped for fantastic cakes at Kavarna Kasarna in Tolmin, and ended up in Most na So\u010di, where one can take a motorail train four times a day. Since there aren\u2019t enough places left on the train sometimes, it\u2019s best to be at the station about an hour before the train leaves. Make sure to be there at least 20 minutes beforehand, however, since loading the cars takes quite some time.     After loading the train and leaving the station, the adventurous journey begins. The composition is rocking back and forth on worn-out tracks, and I feel as if I were on a roller coaster, especially because I only parked my car a mere 20 cm behind the bumper of the Italian car in front of me. Dashing along at 70 km\/h and practically without any safety distance is, after all, a funny, yet uncomfortable feeling. When going uphill, the railroad engineer is pushing the vintage 664-115 locomotive to its limits: smoke is pouring out of its exhaust pipes, with the noise of the locomotive and its cars accompanying the whole shebang. It's not very environmentally friendly, but having all these cars drive through the Sorica Valley would hardly be any better... If the noise of the locomotive bothers you, it might be better to take the motorail train in the opposite direction (from Bohinjska Bistrica to Most na So\u010di).     The real adventure, however, is driving through tunnels and over bridges. The track called the \u201cBohinj Track\u201d was built at the turn of the 20th century. Some 28 tunnels, 5 galleries and 65 bridges extend over 144 km. The most impressive accomplishment was probably building the tunnel between Bohinjska Bistrica and Podbrdo. With a length of 6,327 m, it represents the longest Slovenian tunnel. At first, they began building it manually, by nailing rods into rocks, filling up the holes with dynamite, and blowing them up. The last couple of years, however, they used a drilling machine. The first locomotive drove through the tunnel 5 years after the beginning of the construction.     Driving through the Ba\u010da Valley, we\u2019re observing the villages built in these godforsaken places. We see more grannies at their windows, curiously watching the cars that the train brings by this time around. Now and then, we also spot a grey-haired grandpa, leaning on his cane while sitting on a bench in front of his house with a pitcher of wine on the table. And then it struck me... the Ba\u010da Valley. This is where the phrase \u201czaba\u010deni kraj\u201d (a place in the middle of nowhere) comes from. We're checking out the hills surrounding us, making plans about where to climb next. It is especially interesting to see Mount Sorica where one can still admire the remnants of defensive strong points built during the Treaty of Rapallo. But it would be equally interesting to get to know the people who live in the valley. What are their lives like? What wisdom could they impart to me? What makes them stay here?     I guess their reasons are related to humility, and to the fact that they\u2019re used to living in small villages where people greet each other loudly and all know each other. They don't need more: they don\u2019t need to travel around the world or move to a larger town where their lives could be easier, where they could have more income, and where a Hofer would greet them at every corner. Here\u2019s a thought: sometimes, we don\u2019t need to go to the end of the world to experience and realise something new. By simply changing our usual ways, an interesting adventure might be just around the corner.     If you're staying in Poso\u010dje, I would warmly recommend you take the motorail train. In addition to natural beauty offered by the So\u010da Valley, you\u2019ll also be able to see a part of our technical heritage. Vintage locomotives and the track built at the time of Franz Joseph I of Austria make it all even more special. I have yet to meet someone who wouldn\u2019t be impressed by the track. Maybe I've given you an idea for a field trip in autumn: the Bovec Valley and its surroundings shine the most in the off-season, when the hordes of tourists leave. "

        "text":" Preobrazba pode\u017eelske kulturne pokrajine v Sloveniji     Authors     The book offers multi-layered responses to the scope and causes of spatial, as well as social, economic and physiognomic changes in the cultural landscape in Slovenian countryside. It presents the results of an interdisciplinary research approach to recognising spatial change and trends within a two-year research project entitled \"The Transformation of the Landscape by Agricultural Modernisation and Changes in Settlement Patterns\", which was financed by the Slovenian Research Agency and the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning of the Republic of Slovenia within the target research programme Slovenian Competitiveness 2006\u20132013. Similar research was carried out in three pilot areas, selected because they captured a cross section of typical Slovenian landscape macro-units (Mediterranean, Dinaric, Alpine and Pannonian), while also covering the processes of intensification and marginalisation. The cadastral communities of \u017dalec and Gotovlje within the \u017dalec municipality offer an example of intensification; the two are in contact with both the Alpine and the Pannonian regions. The cadastral community of Ko\u017ebana in the municipality of Brda, as a representative of the Mediterranean region, and the cadastral community of Sela pri Hinjah in the municipality of \u017du\u017eemberk, representing the Dinaric region, were selected to illustrate marginalisation. The geographical outline includes a general description of each area, placing it within its wider landscape unit, with data on rock, surface features, and waters, climate, soils and vegetation, population and settlements. This is supplemented with an outline of the landscape form and agriculture and its recent historical development. Thematic maps of settlement patterns are produced at the cadastral community and individual settlement levels. The state of selected farms in pilot areas is also described and reasons for their expansion given. Land use reveals changes in agricultural methods, land abandonment, forest re-growth, the expansion of urbanisation and industrialisation and similar. Landscape regionalisation and typing of the selected areas is a development and supplementation of existing regional divisions by landscape type in Slovenia. The conclusion of the work presents three spatial development scenarios, proposed general and specific guidelines for settlement expansion and policies to protect and manage individual agricultural units at the local level. In the case of the Ko\u017ebana cadastral community the local issue of potential landslides is studied, while in another two pilot areas the spatial and function changes in settled land are studied. Some general problems are defined which arise in the projecting of new buildings and spatial plans for rural areas, and evaluating landscape changes in terms of the settlement system and in terms of the evaluation and policy-making to protect and manage individual features of landscape value. The book also sets out a series of proposed instruments to direct spatial development. "

        "text":" Abstract Submission CLOSED Acceptance note July 1 Reduced early payment fee July 15     Dynamic treatment regimes as a prediction problem     Elja Arjas University of Helsinki and University of Oslo     Adequate medical treatment of many diseases, including different types of cancer, involves a sequence of treatment assignments over time. For an optimal allocation, each assignment of a new treatment should be allowed to depend adaptively on how the patient responded to the ones that were administered previously. The task of establishing a close-to-optimal dynamic treatment regime of this type for patients with different individual characteristics, based on the accrued follow-up information, offers several challenges which are both conceptual and technical. The purpose of this talk is to consider their solution from a Bayesian perspective, by combining tools from constrained nonparametric modeling of stochastic processes and their inference, and the consequent predictive distributions, with dynamic programming for establishing the optimum. While the ideas underlying this approach are general, practical considerations will often restrict their direct applicability, and require that certain simplifying assumptions in the modeling are employed. An example based on HIV data is considered as an illustration. "

Processing Instructions (PIs) are lines that start with a \"#\" character followed by a keyword and optionally some arguments; the keyword is always handled case-insensitive. Two consecutive hash marks at the start of a line are a comment that won't appear in the processed page.     All PIs must appear at the very start of a page.

MoinMoin knows few pragmas, and you may add more and use them for your own themes or macros. Here are the known pragmas:     section-numbers     Switches automatic numbering of section headers.     off or 0 disable numbering, on or 1 enables numbering. The default mode is set by the show_section_numbers config option.     When enabling numbering, its possible to use specific heading level:     Only displays section numbers for headings of level 2 and up (similarly for 3 to 6).     keywords     adds a <meta> tag with keywords which tells search engines what you can find on the particular page.     description     adds a <meta> tag which contains the description of the particular page.     supplementation     is used to enable or disable a supplementation for the current page e.g. a discussion page     off disables the supplementation for the current page. See also HelpOnConfiguration\/SupplementationPage for more.     #deprecated     Mark this page as deprecated.     Further changes to the page will create no backup versions and using it will cause the current revision to show along with the revision previous to the deprecation. This allows you to remove all of the page's content, insert #deprecated, and then write a short message explaining the reason behind this action. By doing this you are effectively freezing the last version of the page and reducing its rank in search results, but you are keeping the content available for viewing.     Removing the PI from the page will store no backup of the deprecation warning.     In comparison to #REDIRECT this PI gives the ability to give the user a reason why this page is no longer of use and why they should go to a new one, while #REDIRECT will throw them to the new page without any reason.

For this reason, the subject will initially provide knowledge about anthropometry, particularly functional anthropometry, which is of key importance for the design of a workplace, about the skeletal system, skeletal muscles, the neuromuscular control system, circulatory system and metabolic system. Included will also be visual and auditory information and the consequences of vibrations for the worker\u2019s health. Special attention will be paid to assessment analysis of workplace, which is rather complex and therefore placed at the end, when the student is well acquainted with burdens and the response of the human body to them. Having learned how to assess a risk for a healthy human and how to design workplaces with prevention in mind and improve the already working non-ergonomic workplaces, students will deal with particularly complex groups of workers, such as disabled workers according to their diagnosis and disabilities, young people who specially protected by regulations, and pregnant women. With a view to ageing of the population, special attention will be paid to senior workers in order to avoid additional burdens, leading to premature retirement, or in order to adjust their workplaces in such a way that it is possible to objectively think about staying at work and extension of the period of employment prior to retirement.

About Liable persons     The Pension and Disability Insurance Institute as the provider of pension and disability insurance requires certain data for the implementation of pension and disability insurance, the latter being used in the establishing of qualification conditions and benefit assessment when an insured event occurs.

It can help protect your valuable investment from dust, moisture and scratches, which can lead to costly repairs. A UV filter not only minimizes the bluish cast sometimes found under daylight conditions, but is also the best available protection against accidental damage to the front element of your lens.     Aside from that more-than-significant benefit, UV filters cut through some of the haze in the atmosphere rendering your photos clearer, sharper and more contrasty. For those who enjoy outdoor photography, especially distant vistas, a UV filter can produce a more distinct image by removing much of the blue tint normally associated with atmospheric haze.     A UV Protector is probably the most popular UV filter people use. As a lens protector, it should be left on at all times to guard against front element damage but also adds the benefit of rendering your images clearer.     Tiffen's ColorCore glass is produced through a process that entails permanently laminating the filter material in between two pieces of optical glass that are ground flat to tolerances of a ten-thousandth of an inch, then mounting them in precision aluminum rings.     Eliminates some of the Ultraviolet (UV) light which can register on film and videotape as a bluish cast that can obscure distant details     If desired, it can be left on the lens at all times for protection     Especially valuable as a general lens protector     Guards against fingerprints and scratches to the front element of your lens     Tiffen's ColorCore glass is sealed between two optical glass sheets. In this way, Tiffen can better control the various densities of their filters and thereby create more exact degrees of filtration. This process makes for greater accuracy of color as opposed to glass that is simply dyed and become subject to deviation during the dye process "

He lived in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and was married to the painter Metka Kra\u0161ovec.[5]     Contents: 1 Life 2 Work 3 Poetry collections translated in English 4 International reception 4.1 America 4.2 Slovenia 5 Prizes 6 References 7 External links 7.1 Profiles 7.2 Work 7.3 Interviews and review 7.4 2011 Symposium Life[edit] As members of Slovene minority in Italy (1920\u20131947), \u0160alamun\u2019s mother\u2019s family joined thousands of Slovenes who left their homes because of the forced Italianization and moved from Italy to Yugoslavia, where he was born in 1941 in Zagreb. His father\u2019s family came from Ptuj, where his grandfather had been a mayor.[6] After his family moved to Koper, the local high school teachers of French language and Slovene language made him interested in language. In 1960, he began to study art history and history at University of Ljubljana. His mother was an art historian,[7] his brother Andra\u017e is an artist, while his two sisters are Jelka a biologist and Katarina a literary historian. \u0160alamun died on 27 December 2014 in Ljubljana.[8][9]     Work[edit] In 1964, as editor of a literary magazine Perspektive he published his iconoclastic poem \u201cDuma \u201964\u201d (Thought \u201964), which was one of the reasons why Perspektive was banned and \u0160alamun was arrested by Titoist regime because one of its hard-liners, Ivan Ma\u010dek Matija, recognized himself in the (dead) cat from the poem (the Slovene word ma\u010dek means \u2018cat\u2019).[7] He spent five days in jail and came out something of a culture hero, but he refrained from including the poem in his first poetry book, which appeared in 1966 in a samizdat edition, full of absurdist irreverence, playfulness, and wild abandon.[6][10]     Poetry collections translated in English[edit] \u0160alamun has had several collections of poetry published in English, including The Selected Poems of Toma\u017e \u0160alamun (Ecco Press, 1998); The Shepherd, the Hunter (Pedernal, 1992); The Four Questions of Melancholy (White Pine, 1997); Feast (Harcourt, 2000), Poker (Ugly Duckling Presse), Row! (Arc Publications, 2006), The Book for My Brother (Harcourt), Woods and Chalices (Harcourt, 2008, translated by Brian Henry), There\u2019s the Hand and There\u2019s the Arid Chair (Counterpath, 2009), and On the Tracks of Wild Game (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2012). American poets that influenced him include Frank O\u2019Hara, John Ashbery and Walt Whitman.[1]     International reception[edit] America[edit] In July 1970, he was personally invited to exhibit his work at the MOMA.[11] \u0160alamun spent two years at the University of Iowa, including one year in the International Writing Program from 1971 to 1972, and lived for periods of time in the United States after that.[3] From 2005 to 2007 he taught at the University of Pittsburgh.     Slovenia[edit] For a time, he served as Cultural Attach\u00e9 to the Consulate General of Slovenia in New York. Literary critic Miklav\u017e Komelj wrote:[12] \u201c\u0160alamun\u2019s inventiveness with language has, indeed, never been more dynamic than in his most recent books. But in this dynamism there is also a monotone quality, which the poet makes no attempt to hide. It is as if this ecstasy resulted from spinning endlessly in a circle, like the whirling dervishes\u2014a religious order, incidentally, that was founded by the mystic Rumi, one of \u0160alamun\u2019s favorite poets\u2026.It seems that the intensity of \u0160alamun\u2019s language lies precisely in the endless insistence of its pulsation.\u201d     Prizes[edit] \u0160alamun won a Pushcart Prize, as well as Slovenia\u2019s Pre\u0161eren Fund Award and Jenko Prize. \u0160alamun and his German translator, Fabjan Hafner, were awarded the European Prize for Poetry by the German city of Muenster. In 2004, he was the recipient of Romania\u2019s Ovid Festival Prize.[13] "

The Slovenian Theatre Institute operates as the central Slovenian theatre museum and thus continues the tradition of its predecessor, which was founded in 1952.     In terms of formal arrangements, content, and space distribution, the museum is divided into several parts: the iconotheque, which holds the collection of visual theatre materials: scene photographs, scene set and costume designs, theatre programs and posters, artistic materials, etc.; the theatre archive, which holds all the written heritage: personal legacies and manuscripts of theatre creators, as well as other forms of written materials; the audio collection and video archives, which holds audio and video recordings; the specialized theatre library, which holds the entire collection of Slovenian theatre works, and the department for educational theatre programs, which is aimed at children, youth, adults, families and vulnerable groups.     Some of the most cherished artifacts in the museum are certain manuscripts and letters of the grandest creators of Slovenian theatre, such as Ivan Cankar, some statues and portraits of Slovenian theatre elite, as well as creations by prominent artists, such as scene designs by Avgust \u010cernigoj, the founder of constructivism, one of the best-known representatives of the historical avant-garde in Slovenian fine arts.     With its permanent exhibition, In Pursuit of Theatre. From the Jesuits to Cankar, the museum presents the first 400 years of Slovenian theatre history, from the theatre in the Reformation period to the works of Ivan Cankar. The permanent exhibition is sometimes replaced by temporary current exhibitions, such as the 2017 exhibition in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Dramatic Society in Ljubljana. The museum also has some traveling exhibitions \u2013 the exhibitions on Ignacij Bor\u0161tnik is currently set up at his birthplace in Cerklje na Gorenjskem.

In 2019, the Ljubljanica River project received the UNESCO designation for Best Practices of Underwater Cultural Heritage. Its objective was to protect, preserve, and present the heritage, but also to provide maximum accessi\u00adbility, and thereby create long-term sustainable devel\u00adopment in the local, national and global context. Ljubljanica River Exhibition is dedicated to the natural and cultural heritage of the Ljubljanica River basin and is located in the town of Vrhnika, where this fascinating river has several of its many springs. The interactive exhibition has been designed to encourage the public to actively participate in strengthening the common responsibility for heritage. By following various methods of communication each age and interest group is addressed. Programs are presented in the tourist offer of the Ljubljana Tourism.     Established in 2016, this modern exhibition is managed by the City Museum of Ljubljana.

Vrhnika Cultural center     In 2014 the premises of a former leather factory (IUV Vrhnika) opened its doors as the new Vrhnika Cultural Centre. While its upper floors host a library and a part of the local primary school, most of the ground floor is dedicated to the exhibition, which is spread across some 800 square meters.     Cultural center is located at the edge of Vrhnika center, next to regional road that connects Ljubljana \u2013 Postojna. Parking place is in front of the building.     About the exhibition     Ljubljanica River Exhibition represents cultural and natural heritage of Ljubljanica river and 3 worlds the river defines \u2013 underground karst world, world of the river bed and the world developted on river banks.     Story of the exhibition starts with short presentation of Ljubljanica river basin, karst and Ljubljana marches region with geological evolvement of the area. Through chronologically presented stories we get to know the Mesolithic and prehistoric settlements, the Roman period and the Early Middle Ages, up to and including modern history. Throughout this time Ljubljanica river had a very important role as the main traffic route in the area and source of energy for mills and sawmills.

Novo spleti\u0161\u010de: http:\/\/au.ung.si     Welcome to the archived website of School of Arts UNG 2010-2020! New website: http:\/\/au.ung.si\/en     Domov \/ HiLoVv - Hidden Live(r)s of Venice on Video     HiLoVv - Hidden Live(r)s of Venice on Video     After two months of research-based script development about the \"Hidden LIve(r)s of Venice\", on November 21 2011 students from three universities and several countries met in the floating city to produce 6 short documentaries about Venice, its interesting professions and personalities..., all under the mentorship of the renowned film director, professor Rajko Grli\u0107. The films were first shown at the end of the workshop with the presence of the portrayed persons at the University of Nova Gorica premises in Venice, at the ex Convento dei Servi di Maria, Sant\u2019Elena, while the final versions premiered at the screening in Ljubljana within the University of Nova Gorica School of Arts semester show on January 10 2012. The films are now in finalization for distribution.     HiLoVv Project Background     We will take a look at Venice from a different perspective, filter it through academic research and documentary film production. Students and mentors from three universities join to make 5 short documentaries about Venice, its people, their lives, the water...     The (Erasmus Intensive) programme under the title\"Hidden Live(r)s of Veniceon Video\"(HiLoVV) intends to revive the invisible and peripheral actors and narratives of a seemingly decaying urban tissue \u2013 Venice. By discovering the city\u2019s inner life through academic research and audio-visual representation of urban spaces, and through creative interactions with its everyday inhabitants, teachers and students are going to develop specific skills and knowledge within the interdisciplinary combined thematic areas of audiovisual techniques and (multi)media production, historical and (urban) archaeology, including cultural as well as social studies. Besides giving a unique and novel intercultural and interdisciplinary academic experience to the primary users, the secondary-user-centred aim of the project is to eventually offer a \"social catharsis through video\" to the immediate (academic and non-academic) audiences by featuring the 5 films (as major creative outputs) on site, regionally, and perhaps even globally. Contrasting the \u201chi\u201d and the \u201clow\u201d research and production paradigms \u2013 somewhat mirroring the two disparate layers of Venice\u2019s social reality \u2013 the specific pedagogical objective is to develop the key competence of a future film artist or video producer: to focus on small people as filters (the \u201cliver\u201d metaphor!) and carriers of \u201chidden\u201d narratives, discovering Venice (repeatedly anew) \u2013 or indeed any other \u201chistorically marked\u201d urban space \u2013 as a living urban tissue, reaching far beyond a mere historical scenery, a tourist landmark or a cultural business setting. In a broader project objective, the IP is to present a strong case of research-based media-production didactics, with a strong public impact and an innovative interdisciplinary outreach and strong ICT-based (blended) approach. The primary target groups of the programme include students, teachers and mentors, but also architects, urban sociologists, historians, conservators, and related (interdisciplinary oriented) scholars. Thesecondary target groups spread out onto all temporary as well as stationary urban inhabitants and \u201cusers\u201d of Venice, as well as the regional and trans-regional (global) public, reached via the distribution of the produced films.The main activities of the programme revolve around the gradual (didactically dissected) process of filmic video-production, supported by analytic remote as well as on-site research (urban sociology, architecture and history) as well as including manifold interactions with local inhabitants and other \u201cusers\u201d of the city. An important part of the project focuses around the dissemination activities covering on-site as well as trans-regional screenings and (exploitation-motivated) discussions, as well as fostering academic and non-academic (socially divergent) discourse on-site and on-line. The main learning outcomes envision students to: (specifically) - learn to research and produce in realistic and site-specific media production setting - master film and video production in blended (remotely connected) settings - develop site-specific preproduction, production and postproduction methods and work-styles in the realm of film and video production - develop a critical and (post)modern sociological perspective on cultural heritage, architecture and urbanism (generally) - develop interdisciplinary collaboration skills and team work ethics - learn to creatively collaborate trans-disciplinary, trans-culturally and via ICT - develop interdisciplinary competence in creative production settings - develop intercultural and interdisciplinary discursive competence Expected project outputs are: > 5 items of 7-10 minute short films of significant conceptual and aesthetic value (at least 2 promoted to international festivals and platforms), Supported by - 2 internal screenings on site (Venice) - 1 public screening on site (in Venice, with discussion) - 3 off-site screenings at partner universities (Graz, Rijeka, Ljubljana) - 3 international conference reports or presentations (at least one local) - 9 secondary screenings across the region (partner networks, festivals) - Intensive web dissemination (feature presentations ePlatform vsu.ung.si ) > new course curriculum, incl. complete instructional design and methodology > teaching & learning materials compendium (paper & online materials) > e-newsletter and press releases > 3international conference reports or presentations > a \u201cLessons Learned\u201d report Consortium partners: School of Arts University of Nova Gorica Academy of Applied Arts University of Rijeka Contemporary Arts Institute, Architecture and Media Institute, Graz Technical University "

This workshop will focus on the business and market impacts of some of the key cognitive radio and cognitive networks solutions currently being developed by the industry and the E3 Project. The event will feature an introductive session with official presentation from European Delegates, then dedicated sessions focusing on business and regulatory perspectives, technical concepts and solutions, and standardization and exploitation roadmaps. Participation to the day programme of the workshop is free of charge, but prior registration is required.     The purpose of this conference is to facilitate the exchange of ideas on the topic of computational creativity in a cross-disciplinary setting. It will bring together people from AI, Cognitive Science and related areas such as Psychology, Philosophy and the Arts who research questions related to the notion of creativity as it relates to computational systems. This focus on creativity in the context of computational systems has the potential for increasing innovation in existing fields of research as well as for defining new fields of study.     Israel's Nobel winner: People called me a dreamer Israeli scientist Ada Yonath, a leading researcher in the structural biology field, was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday, the Nobel committee in Stockholm announced.     The European Commission today called on Europe's information and communication technologies (ICT) industry to outline by 2011 the practical steps it will take to become 20% more energy efficient by 2015. ICT equipment and services alone account for about 8% of electrical power used in the EU and about 2% of carbon emissions. But using ICT in a smart way could help reducing energy consumption in energy-hungry sectors such as buildings, transport and logistics, and save 15% in total carbon emissions by 2020. The Commission recommends that the ICT sector adopts bold energy efficiency targets by 2011. It also asks EU countries to agree on common specifications for smart metering by the end of 2010.     This event will cover topics such as the European Digital Agenda for 2020; the EU Telecoms Framework Review; copyright; Commission state aid proposals; developments in next generation access policy; regulating in a bundled environment and the digital dividend. Workshops will also focus on data protection, state aid, net neutrality and telecoms issues in Eastern Europe.     Creativity plays an important role in developing intelligent computational systems, it is less clear how to model, simulate, or evaluate creativity in such systems. In other words, it is often easier to recognize the presence and effect of creativity than to describe or prescribe it. The purpose of this conference is to facilitate the exchange of ideas on the topic of computational creativity in a cross-disciplinary setting.     The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. Presenters are leaders in their respective fields, representing industrial, academic and government communities. Leading researchers present their current work, while special sessions focus on the role of women in today's technology fields, including computer science, information technology, research and engineering. Past Grace Hopper Celebrations have resulted in collaborative proposals, networking, mentoring, and increased visibility for the contributions of women in computing.     Two EU-funded projects, ICT-WEB-PROMS and WINS-ICT are jointly organising a \"Training and networking workshop for WB-EU research cooperation in ICT for Learning and eLearning\". The workshop will be organised in the frame of the international event \"4th Balkan Conference in Informatics-BCI 2009\" in Thessaloniki, Greece on 18 September, 2009. Draft agenda of the workshop.     In the midst of the economic crisis, the ICT sector is still growing! It is now the time to prepare for the future and ensure that when the crisis is over, the sector will have the necessary resources to respond to new challenges. At end of the mandate of Commissioner Reding, this gender workshop aims to take stock of the progress made and present new initiatives and actions. Brainstorming sessions are also organised to work towards setting up a new agenda for Women in ICT. Commissioner Reding will launch the Directory of Women in ICT, and interactive platform which brings together all relevant initiatives and information as well as provides a European network of women in the sector. The Commissioner will also present the new signatories of The Code of Best Practices for women in ICT. Participation in the Workshop is free of charge but there is a limited number of places. "

The herbarium data are completely digitized, some of herbarium sheets are photographed while (for the moment) web browsing (metadata in Slovene) is available for about half of the specimens.     Collection description: About 6000 earlier manuscript music works survived in the territory of the present-day Slovenia. These, together with a number of extant earlier music prints, now form the general fund of the national early music heritage in Slovenia. Old music manuscripts stored in archives at various locations throughout the area of Slovenia were first inventorised at the Institute of Musicology in the form of a loose-leaf catalogue, containing around 1500 units. In 1993 the Institute joined the international documentation-musicology project RISM (R\u00e9pertoire international des sources musicales), based in Frankfurt-am-Main, which collects and presents such kinds of materials on an international basis within the series A I (Music Prints before 1800) and A II (Music Manuscripts 1600\u20131850). For this purpose a regional committee of RISM (the regional group for the inventory of manuscripts, seated at the Institute of Musicology) was founded in 1993 for the Republic of Slovenia. Since then the members of the Institute have continued to catalogue these materials within the most up-to date computer systems, and supplement documentation with additional contents. The results of the RISM project are accessible online: http:\/\/opac.rism.info. The work for RISM has no special financing and is performed as part of the infrastructure programme of the Institute of Musicology, as part of projects and program, and is at times supported by state and municipal grants.

The Editorial Board brings together academics and researchers from different European countries, who seek to promote a vigorous dialogue between scholars in various fields both central and related to scientific enquiry in education.     Articles accepted for publication in JEE should address an important, up to date issue in education, apply appropriate research methodology, and be written in a clear and coherent style. Accepted articles should make significant contributions to the field. In addition, JEE accepts articles which promote advances in education from closely related fields, such as cognitive psychology, child development, applied linguistics and others. JEE does not publish articles that have appeared elsewhere or have been concurrently submitted to or are already under consideration for publication in other journals. The languages accepted for the papers eligible for publication in JEE are Slovene and English.

IMPORTANT NOTICE     Dear patients,     With the phasing-out of measures at the national level and the order of the Ministry of Health on temporary measures in the field of health care in view of containment and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, Community Health Centre Ljubljana has gradually begun increasing the scope of available health care services. Given the current epidemiological situation, from the point of view of safety of patients and medical staff alike, caution is still required, as well as the use of personal protective equipment and taking all the measures necessary to prevent corona virus infection.     Check-up with a GP and all other activities at the Community Health Centre Ljubljana are only possible after a prior appointment and consultation with the medical staff (over the phone or via e-mail). Your GP will assess your medical condition and reach a professional decision about any necessary treatment. The assessment can be made via e-mail, over the phone, or directly through a medical check-up.     If you have symptoms and show signs of COVID-19, your GP will refer you over the phone for swab testing and\/or a check-up at a COVID clinic, therefore never visit the health centre unannounced.     In the event of a life-threatening condition, call 112 immediately.     For your scheduled appointment, please arrive at the health centre no more than 5 minutes before the appointment.     At the entrance to the health centre, disinfect your hands and put on a surgical mask; wear the mask at all times for the duration of your visit.     Please observe a personal safety distance of at least 1.5 metres in all areas of the health centre.     On the day before your check-up, you should receive a call from the medical staff, who will check your medical and epidemiological condition by means of a questionnaire. It is advisable to print out and fill in the Questionnaire for the assessment of medical condition before treatment in the outpatient clinic at home, and bring it with you for your scheduled appointment.     Only healthy persons should come for a check-up. If a person falls ill, we kindly ask them to inform us of the fact and so waive their appointment time to somebody else.     ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES (PRESCRIPTIONS, SICK LEAVE ...)     All administrative services, such as issuing prescriptions for chronic therapy, referrals for check-ups, orders for medical devices, at the discretion of the GP possibly also sick leave, are performed remotely over the phone or, most preferably, by e-mail. When contacting us via e-mail, please state your name and surname, date of birth, Health Insurance Card number and the telephone number where you can be reached.     ENTERING THE HEALTH CENTRE     With the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the population, entering the Community Health Centre Ljubljana is limited and runs exclusively through the triage point. We ask all patients entering the health centre to provide the nurse with ACCURATE and TRUE information about their health condition, possible visits to high-risk areas and any close contact with infected persons. Providing untrue information means endangering one\u2019s own health and everyone else\u2019s.     WEEKENDS, PUBLIC HOLIDAYS AND NIGHT-TIME     On weekends, public holidays and at night, the paediatric emergency first-aid service (PNMP) and adult emergency first-aid service (SNMP) run in an unchanged manner. In case of symptoms suspected of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, cold, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting), make an appointment over the phone and do not visit the emergency service unannounced.     Before seeking emergency medical help, consider whether a check-up is necessary or whether you can wait for the workday to call your personal or a substitute practitioner.

        "text":" The RFID smart card management application for the hotel access control     Robert Kreslin (2011) The RFID smart card management application for the hotel access control. EngD thesis.     Abstract     In this thesis we wanted to present the project that was made for a smaller hotel in Nova Gorica. The goal was to create an application for managing access control according to customer's wishes as well as to introduce the system into the existent infrastructure. The first step was to define what access control actually means. In broad terms it is divided into RFID \u2013 radio-frequency identification and biometric identification. Both have their strengths and their weaknesses. Next step was choosing the right tools to develop the application for managing access control. We picked Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and Microsoft .NET framework using C# programming language. We analyzed the customer's requirements, defined the functional and non-functional requirements and set up a database. The most demanding part was of course developing the application, studying the hardware and how to communicate with it. We chose the hardware created by IDTECK, which has been at the forefront of manufacturing and developing access control hardware for more than 20 years. Their products are moderately priced and they provide software developers with the SDK development kit that allows the developers to upgrade their solutions according to customer's wishes. The thesis thus offers an overview of the development of an application for managing smart RFID card, made to suit the customer's wishes. We created an application that offers more than access control, enabling an overview of its users i.e. hotel guests as well as automatically disabling the users after a set date, which is something that access control hardware does not offer without a software solution. While researching various options we learned many details of access control and learned a lot about developing applications in Microsoft Visual Studio environment. In development we learned that there are many various other useful functions that access control allows, from calculating presence to timetables of working time and along with that an automatic calculation of the working hours.

EngD thesis.     Abstract     The amount of data recorded in various computer systems is increasing rapidly, therefore it is important to know how to interpret and organize them correctly. With the increase of the quantity of data, the need for faster processing is increasing as well, since calculated final information is irrelevant if it is delivered to the final actor in the computer system too late. By the time of writing this diploma thesis, graphics processing units have developed to the point where they enable not only specialized computer graphics manipulation but also general-purpose data processing. The test includes tests of two different applications on two operating systems. The application of a travelling sales representative is presented as an example of a display of pure processing power of processors, and the two modules for geoinformation system as an example of a genuinely useful application.

        "text":" After returning to Bishkek for the second time since the revolution, it is clear to me that the interim government has made progress in returning a sense of stability to Kyrgyzstan. Life in the capital seems to be calm; the outlook seems brighter.     But much work remains to be done. The country\u2019s interim rulers, who took power when former President Askar Akayev fled Bishkek last month, need to restore public confidence in the political process by fully embracing democracy. A step-by-step approach is the best available option for ensuring a safe transition to democracy and economic prosperity in this Central Asian republic. At the same time, political pressure should be applied on the new government to ensure that they honor their commitment to the democratic process.     The first priority is obviously the upcoming July 10 presidential election. In order to be legitimate, the election must be free and fair, and above all transparent. Irregularities at this point would seriously compromise Kyrgyzstan\u2019s territorial integrity and internal stability. I would not rule out the possibility of another outbreak of violence in Kyrgyzstan if the transition is not inclusive and democratic.     A free and fair presidential election is a fiction unless we can ensure that the right of equal participation for all candidates. It is not clear that Kulov, a former Bakiyev backer and arguably the most popular political personality in Kyrgyzstan today, will run for the presidency; nor can we be sure at this point that he will be treated as an equal candidate. At the same time, we can\u2019t speak of a free and fair election if we can\u2019t keep corruption and organized crime out of post-revolution politics. Today one can\u2019t avoid noticing that both are a serious problem. We hear that the south of the country is still overrun by drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and organized crime syndicates. This degree of lawlessness is a matter of great concern. The OSCE, in helping monitor the elections, can help ensure that these disturbing developments don\u2019t stand in the way of a free and fair presidential election.     In the post-election period, the priority should be on restoring law and order, and rebuilding Kyrgyz security forces. The police and security structures must be streamlined, and the loyalty of the police force aligned to the state. It is impossible to have a functioning order, let alone a democracy, without the means to enforce the rule of law.     The EU, the U.S., and Russia should all help the Kyrgyz government with the equipment and training of their security forces. The OSCE is well positioned to coordinate this process. It is in the interest of all to have a functioning security structure in Kyrgyzstan. Restoring control over the southern provinces would be a step in the right direction. There is an urgent need to help the Kyrgyz develop a proactive counter- organized crime and counter-terrorism initiative.     However, we should not confuse security with authoritarian rule. Security reforms have to be pursued hand-in-hand with constitutional reforms. It is simply absurd to think that democracy has to be compromised for security. Democracy is the best long-term security policy.     The authorities in Bishkek will no doubt also have to pursue economic reforms and build infrastructure and human capacity. Constructing a national development plan\u2014as is customary for EU candidate states\u2014would be of value. Such an approach would help define priorities and assess the level of domestic capacity to pursue legislative, legal and economic reforms in Kyrgyzstan. But one thing is clear: Economic prosperity in Kyrgyzstan can be assured in the long run only through the creation of a vibrant small and medium size enterprise sector. SMEs are the hart of a modern economy.     If things move in a well-planed way, with well defined short-term goals, we will succeed in making the democratization of Kyrgyzstan irreversible. However, we should not lose sight of the big picture. Events in Kyrgyzstan have opened a window of opportunity for the spread of democracy, human rights, and economic prosperity throughout the Central Asian region. This is what the OSCE is about. Let\u2019s seize this opportunity.     As we in Europe and elsewhere discuss democratic and economic reforms with the countries of the Middle East, and with countries in the Caucuses, it is only realistic to also develop a grand strategy for the future of Central Asia. The EU would be better off with a comprehensive regional approach for Central Asia. A purely bilateral approach, it seems to me, is deficient at this point.     Dr. Dimitrij Rupel is foreign minister of Slovenia and Chairman-in-office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. "

It refers to a set of techniques and processes used to repair some specific areas of a vehicle in a short time.     Some time ago, minor damages on vehicles required several days of intervention and high costs if compared to the nature of the damages.     The SMART materials and techniques put an end to these interventions and offer faster, cost-efficient and higher quality solutions. Scratches, dings & dents are considered SMART repairs.     Traditional repair vs. SMART     The traditional way of repairing dings, dents and scratches would often involve a lot of time spent disassembling and reassembling and definitely a request for a courtesy car for the customer, making it inconvenient and time-consuming for both the customer and the repair shop.     You can use SMART product techniques to increase customer satisfaction. Compared to conventional repairs, SMART offers high standard repairs at lower costs and on a same-day basis. Meaning it is less expensive and more convenient for the customer.     Entwickeln Sie mit Uns. Werden Sie unser Partner.

Natural, safe and healthy School kids wool felt slippers Ursanina are made of 100% wool felt. Wool's exceptional properties are making your child\u2019s feet cool and not overheat. They are equally comfortable and pleasant worn barefoot or wearing them with socks. Wool felt slippers are highly recommended for kids that suffer from excessive sweating and fungal infection.     For extra safety, 2 non-slip natural rubber patches are added to the sole.     Style and design     Children can choose between various color combinations and two models: princess style with flowers or butterflies for girls and playful ones with decorative patches for boys.     Sizing In case you are unsure about the size, measure your kid's foot and search for the right size in our sizing chart. Dimensions in centimeters represent the length of the foot. Measure the foot length by making your child stand on a piece of paper and outline their foot, holding a pencil in a horizontal position. Please watch this video for detailed instructions. The outline should be precise as a few millimeters smaller or larger outline may result in size difference. Then measure the outline from toe to heel and verify which number corresponds to the length.     SIZES     Boys 24-38     Girls 24-37     If your kid's foot is bigger than our available sizes, you can check out our adult models or order the custom shaped slippers here. "

Collection description: About 6000 earlier manuscript music works survived in the territory of the present-day Slovenia. These, together with a number of extant earlier music prints, now form the general fund of the national early music heritage in Slovenia. Old music manuscripts stored in archives at various locations throughout the area of Slovenia were first inventorised at the Institute of Musicology in the form of a loose-leaf catalogue, containing around 1500 units. In 1993 the Institute joined the international documentation-musicology project RISM (R\u00e9pertoire international des sources musicales), based in Frankfurt-am-Main, which collects and presents such kinds of materials on an international basis within the series A I (Music Prints before 1800) and A II (Music Manuscripts 1600\u20131850). For this purpose a regional committee of RISM (the regional group for the inventory of manuscripts, seated at the Institute of Musicology) was founded in 1993 for the Republic of Slovenia. Since then the members of the Institute have continued to catalogue these materials within the most up-to date computer systems, and supplement documentation with additional contents. The results of the RISM project are accessible online: http:\/\/opac.rism.info. The work for RISM has no special financing and is performed as part of the infrastructure programme of the Institute of Musicology, as part of projects and program, and is at times supported by state and municipal grants.

        "text":" Ulica Rutli \/ Rutlistrasse     04.12.2006 | The \u0160kuc Gallery, December 5th-10th, 2006 Concept by CONA.SI: Brane Zorman and Irena Pivka Tuesday, December 5th at 8 PM: Opening at the \u0160kuc Gallery. Running until December 10th, 2006. A school in the Berlin district of Neukolln, where the majority of inhabitants are immigrants was in the spring of this year in the media spotlight. The board of teachers sent to the senate a letter requesting that the school should be shut down, as they were unable to control the situation any more. They lost charge of the students. Control was seized by the students, mainly descendants of Turkish and Arabic immigrants. According to media reports, the discontented youngsters were aggressive. They were labelled as the rowdiest students in Germany. The authorities reacted very late, only when the situation was beyond a pivotal point. They had to send the police to the school and promise greater assistance to the teachers. The Senate refused the request for closing the school. The R\u00fctli School is not the only school in Germany with such problems. Among the issues, which need to be addressed are the functioning of the educational system and problems with the integration of second generation immigrants. The debate moved from the school to the German parliament. The German situation was in the spotlight of all media sectors also due to the events in France in the autumn of 2005. The public became aware of the serious threat of violence by the discontented inhabitants of these ghettoized areas. The situation in Berlin has calmed down for now. Apparently! But for how long? How did R\u00fctli Street look this September at the beginning of the new school year?     Accompanying events A simultaneous presentation of two projects with the same theme and similar name: cona.si and Cona Fu\u017eine. -Thursday, December 7th at 7 PM A presentation of Cona Fu\u017eine at the \u0160kuc Gallery.

With precise 3D scanning of the original and creation of functional CAD model we provided them with data for production of replacement.     The customer has presumed problems with excessive warpage in the stage of tool design. The material is PA66 with 30% of glass fibers. With the help of advanced injection moulding analysis we predicted the trend and values of warpage and thus successfully eliminated the problems.     Our client has planned a single phase deep drawing process for the presented case, however several doubts about manufacturability arose. The conducted analysis has cleared all doubts.     We made a comparative study between experimentaly and numerically determined strength of a fibre reinforced product, which yielded extremely good match of the results from both methods. "

But, on the other hand, some say that the floods do a great job, cleaning the city...     Every day, Venice seems to be invaded by aliens. Strange ones, in big space ships (although sailing the water). They are quiet during the day, but just before the sunset, they start to move and travel in a procession through the Giudecca canal.

        "text":" At the lower end of the superior quality wines pyramid \u2013 though differences across, including the top, are practically negligible \u2013 Sauvignon Blanc is well suited to predicate making. The rule of thumb is that the higher the predicate, the more it starts losing its varietal character which starts making way for botrytis and over-ripe notes. Not always, though, and especially not in Sauvignon Blanc, which often surprises with its apparently sturdy and resilient characteristic aromas. It develops a beautifully shimmering colour of aged gold, showing hints of dry hay, paprika, peppermint, carob and tropical fruit on the nose. Characteristically varietal, then, with botrytis ripeness in the background. Due to the staple Sauvignon acidity, which makes the wine go down smoothly despite the sugar, it'll hold on for years to come.     Sommelier recommends     Food pairing: A selection, a challenge. Looking for the best fit between food and wine, in this case both from sweet domains, the palate must sense the flavours together so that the dish doesn't overpower the wine or vice versa, but a melody instead plays out harmoniously in the mouth, both parts contributing to a whole greater than their sum. You can even try and match the specific aromas, paralleling the peppermint, carob and tropical fruit hints of the wine with mint, carob and tropical fruits in a dessert.

June \u2013 26. July 2016     The partnership between Clean Feed Records and the Jazz Festival Ljubljana dates back to 2011, when the label\u2019s first artists were programmed by the Festival and a new collection, named Ljubljana Jazz Series, was premiered in the Clean Feed catalogue, revealing outside its borders some of the most important Slovenian musicians, such as Kaja Draksler, Cene Resnik, Igor Lumpert and Dre Hocevar, besides the work of a very special big band, EMJO.     This cooperation between a festival taking place in Slovenia and a record company from Portugal, two countries positioned at the opposite ends of the European continent, is not strange when we consider the mindset of both enterprises. The Jazz Festival Ljubljana and Clean Feed follow the same philosophy: they think and act globally, managing to export the best music being created in the two nations while bringing music from the rest of the world into their territories.     This year, Clean Feed is celebrating its 15th anniversary, with 400 titles released, a distribution circuit comprising 13 countries and the unexpected, yet very deserved, achievement of being acknowledged by specialised publications like All About Jazz New York and New York City Jazz Record, along with organisations like the Jazz Journalists Association, as the best international jazz record company since 2007 and 2008, respectively.     The quality of the recorded music of a fair share of the biggest names working in jazz, along with always new provocative approaches emerging in the four corners of the planet, is the cause of that success, yet this music would remain unheard without a good marketing strategy and a solid image for each product. In this aspect, the graphic design of the CDs and vinyl records Clean Feed release is crucial.     This exhibition displays some of that cover art, more than once distinguished by international prizes. These are works by Rui Garrido, the designer of the first 100 releases, and Travassos, responsible for the last 300 titles published and who is also their illustrator.     Enjoy and feel invited to do your own thing: together, we\u2019ll be able to fill the world with music and art, making it ever better.     Rui Eduardo Paes     Bio Travassos     Travassos was born Jorge Trindade in 1972 in Barreiro, on the outskirts of Lisbon, and spent his childhood travelling from city to city between Portugal and Spain. He graduated in Design and has a postgraduate certificate in Sustainable Design from Aveiro University.     During his studies, he worked in the Jazz section of the megastore of Valentim de Carvalho de Aveiro, he programmed the \u201cprojecto 70&Set\u201d evenings of the Cultural and Congress Centre of Aveiro, while in 2001 he founded the 1st Aveiro Jazz Festival. After finishing his studies, he spent a year in Barcelona working at the CDN \u2013 Competitive Design Network international agency.     Returning to Portugal, Travassos became part of Trem Azul and, since then, has shown full devotion to the company. In the past few years, he has focused on cover artwork and so far produced around 300 covers for Clean Feed.     Parallel to this, he is the founder and director of the Rescaldo and Muco Music Festivals. He is also responsible for Clean Feed\u2019s sub-label Shhpuma.     The Portuguese book label Chilli con Carne will soon be publishing a book containing his work.     The exhibition has been organised with the cooperation of Clean Feed Records, Cankarjev dom and NLB Gallery Avla and forms part of the accompanying programme of the 57th Ljubljana Jazz Festival.

Situated at a cultural crossroads, Slovenia has always been a place of high artistic achievements. Arts and culture have had a special position in the history of the Slovenian nation and have compensated for the lack of its own state and political institutions in the past. A rich cultural life and far-reaching institutions, organisations, and cultural societies are comparable to the most developed European countries. In Slovenia, you can experience amazing contrasts in the same day: a morning swim in the Adriatic, followed two hours later by skiing below Alpine peaks, then an adventurous discovery of Karst subterranean phenomena and an invigorating bath in a thermal spring; an encounter with history in a lively mediaeval city and, not far away, a more solitary stroll through primeval forests or undulating, winegrowing hills.www.slovenia.si Introduction to Slovenia www.slovenia.info     Ljubljana     The capital of Slovenia is located in the centre of the country, about an hour's drive from the Alps and the Adriatic Sea. Ljubljana is a lively industrial, commercial, administrative, and cultural centre with a population of 300,000 people, of which 54,000 are students. With its cafes, restaurants, shops and galleries, the picturesque Old Town on the banks of the Ljubljanica River is an increasingly popular tourist attraction.

Customer reviews     Napi\u0161ite Va\u0161u Recenziju     The Ultralight 10x50 binoculars (New! with dielectrical)     The universal hiking and stalk hunting and twilight binoculars by DDoptics are available as the high luminosity 50mm version since April 2016. There are only a few binoculars models with this 10x50 design, as most of the manufacturers concentrate on models with 42mm objective diameter or offer the 8x56 night binoculars. But good 10x50 binoculars combine lots of positive characteristics. They are for example especially well suited for bird watching in bad lighting conditions and during twilight and night hunt. The Ultralight 10x50 are surprisingly bright and suitable until the last hunting light, and with 797g real midgets. The field of view of 101m of the Ultralight binoculars 10x50 by DDoptics is clearly superior to most other 10x50 binoculars on the market.     Small, light, handy and high-performance are the characteristics of universal hiking and stalk hunting binoculars. Of course the Ultralight also has to be watertight and sturdy. And these small binoculars are also just beautiful. The open bridge literally invites the hand to firmly grasp the tube and offers handiness and comfort. The coating of the prisms and lenses of the Ultralight binoculars with 50mm objective diameter have even been coated with a dielectrical. This ensures a bright and pleasant image and once the bincoulars are not needed anymore they disappear without further ado inside a jacket pocket. The small weight of barely 797g of the Ultralight binoculars never hampers. The best thing about these binoculars is that one likes to have them around.     Best suited for hunting and bird watching even during progressing twilight and night     In the mountains or at the North Sea, at minus 15 degrees Celsius or at 45 degrees Celsium in the desert. The watertight and nitrogen filled Ultralight 10x50 can do it all and still offers a good image. The binoculars were extensively tested during still hunting in late twilight and night, where they did surprisingly well. In comparison to our Nachtfalke Ergo 8x56 they did extremely well until late twilight, with the 10x magnification helping for better targeting. Only during the last hunting light the 8x56 could reach the advantage over the Ultralight 10x50 binoculars. Even we as product testers by DDoptics were positively surprised by the good night qualities of the Ultralight 10x50, as the product clearly exceeded our expectations.     Price-performance ratio is a priority!     With the Ultralight 10x50 we offer optics which can do everything one expects from such a midget. In this price category there are almost no open bridges to be found. The field of view of 101m and the convincing resolution can't even be reached by binoculars twice that price. All in all the Ultralight binoculars 10x50 belong to the most modern binoculars with extraordinary optics.     Sturdy workmanship for heavy outdoor use     The tubes are made of ultra hard and break-proof polycarbonate. All critical places like the eyecups and the \"kink\" are made of metal alloys.     Fine mechanics     The focussing wheels runs freely and without any play. Not too hard, not too soft, and it's easy to get to the \"acuity point\" during fine-adjustment. The diopter set underneath the right ocular is clearly and precisely adjustable. The eye cups have 4 changeable steps so that spectacle wearers as well as non spectacle wearers can adjust to the perfect and most comfortable eye distance. "

        "text":" Category: Windows Server     Well we already know that March was really black for Microsoft updates. I just want to mention few of them:     Exchange had remote code execution and a lot of organizations were hacked. Patch is already available. Look here for more info. Microsoft timeline is interesting on this exploit and is publicly available here or maybe take a look of the date of this post.     Windows DNS servers had also remote code execution vulnerability and also here are patches already available     Windows 10 had blue screen when trying to print on some printers     The latest one was les critical for system administrators, but when you ask helpdesk, they had a lot of work and they uninstall the latest update KB5000802. Anyway, this is a security update and it should not to be best practice to uninstall the latest update (but there is no other way). At the same time, if you want not to have the same problem the day after, you had to defer windows update in time \u2013 what is not a recommended way. From today, there is a patch also for the latest mistake. It is available on this link. Please install it and turn your updating process back on.     Sometimes, when you tried to open PST from Outlook, it can occur that PST is corrupted. Outlook will get restarted and it will try to repair PST, but it is not always successful and some PST can remain corrupted. At this point Outlook will try to repair PST always on start, but if the first attempt failed, it will fail also the second, third, \u2026 Outlook will try to repair this PST even in case you delete PST from disk. The reason is in registry key where Outlook record action to take and the last corrupted PST. Now that you know this, it\u2019s very simple to solve this problem: open regedit.exe, navigate to HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\PST and change the value of the key PromptRepair to 0. Start Outlook and it will open normally \u2013 without trying to repair the corrupted PST. If you still need to repair PST, you have to find software like Stellar Repair Tool for Outlook or something similar on internet.     Yes, in some cases this can be a problem. As is true, that if you are connected in remote to a computer, you can just press CTRL + ALT + END and start a new window in Task Manager, this becomes more difficult if you are remote connected in remote session. In This case this shortcut will not work. Well, the problem is pretty easy to solve: Run PowerShell as Administrator on some other computer and find the session ID with command: QUSER \/Server:ServerName You will see all active connections and here you will find also a SessionID for the connection that you want to kill. Now you know your SessionID and finaly you can kill the connection. This can be done in two ways: \u2013 As command in CMD: logoff Your_SessionID \/server:ServerName \u2013 In PowerShell: Invoke-RDUserLogoff -HostServer ServerName -UnifiedSessionId SessionID Well, now you lose your session and if you will connect to that server, you will have a new session with your CMD window opened.     If someone has a problem with activation of Windows server 2019 Standard Evaluation edition, maybe I can help someone with my post. When I tried to activate the server, I received the error code 0xC004F069. Searching for this code on internet, I received many explanations like problems with KMS server, not accessible thru internet and so one. Of course, no one of this errors was the right error and I had to do my research. The problem in this case is Evaluation edition and you have to solve this issue as first. To do this you have to change the scope of server using DISM command: DISM \/online \/set-edition:serverstandard \/productkey: N69G4-B89J2-4G8F4-WWYCC-J464C \/accepteula \u2013 this key is GVLK Key! This example is for Standard edition. Be aware that as product key you must use GVLK Keys! If you need to know to which edition you can change, use the command Dism \/Online \/Get-TargetEditions before you specify eddition in previous command After this (you will see a progress bar with installation) you need to reboot the server. When the server will come back, you can activate it with your key: Slmgr -ipk:YOUR-KEY Slmgr -ato Hope that I helped someone. Let me know.     If you are using HTML5 web site for remote apps and you have to change a certificate, you may expect some problems. This technology is pretty new and there are not so many posts on internet, so troubleshooting could be difficult. In addition, you have more technologies and this means more problems. I adopted HTML5 long time ago and everything worked fine for a long time. I have to say, that it was better that I expected. But now I have to change the certificate. Well, this is not a complicated job\u2026 or it is? The answer is yes, it is. I have changed my certificate as usual, form server manager. I tried to connect to website and everything was OK. Then I tried to launch an application and I got this error:     Wow, what to do now?! I remember that when I setup web client framework, I had to run PowerShell cmdlet to register the certificate. So, if I had changed the certificate, I have to register a new one \u2013 rerun PowerShell cmdlet \u2014\u2014 . This apparently didn\u2019t solve my issue because from my computer it seems the situation haven\u2019t change. But then a customer tried to work from a new computer and it worked! Why??? The reason was in cookies and cache files on the computer browser! Yes, you have to delete all cookies and cache files and (at least in my case) the webpage will work again.     About me     I am working in IT for more than 10 years, concerning most of my time with small companies. A result of this work is a good knowledge of problems and products used in that companies, like Windows Small Business Server, System Center Essentials, Windows OS ecc.

        "text":" 6m band is sometimes called \u201cmagic band\u201d. It has combined propagation properties of HF and VHF. When conditions are good, very long DXs are possible. Beside the sporadic E occurence some other requirements are essential. One of the most important pieces of equipment is good antenna. There is no shortcut for good performance in small package. Good antenna is big when lambda is long. For 6 meters, the antenna usually occupies about 3x3m floor area. Here\u2019s my implementation based on Ljubisa Popa \u2013 POP YU7EF design EF0604S.     1. Design and simulation     Target frequency bandis 50.0 \u2013 50.5MHz. The elements are 10mm aluminium tubes with simple dismounting and assembly using only basic tools usually present on field. My requirements is to use this antenna not only for stationary work, but also for mobile or even portable (SOTA) operation. The 3D design is shown in following figure:     free space dimensions for 10mm tubes are: R: 2.952 mm, Dr: 2.880 mm, D1: 2.752 mm and D2: 2.632 mm. Here are 3D models: STEP, IGES and Parasolid. I run few optimisation cycles with FEKO and realistic geometry. First preliminary results look promising (from left to right: E plane, H plane, radiation and SWR):     2. The construction and material selection     The construction is based on 20 mm square aluminium tubes, 10 mm aluminium tubes and 6 mm aluminium plates. The tubes could be cut few mm longer for fine tuning during antenna testing. Supporting construction is mad from 20 mm square tubes. I cut one long tube into half and join both parts together to have shorter components, just in case I decide to use this antenna during field day by car or during \/p operation. The antenna horizontal support is also made from 20mm square tubes. There are four additional aluminium profiles\/holders to assemble everything together (PDF Drawing: boomholder).     Holders for elements are produced from POM (Polyoxymethylene), which is sold under trade name Delrin and is intended for outdoor use. It is excellent plastics for CNC milling and other machining, like making threads. Ten holders are required for this antenna. Here is PDF drawing for the holder. I made the machining on my CNC mill from a little thicker material, which adds weight, but also strength. The 10 mm Delrin shuld be OK, too. Here are half finished parts:     The mounting holes were drilled and threaded later. Drill the 8mm hole at the base, followed with M4 thread all to the center hole as shown in PDF drawing and following cross section:     Now it\u2019s time to mill some aluminium. There are two types of plates where holders are mounted. One is smaller plate (pdf drawing: plate1) for reflector and two directors (three are required). The driven element has larger plate (pdf drawing: plate-driver) for double holders, because it is divided into two separated pieces. Finished parts should look like these (or better):     3. Elements     Antenna elements are divided at half. The central section is joined with 100 mm long aluminium rod (PDF Drawing: connectingRod). The connecting aluminium rod has two diameters: 8 mm and 7,8 mm, divided at the center. The aluminium tube for each element is first drilled to 8 mm using lathe. The rod is pressed inside the element tube with 8 mm diameter. The fit should be very tight. I pressed it using lathe tailstock. The rod is pressed only one half inside. The second half of the element should fit loose enough just to provide easy disassembly. Both halves are then equipped with plastic holders, tighten with screws from bottom side and assembled to the plates.     To finish part one of the assembly process I started my 3D printer to produce the cover for dipole connection: "

The physical characteristics, especially the shallowness and its semi-enclosed nature, make the Adriatic and Ionian Sea even more vulnerable to these threats. These problems highlight the need for global planning and management of coastal marine areas in the Adriatic-Ionian region.     The idea for the PORTODIMARE project is based on implemented projects (SHAPE, ADRIPLAN). The aim of the project itself is to continue the activities carried out so far in these projects and to develop a maritime spatial plan for the area of \u200b\u200bthe Adriatic-Ionian region.     The goal of the PORTODIMARE project is to create a common platform - the Geoportal, which will provide access to all informations, data and tools that are necessary and important to support the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and strategic maritime planning in the Adriatic-Ionian region. The platform will operate in full compliance with the policies and principles of the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and will support the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region- EUSAIR.     The project is divided on 4 main work packages:     M- Management     The work package includes the preparation of all acts and statutory documents, ongoing management of project activities, financial management, reporting and archiving and self-assessment of project results.     T1 \u2013 Geoportal design and development     The first work package includes the creation and development of a database for the Geoportal.     T2 \u2013 Geoportal testing and demonstration: towards the plan     The second work package include the testing and the demonstration of the Geoportal.     C-Communication     As part of the communication work package, the promotion of tools, good practices and the knowledge acquired in the implemented projects will take place.     The regional development center Koper will be actively involved in all project work packages through various activities. Within the T1 work unit, it will carry out individual activities such as the T1.2 activity, which aims to determine the data needed for maritime spatial planning and the use of the protocol on integrated coastal zone management in the Mediterranean.

The most common modules of this type of system and the process of their implementation within a company are then described. Because an implementation project may be very extensive and demanding, this thesis presents an application that supports ERP System implementation projects by providing better oversight. The application is accessible on the Internet and, depending on the level of the user, displays different data content on project development. The application stores all project data in one place, enabling management supervision over activities being carried out while ensuring project participants always remain precisely aware of their next task as well as of the deadline by which the task must be completed. In addition, the application stores all meeting minutes and records of other activities. In this way, the application assists in minimizing complications that could arise during project implementation as a result of a project participant not being aware of existing agreements, of his or her responsibilities or of the deadlines by which tasks must be completed.

        "text":" Grad Sne\u017enik     Sne\u017enik castle is situated near the Kozari\u0161\u010de village - about 2.5 km southern from the Lo\u017e (28 km ES from the Cerknica lake). Nearby the castle is the higest Slovenian mountin which is not in Alps - Sne\u017enik . The name \"Snowy mountain\" (Schneeberg - Sne\u017enik) was first mentioned in 1461 but the first written documents about the castle are from 1269. Interior from the 19th century is very well preserved. Beside the castle is a landscape park which is a part of the \"Sne\u017enik Castle Regional Park\". The castle is open for a public as a castle museum of the National museum of Slovena.     After a restoration completed in 2008, the romantic state-owned Sne\u017enik Castle in Notranjska, the only one in Slovenia with surviving authentic interiors, has again been open to the public. At a nearby strategic site on the edge of the Lo\u017e Valley, a stronghold was already built by the Romans. The lords of Sne\u017enik (= The Snowy one) are first mentioned in the 13th century. The castle's successive owners were members of eminent Carniolan noble families, the Lambergs, Scheyers, Raumschissls, Eggenbergs, Auerspergs and Lichtenbergs. In the 17th century a large part of Notranjska was governed from Sne\u017enik. The medieval stronghold was repeatedly refurbished, with renaissance and baroque features, including the surviving fetching beamed ceilings. Its present appearance dates from the latter half of the 19th century. After the estate with its immense forests had been bought in 1853 by a princely Saxon family of Sch\u00f6nburg-Waldenburg, the castle was converted into a hunting and holiday residence. In 1867 Prince George backed the foundation in the grounds of the first Slovenian forestry school. Rare animals were not hunted and the steam saw spurred the development of woodworking industry in the valley. The expertly managed property offered a range of jobs to the locals until the end of the second world war when the last caretaker Leon Schauta saved the building from destruction. A stroll through the four floors of the castle evokes the atmosphere of more than a hundred years ago. Rooms are equipped with genuine furniture and other household objects from the latter half of the 19th century. The drawing rooms and bedrooms of Princes Herman and Ulrich, of Princess Anne and the guest rooms are handsomely and comfortably fitted out with originally upholstered historicist seating suites and ornamental stoves. Walls are hung with family portraits, old photos and prints. Outstanding is the Egyptian room from the early 20th century. The piano, the billiard table and the theatre corner disclose the owners' pastimes. Gradually, an interesting collection of hunting trophies was assambled, notably the stuffed bear. In the lobby there are Roman tombstones and a large 1744 printed map of Carniola. Remarkable is a 17th century ornamental leather antependium from the neighbouring village church of \u0160marata. Temporary exhibitions are held in the stonefaced bailey area and a ground floor room is used for wedding ceremonies. Outside under the hanging wooden gangway is kept a dugout boat, such as were used by the locals to cross flooded grasslands. The imposing whitewashed castle, quietly reflected in the spring water of the pond alive with bleak, trout and ducks, is surrounded by a large, partly restored park with tree-lined walks and clearings. In the pleasant summer shade among the trees one might come across a statue of Diana. The countryside is breathtaking in any season, including in winter with enchanting mists dancing above frozen-over maddows. Right by the castle run two hiking routes, the European 6th and the local Krpan's route. The landscape is also great for biking and horse-riding. A few kilometres away is the stunning cave Kri\u017ena jama. Today Sne\u017enik Castle on the verge of vast pine-and-beech forests is far from noisy thoroughfares and an ideal point of departure for exploring the beautiful Karst countryside. From here woodlands spread out, to the south right up to the picturesque name-sake mountain of Sne\u017enik close to the Croatian border, and to the east to the ancient Ko\u010devje forests, forming one of the last remaining European massive woodland regions. This unique natural environment is home to a plethora of flora and fauna, from bears, boars, wolves and lynxes, to wild fowl, small game and deer.

        "text":" Surface Electromyograms     System Software Laboratory has rich and long-lasting experiences in processing of biomedical signals. The first activities in this field were initiated when the laboratory was established in 1989. At that time, the main focus was on the analysis of electrocardiograms (ECG). In collaboration with the Gorenje company from Velenje, Faculty of Electrical Engineering from Ljubljana, and Institute Jo\u017eef Stefan from Ljubljana, a special device called CardioA was developed for acquisition, monitoring and analysis of multi-lead ECG signals recorded during an exercise test. The device was clinically validated at the Hospital of Topol\u0161ica and in the Rehabilitation Centre at Krapinske Toplice, Croatia.     Later on, the analysis of needle and surface electromyograms (EMG) was addressed through fruitful contacts and project collaboration with other prominent bioengineering laboratories, especially with the Institut f\u00fcr Signal- und Informationsverarbeitung at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland, Laboratoire d\u2019Automatique de Nantes, France (today called Institute de Recherche en Communications et Cybernetique de Nantes), and LISiN at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. Current research activities deal mainly with the decomposition of surface EMG signals detected by high-density arrays of surface electrodes.     These pages describe briefly some of our recently developed surface EMG decomposition techniques, which are exemplified with their typical decomposition results. More consistent description of the presented methods can be found in corresponding papers (see the reference list at the end of this page). For clarity reasons, the problems of surface EMG generation, detection, and decomposition are also briefly outlined.     Electromyograms and their significance     Advanced medical diagnosing resides with precise information which can be obtained from the measured physiological data. When it comes to the neurophysiology, quantitative measures of neuromuscular degeneration and effectiveness of treatment are of paramount importance. Moreover, in order to support evidence-based medicine, a deeper understanding of the muscle alternations (neuropathies, pain, muscle weakness, etc.) and their relations to work conditions, immobilization and overtraining is required. Speaking about quantitative indicators of neuromuscular system condition, there is no real alternative to electromyogram (EMG) signals, i.e. the electrical signals traversing the neuromuscular system.     Human muscles comprise thousands of tiny fibres which, when electrically excited, contract and, at the same time, produce a measurable electrical potential, called action potential (AP). APs emerge at the neuromuscular junction about the middle of the muscle body, and propagate along the fibres to both directions towards the muscle tendons. The neural system, responsible for the activation of muscle fibres, conducts electrical pulses from the brain to the muscles. During voluntary muscle contractions the whole sequences of electrical pulses, so called innervation pulse trains (IPT) are transferred by the same motoneuron (Fig. 1). Fibres which are innervated by the same nerve contract synchronously (Fig. 2) and form a basic functional muscle unit, the motor unit (MU).     Fig.1: Schematic picture of human muscle with different Motor Units (MU).     Fig. 2: Schematic picture of individual motor unit with travelling Action Potentials (APs).     One of the most important, but also most challenging issues, still lacking the adequate robustness and reliability, is decomposition of EMG signals into their constituent components, i.e. to the motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) and to the innervation pulse trains (IPTs). Namely, measuring the electrical potential at an arbitrary position in space, the MUAPs from different MUs appear superimposed in both time and space, forming very complex patterns (Fig. 3). Moreover, the passive electric media surrounding the muscle fibres acts as a low-pass filter which decreases the MUAP amplitude and increases its duration.     On the other hand, reconstructed MUAPs and IPTs represent one of the most important quantitative measures of neuromuscular degeneration and effectiveness of motor rehabilitation. They are used in advanced research and clinical investigations concerning various neuromuscular pathologies, work-related disorders, and myoelectrical manifestations of fatigue, etc. Generation, acquisition and decomposition of multichannel surface EMG signals is schematically depicted in Fig. 4.     Fig. 3: Contributions from individual MUs (left), and their temporal summation (superimposition) as detected by the pick-up electrode (right).     Fig. 4: Schema of SEMG signals generation (left), acquisition (top) and decomposition (bottom right).     Decomposition of EMG signals: state of the art     The existing computer-aided EMG decomposition methods are mainly focused on the invasive intra-muscular EMG signals (Fig. 5). Decomposition techniques based on pattern recognition and clustering in the time domain, on spatial filtering, and on time-frequency and time-scale analysis, report controversial results and fail when a large number of components (MUAPs) become superimposed. Most recent pattern recognition techniques make use of graph theory and artificial intelligence to successfully cope with the complex superimposed MUAPs patterns. Unfortunately, their use is restricted to the invasive and painful needle EMG, to be performed by properly trained medical personnel in a hospital environment.     Surface electrodes offer numerous advantages when compared to the invasive needle ones:     there is no discomfort or tissue damaging,     there can be unlimited repetitions of tests with electrodes in exactly the same place,     surface electrodes eliminate the need for miniaturization and sterilization and are, hence, inexpensive,     SEMG gives global information about the muscle activity, and     tests can be delivered by technical personnel in the field.     The recent development of flexible high-density adhesive 2D arrays of surface electrodes opened the possibilities of recording up to a few tens or even hundreds of SEMG signals simultaneously. At the same time, with the increase of computer performance, more sophisticated and computationally complex separation techniques, capable of processing and combining the information from such large multichannel recordings, became feasible. However, although many attempts were made in the past no approach developed so far enables a complete and reliable reconstruction of IPTs out of the SEMG signals. The main reasons can be identified as follows:     Even at moderate muscle contraction levels, many MUs contract asynchronously producing highly complex interference patterns at the skin surface,     The filtering effects of the subcutaneous tissue suppresses the morphological information about the individual MUs,     At the skin surface, the contributions from other muscles not being under the clinical investigation have to be taken into consideration (muscle cross-talk).     Decomposition of surface EMG signals: techniques developed in SSL     Assumed Data model     SEMG recordings can be modelled as a multi-channel linear, time-invariant system, as long as they have been taken in stable, controllable, and stationary measurement session. This implies an isometric muscle contraction and avoiding of the appearance of fatigue-induced changes. Dealing with sampled multi-channel EMG recordings, the discrete, shift-invariant MIMO modelling is most feasible. Each source (channel input) in such MIMO system is considered a MU innervation pulse train triggering the muscle, while the system responses (channels) correspond to the MUAPs as captured by a spatial filter (pick-up electrodes). The individual EMG measurements represent the model outputs.     The shapes of system responses in the assumed MIMO system are of no importance. Hence, any property of MU (e.g. its depth in the muscle tissue, the number of fibres and their conduction velocities, etc.), as well as the properties of the detection system (the spatial filter used, inter-electrode distance, etc.) influencing the shapes of MUAPs can be modelled in the system responses.     Fig. 6: Assumed convolutive MIMO system with sources (IPTs), system responses (MUAPs), measurements, noise, and noisy measurements. The operation of convolution is depicted by rectangles, addition with circles.     The innervation pulse trains are typically modelled as a time sequences of delta pulses. This is a very coarse approximation because the pulses in neurons are actually action potentials and hence at least a few ms long. Moreover, they occupy more than two different values (when sampled with high-enough frequency) and can hardly be modelled as a true delta pulses. Nevertheless, only the MUs\u2019 responses (MUAPs) to innervation pulse trains are measured by the surface electrodes, while the shape of neuron potentials do not impact the shapes of MUAPs. Therefore, action potentials in a motor neuron can be conceptually replaced by true delta pulses. It should be stressed here that this \u201cconceptual replacement\u201d is nothing else but a very useful convention.     Theory behind the proposed SEMG decomposition approaches     1. Method based on time-frequency distributions     Time-frequency (TF) analysis is one of the most frequently used tools in the filed of signal processing. It also plays an important role in blind source separation, because it enables us to separate sources with Gaussian distribution. Although it is most frequently used for separation of multiplicative mixtures, it is becoming more and more important also when it comes to the separation of convolutive mixtures.     Very efficient approach to separation of multiplicative mixtures of independent nonstationary sources was introduced by A. Belouchrani and M. Amin [1]. Their method exploits the differences in energy locations of sources in time-frequency domain and is based on the joint diagonalization of spatial time-frequency distribution (STFD) matrices which are constructed from the time-frequency distributions of all possible pairs of measurements. Similar approach was also suggested for general convolutive mixtures of non-stationary signals [1, 2]. In [2], for example, convolutive mixtures were converted to multiplicative ones by simply adding delayed repetitions of measurements. Such a conversion also changes the number of sources which now form block diagonal STFD matrices. Hence, with joint block diagonalization [3] of observation spatial time-frequency distribution matrices several versions of each source can be retrieved, but only up to an unknown filtering effect [2].     Our time-frequency based SEMG decomposition approach is based on the work of A. Belouchrani and M. Amin, however, it additionally suggests the construction of diagonal source STFD matrices. These latter matrices are processed into a joint-diagonalization scheme (instead of joint block diagonalization), which provides an estimation of the system responses (MUAPs detected on different electrodes) and sources up to the scale factor and the phase shift. More details about the TF-based SEMG decomposition method can be found in [4].     2. W-slices and higher-order cumulants     The theory of higher-order statistics (HOS) has been well established, also in the field of MIMO systems. It has been shown that the system\u2019s responses can be deconvolved whenever the system\u2019s input can be modelled as an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.), zero-mean, random white signals. Although suffering from a very high computational complexity, HOS-based methods have many nice properties. They can be successfully applied when the number of sources highly exceeds the number of measurements, while the superimpositions of impulse responses do not hinder a thorough decomposition. Moreover, by being insensitive to all Gaussian random processes the cumulants of order higher than two are also inherently resistant to the Gaussian noise.     As already discusses ITPs are usually modelled as a sparse positive pulse sequences and cannot be strictly treated as i.i.d. white random signals. However, this does not corrupt the higher-order cumulants, as long as they are computed at the lags that do not exceed the minimum inter-pulse distance. In the case of biomedical signals, the minimum inter-pulse distance in ITPs exceeds the length of MUAPs. Therefore, when properly used, the theory of HOS can be applied to the SEMG signals.     HOS-based SEMG decomposition approach developed in SSL is implemented in two-steps. Firstly, a multivariate version of w-slice method is applied in order to extract coarse approximations of MUAPs. Secondly, these coarse estimates are refined by non-linear Newton-Gauss iteration.     Step 1: Coarse estimation of MIMO channels     Among various approaches having been proposed for MIMO system identification, we want to rely upon those with as little a priori information needed as possible. One of them is so called multivariate w-slice method [7]. Beside the minimum number of system channels to be modelled, the only additional information needed in this approach is about the values of the starting samples of system-channel responses.     Multivariate w-slice method is based on Barlett-Brillinger-Rosenblatt equation [6]. Firstly, a set of nonlinear equations is formed by comparing the model-based and the observation-based cumulant estimates. Afterwards, taking the casualty of multichannel SEMG signals into consideration, the system of non-linear equations is solved by applying the inverse of special weight matrix W to the causal part of properly formed cumulant matrix. The matrix W can be constructed out of anti-causal part of abovementioned cumulant matrix, as described in [8].     Step 2: Non-linear optimization     The first approximations of the system-channel responses can further be improved by iterative non-linear Newton-Gauss optimization. In each step of iteration the cost function is formed by fitting the model-based cumulant estimates to the observation-based cumulant estimates. Afterwards, the values of MUAP estimates are updated by Newton-Gauss formula and the model based cumulant estimates recalculated. This optimization procedure is repeated until the convergence is reached [8].     3. Convolution Kernel Compensation method     Convolution Kernel Compensation (CKC) method is a novel decomposition technique developed entirely in SSL. It exhibits a very low computational complexity and is suitable for real-time signal decomposition of both convolutive and multiplicative mixtures of pulse sources. In contrast with other decomposition techniques, the CKC method works well also when the number of active MUs is slightly underestimated, if the MU firing patterns partly overlap and if the measurements are noisy     Realizing it is much easier to estimate pulse sources than general mixing coefficients (MUAPs) the CKC method is based on a completely novel decomposition concept. Throughout its derivation we ignored all the information about the mixing process and focused strictly on the properties of pulse sources. In other words, we tried to cancel the interfering effect of the mixing process (MUAPs) and reconstruct the sources (IPTs) directly. This has at least two significant advantages. Firstly, estimation of mixing process is prone to both estimation errors and noise, and provides good quality results only if the given mixing process is well-conditioned. Secondly, estimation of mixing process is time consuming approach. Direct compensation of the mixing process will, hence, speed up the decomposition. Detailed description of CKC method can be found in [5].     Decomposition results     All SEMG decomposition techniques developed in SSL were tested on both synthetic and real SEMG signals. In the sequel, the simulation and experimental protocols are briefly described, along with some typical results of aforementioned decomposition techniques.     Synthetic SEMG signals:     The synthetic signals were generated by the advanced SEMG simulator built by the LISiN laboratory at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. The number of active MUs was set to 5, 10 and 20, respectively, while SNR ranged from 0 dB to 20 dB, in steps of 5 dB. In each simulation run the depth of MUs (uniformly distributed over [3,10] mm), their firing rate (normally distr. with mean and st. dev. of 15\u00b14Hz), the number of fibres (uniformly distr. over [50,300]), and conduction velocity (normally distr., 4 \u00b1 1m\/s) were randomly selected. The detection system with 1\u00d71 mm electrodes arranged in 10 lines and 5 columns was centred over innervation zone (columns aligned with the direction of fibres). Single differential recordings were sampled at 1024 Hz. The simulated signals are illustrated in Fig. 7. The results obtained by different decomposition techniques are exemplified in Figs. 8 \u2013 13.     Fig. 7: Generated synthetic signals with 20 active MUs. For clarity reasons, only a portion of generated SEMG signals is depicted.

Reference values are depicted with blue solid lines.     Real SEMG signals:     61 electrodes (5 columns and 13 lines, columns aligned with muscle fibres) from the dominant biceps brachii muscle of 9 healthy male subjects (age 26.8 \u00b1 2.2 years, height 179 \u00b1 7 cm and weight of 72.1 \u00b1 8.3 kg). The aforementioned electrode array was developed by the LISiN laboratory at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. Isometric mucle contractions were performed at 5% and 10% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force, respectively. Single differential recordings were amplified, band-pass filtered (3 dB bandwidth, 10 Hz-500 Hz) and sampled at 2500 Hz. The acquired signals are exemplified in Fig. 14. The results obtained by the CKC method are exemplified in Figs. from 15 to 19. Figs 20 and 21 depict the results of other two decomposition techniques in comparison with the results of CKC method.

Innovation of the Interreg MED Programme. The activities will support the sub-objective 1.1 and especially the Green Growth sub-priority, in order to serve the targets and strategies of the Managing Authorities for the MED Area. The project has been designed as an agile tool that will unify project results, support MED stakeholders and create a fruitful and collaborative environment for all implicated bodies.     The project has been designed as an agile tool that will unify modular project results, support MED stakeholders and create a fruitful and collaborative environment for all implicated bodies. The project will act as a bridge between the modular projects, the Governance project - \"platform\"- of Axis 4 and the EU policy makers. A network of key groups including SMEs, academics, research institutes and governing authorities (Quadruple helix representatives) will be established. SYNGGI has been structured to support communication, capitalization activities and at the same time it aims beyond MED territories. The project will produce unified results and solid proposals for environmental policies. General objectives of SYNGGI project are:     Stimulating sharing of project results and findings     Enhancing the cross-sectorial innovation practices among MED key stakeholders     Disseminating good practices     Creating synergies at local, national and EU level     Avoiding duplication of results     Creating hubs for all external stakeholders of the MED Area     Reinforcement of \u201cPlatform Project\u201d (Axis 4) so as to reach EU officials and produce innovative policies     Tecos' role:     Associated partner responsible for creation of an important synergies between actors of SYNGGI and stakeholders at national, EU and global level. Organisation of Mid-term meeting in Slovenia in combination with the transnational event: provisional date \u2013 April, 2018.     Sample Project     The client had to renew a wore down rotor with knife segments for which they didn't have any documentation. With precise 3D scanning of the original and creation of functional CAD model we provided them with data for production of replacement.     The customer has presumed problems with excessive warpage in the stage of tool design. The material is PA66 with 30% of glass fibers. With the help of advanced injection moulding analysis we predicted the trend and values of warpage and thus successfully eliminated the problems.     Our client has planned a single phase deep drawing process for the presented case, however several doubts about manufacturability arose. The conducted analysis has cleared all doubts.     We made a comparative study between experimentaly and numerically determined strength of a fibre reinforced product, which yielded extremely good match of the results from both methods. "

The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Extension of the macroprudential recommendation to consumer loans     11\/05\/2018 \/ Press release     With the aim of preventing the relaxation of credit standards and improving banks\u2019 resilience, the Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia has decided to expand the existing macroprudential recommendation for housing loans to consumer loans. The decision was prompted by the high growth in mostly non-purpose-specific consumer loans of longer maturities, which in the event of a reversal in the economic cycle could give rise to difficulties in the repayment of these loans. The macroprudential measure is prudential in nature, and protects banks and consumers.     The Bank of Slovenia\u2019s assessment is that the risks in the consumer loan market are currently moderate and manageable, which is partly attributable to the favourable economic climate. However, there has been high growth in consumer loans for some time now. The factors on the supply side (low interest rates, banks\u2019 high capital adequacy, etc.) and on the demand side (low household indebtedness, good economic climate, high employment, etc.) are still favourable, for which reason relatively high growth in consumer lending is also expected in the future. At the same time it has been found that the maturities of these loans are increasing, and often exceed the expected lifetime of consumer goods. Their long loan maturities mean that these loans will remain on bank balance sheets even when the reversal comes in the economic cycle, owing to which difficulties in their repayment loans could arise very quickly in the event of the materialisation of macroeconomic risks. In the majority of cases consumer loans are not purpose-specific, which increases the risk of the improper use of funds.     With the aim of preventing the relaxation of credit standards and improving banks\u2019 resilience, at its 610th meeting of 22 October 2018 the Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia decided to expand the existing macroprudential recommendation for housing loans to consumer loans.The Bank of Slovenia recommends that the ratio of the annual servicing of the total debt to the annual net income of the individual (i.e. the DSTI) when a loan agreement is concluded should not exceed 50% for persons with a monthly income of up to EUR 1,700 (or for the portion of income up to this amount), and 67% for the portion of income above EUR 1,700. It is further recommended that in the loan approval process (when assessing creditworthiness) banks should apply, mutatis mutandis, the limitations on the attachment of a debtor\u2019s financial assets set out in the Enforcement and Securing of Claims Act (ZIZ) and the Tax Procedure Act (ZDavP-2). It is also recommended that the maturity of new consumer loans should not exceed 120 months.     Banks are hereby reminded that they must still assess the creditworthiness of the borrower themselves, and are responsible for the take-up of the risks inherent in newly approved loans.     The Bank of Slovenia will continue to diligently monitor the dynamics in household lending, and in the event of increased risks to financial stability will introduce binding macroprudential instruments as necessary.     The full text of the recommendation can be found on this link, where precise definitions of the terms are also given. "
