With this data processing document, we would like to inform you about     the scope of data processing, how long the data is stored, and to whom your data will be accessible;     what your rights and remedies are in regard to data processing.     Please read the notice carefully. In case you may have any questions, we would like you to ask you to consult with us before accepting the notice on info@develor.com.     We would like to inform you in advance that you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data in case the data was obtained for the enforcement of our legitimate interest or for the purpose of marketing as described below.     BASIC INFORMATION     Who will process your personal data?     Your data will be process by Develor International Private Limited Company (DEVELOR International \u201cZ\u00e1rtk\u00f6r\u0171en M\u0171k\u00f6d\u0151\u201d R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g), as data controller.

Fundamental concepts of data protection     Further below, we will present the most important concepts we use during our data processing with the help of icons:     The purpose of data processing:     Every single personal data is processed for a specific purpose, and these purposes are not linked together (e.g. we will only send you newsletters, if you have separately given your consent to that). In case we wish to process your data provided to us at an earlier time, we will inform you about it in advance.     Legal bases for data processing:     Data processing can have different legal basis depending on the purpose of processing: it can happen during fulfilling legal obligations (e.g. invoicing), or in implementation of a contract concluded with you, or in case of pursuit of any legitimate interests (e.g. dispute settlement), or with your consent. How do they differ?     In case of \u201clegal obligations\u201d, data processing is compulsory for us irrespectively of your consent or objection.     In case of \u201cconcluding a contract \/ implementing a contract\u201d, it is not obligatory to provide the requested data, however, in the absence of it, the contract will not be concluded, and you cannot receive the desired services.     Regarding \u201clegitimate interests\u201d, when there is an existing business relationship, we can contact you with the purpose of establishing a future business relationship, and we can process your data for pursuing our legitimate interests in case of an existing relationship (e.g. outstanding invoices, enforcing legal claims, providing evidence regarding administrative\/legal proceedings). Moreover, security camera surveillance at training sites also has the same legal basis.     Regarding \u201cconsent\u201d, we do not need it separately for the above-mentioned cases, however, certain amenity services (e.g. signing up for newsletter) can only be supplied if, with full knowledge of this Notice, you consent to the processing of the required personal data in advance. If, however, you do not consent to it, you shall not suffer any detriment because of it.     Concept of personal data:     Every information that is relating to you as a natural person and based on which you can be directly or indirectly identified, is called personal data (e.g. data related to customer identification, invoicing, contact details, e-mail address or IP address as well).     In cooperation with our customers, we always process the following data related to a given service, which is provided in a contract, or through an (online) form, or requested through consultation:     representative, contact person of the company, or in case of an individual entrepreneur: name, e-mail address, phone number, fax number, other provided contact details, workplace\/job, signature, other information related to communication;     in case of an individual entrepreneur such data further includes: billing name and address, VAT number;     in case of a private person: name, billing name and address, e-mail, and other provided contact details, signature.     Duration of data processing:     Processing of personal data shall only be performed for as little time as is strictly essential for supplying the given service it is associated with. If this period is over, your digitally stored data will be permanently deleted, and the data stored in paper form will be destroyed.     We are obliged to keep records and documents needed for fulfilling our tax and accounting dependency for the period required by the legislation in force (in accordance with Section 169 subsection 2 of Sz\u00e1mviteli tv., the accounting documents shall be stored for 8 years, while the tax and VAT payment documents shall be stored until the expiration of the right to tax assessment limitation period).     In case of every data processing purpose mentioned below (based on legitimate interest and when circumstances indicate it), we are authorised to process personal data until the enforceability of our legal right ends (general rule of limitation applies after 5 years).     Data transfer:     In certain cases, your personal data may be transferred to so called data processors (in some cases to other data controllers). Usually such transfer is necessary for providing the rendered services, and for service development within the Develor Group (e.g. measuring client satisfaction).     Personal data is usually stored in digital form as well, which, if necessary, can be accessed by the data processors operating our case management and information technology systems:     Isolutions Informatikai Kft.

Another argument in favour of camera usage is being able to help the investigation authorities and individuals who might have suffered an injury of damage.

In certain cases, despite withdrawing your consent, we can continue to lawfully manage your personal data \u2013 in such cases we will provide you with detailed information.     It is important to note that withdrawing your consent does not affect our legitimacy to process data prior to the withdrawal.

Correction     You can contact us anytime in case you notice a mistake in your data processed by us, or you can request us to complete or correct it and transfer your new data to our registry (e.g. in case of change in e-mail address).

      "text":" Tomo Stani\u010d: On some differences     \u201cIdeas are non-material forms, yet forms are also ideas that have found their material form.\u201d1     I shall establish a defining difference between VSSD and AO \u2013 the diction to \u201cstart from a certain difference\u201d would suggest a far greater discontinuity of artistic practice than the verb \u201cto establish\u201d, which shifts the weight onto the theoretical category. VSSD features scenographic installations, spatial images, total ambiences-installations, Gesamtkunstwerk \u2013 comprehensive artworks that attack the spectator with a broad array of tools from an artistic store room. This is not simply about provoking the eyes and refreshing their sharpness, because one enters these images-ambiences with the entire body; one enters the scent, the time, the sound \u2026 At this point, the difference between the installation-work on the one hand and the document-photography on the other is clearly revealed. Unlike AO\u2019s practice, which I have for the most part had the opportunity to see in person, VSSD only offers photographs of works from catalogues. Some works communicate, expand, polemicize, even come to life through these documents, while others demand presence and an experience, which is why I\u2019ve written \u201cestablish\u201d and not \u201cstart from\u201d.     The reason I insist on the notion of difference lies foremost in the fact that AO\u2019s practice does not present itself as flashy, noisy and luxurious, but is often compressed from a spatial ambience into an object \u2013 elements are not added, but removed and abstracted. Some exhibitions undoubtedly distance themselves from colors and only present white forms-objects, as if picturesqueness stepped back and let form take the stand, even though in a way liveliness and diversity have been preserved through AO\u2019s objects as well. In any case, we are dealing with a shift from a person that comprehensively participates in spatial installations to a spectator who touches the object, establishes an intimate contact with it and observes it, so to speak, on his own, unlike previous spaces that swallowed spectators up. Perhaps we\u2019re dealing with a gesture of delimitation, of drawing a dividing line between VSSD and AO with a new independent artistic practice. It is not my intention to offer this difference as evidence of complete discontinuity or relinquishment, even elimination or repression of a certain practice, even though it often seems that it is not an other author who is behind the most recent practice, but a different one. Some elements resonate in AO\u2019s posterior practice \u2013 as the famous adage goes: \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d In this sense, a common reading is quite interesting \u2013 as a rhyme, reply and objection of one work to the other.     The first difference relates to the spectator and I shall, for the time being, leave that aside and only use it as a springboard \u2026 After all, plenty of ink has already been spilled on the matter. At this point I wish to think one thing and one thing only: objects. I intentionally won\u2019t call them sculptures, installations, plastics or anything similar, not because I would object to it \u2013 they are undoubtedly part of this family \u2013 but because the focal thought of the discussion must take place before all the \u201cart classification rubbish,\u201d if I may use a somewhat provocative term. I am interested in objects before we enter the world of art, before the questions on installation, on the relation between plastic and space, on the distance of observation or touch, and before we label them with the signifier sculpture, installation, piece \u2026 In short, prior to asking the questions that fall within the context of art, I am interested to know why someone creates certain objects, I am interested in the dialogue with objects. AO\u2019s practice is perfect for such an undertaking, and I believe that it is also particularly challenging for thought. It is for this reason that I shall attempt to tackle it at the most abstract level.     One final comment needs to be made before we begin: many of O\u017ebolt\u2019s objects are accompanied by texts. These are not interpretations, but parallels that put artistic objects in a certain context, even though they never reply to it. I wonder whether it makes sense to go through these works in search of a hermeneutic explanation that would uncover the artist\u2019s hidden narrative. In such a case, words would quickly hit a blank wall (sometimes quite literally) or a blank object, even if this has never deterred thought from examining the issue. In no way do I advocate silence or wordless admiration. I believe this is where a new thought is emerging, and if nothing else, at least the desire to enunciate \u2026 Then again, that\u2019s enough, if not too much already.     OBJECTS     Cast: Various things or objects. Author: Martin Heidegger. Subject: To outline the difference between embeddedness and the presence of things in the world. Hypothesis: The primary and most common contact with things (in our case, objects) is not \u201cmere perceptual cognition\u201d,2 but the possibility of handling and using them \u2013 not to observe them but in order to deal with them. In this way a different \u201cknowledge\u201d of the object is constituted, such as could be introduced by an analytic view.3 Heidegger adds: \u201cThis being is not the object of a theoretical \u2018world\u2019-cognition; it is what is used, produced, and so on.\u201d4 It follows that we come to know things foremost by using them, which is why various descriptions of their qualities (such as materiality, dimensions, color) will not get us very far; instead, we must come to know the way in which they are embedded in the world.     This critique aims at the presence of things (Vorhandenheit), which purports to ignore the very essence of things. Things are not \u201cobjectively given\u201d to us \u2013 that is, entirely measurable through their physical qualities \u2013 but are objects that open up and intertwine into a network of relations, purposes, uses, contacts etc. To view an object solely from the standpoint of its qualities would mean that we strip it of all life (use, unexpectedness, relations) \u2013 that is, we distance it from experience, events and changes \u2013 of what is abstracted, ripped away from the context of space and time and tailored or, better yet, subjugated to measurements. This is why Heidegger uses the term useful things or tools (die Zeuge), to further accentuate their use, and then continues: \u201cStrictly speaking, there \u2018is\u2019 no such thing as a useful thing. There always belongs to the being of a useful thing a totality of useful things in which this useful thing can be what it is. A useful thing is essentially \u2018something in order to \u2026\u2019\u201d5 And this \u201cin order to\u201d is a linking element that opens up a reference to other things: a useful thing for writing, viewing, driving etc. Useful things refer to other objects, they establish a relation to them \u2013 to be useful means to be in relation to something, to be for something. A useful object does not close in on itself, but opens up to something \u2013 we never see useful tools on their own, in the same way we never understand them individually first (as a table, light, pen) and only subsequently piece together the living space; on the contrary, they fundamentally reveal themselves as useful things for living, and we only subsequently see a room, table, pen etc. In short, the totality of useful things reveals itself before the individual useful thing.     The next step: not only that a useful thing most authentically expresses itself through relation and use (a hammer through hammering), but a reverse effect is also established, where use itself consciously adapts the tool \u2013 a useful thing originates from handling, a tool adapts itself to work. Hammering with a hammer reveals the handiness of a hammer, which is, in turn, supposedly its very own specific way of being, through which a hammer reveals itself and adapts to it. It is precisely because a tool\u2019s handiness is inscribed in its very essence that we cannot consider it a contingent appendage that is pinned to the tool. A useful thing is at our disposal for a certain use, and its handiness is therefore not conceived as a consequence of interpretation or complementary ability, but of the useful thing\u2019s core, its virtual side so to speak, which is necessarily its component. Useful things are never \u201cmerely present\u201d, whereby we would only subsequently attribute select aspects of use to them.6 What is more, this \u201cin order to\u201d, that is, their purpose or use, is not the only thing that we encounter in useful things, for the manufacturer and user inscribe themselves in them as well. Consequently, useful things mirror the context from which they come and their own relations to the world.     Now we can better understand the struggle against the so-called \u201cobjectivity\u201d and the criticism of the \u201ctheoretical observation\u201d of useful things \u2013 even though we must not sing praises to practice and push theories aside too hastily; practicality is not thought atheoretically. At this point we must not give in to temptation and sever contemplation\u2011thinking from action, for a thought is already part of an action. Just as a practice has its own perception, thought and action, so does a theory. The intention behind Heidegger\u2019s delimitation is hidden foremost in highlighting something special, even seemingly contradictory \u2013 that is, the very fact that a useful thing in its handiness withdraws from being truly present. Withdrawal means that a thing is not present as appearance or a quality, but a useful thing\u2011tool in a way dissipates and merges with work.7 Harman\u2019s example of a bridge speaks volumes: the reality of a bridge is not the amalgamation of asphalt and the steel construction, but the bridging of a gap: \u201cThe bridge is a bridge-effect.\u201d8 A useful thing necessarily resides from itself for something else, it is inevitably in relation to something, even if its use is never actualized. An object\u2011useful thing withdraws from presence in order to become a tool for something \u2013 a task or work come first, and one reaches for a tool only as a consequence of this task. It is worth recalling the famous example of a jug: a jug is made only to provide support to emptiness. A jug is empty for being filled with water. And this leads us to Heidegger\u2019s central division into Zuhanden and Vorhanden, translated as handiness and presence.9     Zuhandenheit is a useful thing-tool\u2019s way of being that makes itself evident foremost through embeddedness and use: \u201cThe act of hammering itself discovers the specific \u2018handiness\u2019 of the hammer.\u201d10 A useful thing is realized, or rather, it comes to itself through being used. What is most important, however, is that a useful thing functions smoothly only when it is practically invisible. What we primarily perceive is a network of automatized functioning, where, if it truly functions, useful things are invisible \u2013 they withdraw from presence to merge without disturbance with the flow of activity. Heidegger\u2019s hypothesis postulates that excessive commitment to \u201cobjective presence\u201d would miss the object\u2019s core \u2013 an explanation of a useful thing\u2019s specific way of being cannot follow from it.     In order to avoid any confusion, I repeat: the world is not given to us as mere presence, we always enter it by way of handiness (Zuhandenheit) \u2013 things appear within our (biased) perception and use. To reach the so-called \u201cobjective\u201d presence we must pass through handiness. Things are therefore \u201cobjectively\u201d given first and it is only with use that they are deformed and reshaped into anthropomorphic tools. Mere presence (Vorhandenheit) means that the process of abstraction has already taken place \u2013 useful things have already been ripped away from the embeddedness of self-evident relations. Vorhandenheit is therefore a thing of factual presence, of categories, measurability and immutable presence. To oversimplify, the difference between zu\u2013 and vor\u2013 is parallel to the difference between relation and substance, or between a useful thing embedded into the network of human use and its supposed independence from man. To lose handiness, however, does not mean to lose legibility; the change is not symbolic, but real. Even though abandoned or useless objects sever some relations they always carry within them the memory of the previous function, they come from a known context, they carry their history with them etc.11 Handiness is never completely lost, it can be brought back to life.     In our case, the composition of the two opposing sides is not as significant as the passage from one to another (from Zuhanden to Vorhanden), which is actually not an outline of a smooth passage but the appearance of some kind of stuttering, faltering or stuckness. Stuttering retroactively reveals the true meaning and operation of handiness: an inappropriate and malfunctioning tool or unsuitability of a material for a certain use only becomes evident because the flow of use is disrupted. Stuttering makes things visible. Only when objects-useful things are taken out of the flow of mutual reference and operation do they acquire a visible presence. A malfunctioned tool therefore does not only change physically (if at all); what changes is the way in which it is embedded, its relations and how it is handled. In other words, the visibility and presence of useful tools implies that something went wrong. Stuttering gives visibility to things, objects catch our eye, they come to a standstill, become noticeable \u2013 the hammer falls from the hand and catches the eye. Heidegger even claims that such objects become disturbing and obtrusive. In such cases, some kind of a fall from the established occurs \u2013 something did not go smoothly or was inappropriate or useless, it lost the\/its right place. He goes on to say that the disturbing, useless and unhandy must be removed or pushed back into action, into handiness \u2013 stifling presence must be eliminated, it must withdraw from visibility once again and merge with a place inside the whole.     We, however, are interested in the exact opposite path, not in the withdrawal within automatic and self\u2011evident work, but in stuttering \u2013 things that are in the way, the excessive things that acquire a visible presence. There\u2019s nothing to be seen in automatized operation. Present objects are useless, but they further burden the spectator with their perceptual characteristics \u2013 they are more present as material objects than they are dispersed in work. These are objects for\u2011nothing, and only as such do they fall from self\u2011evidence and open up to the possibility of a different being and experience. Isn\u2019t presence (Vorhandenheit) therefore much deeper than what is first put to \u201cdirect\u201d use? What Heidegger calls impoverishment of the object, that which supposedly objectifies it the most, is, surprisingly, what enriches it.     \u2026 digression     Heidegger uses the analysis of useful things as the basis for his critique of presence, in which he sees no possibility for a different understanding or interpretation, and points out the fundamental role that handiness plays in man\u2019s being\u2011in\u2011the\u2011world. Graham Harman follows the same reading, only he places the moment of withdrawal outside the human viewpoint. His initial thought in relation to which he wishes to establish delimitation is condensed in the following quote: \u201cWhen I stare at a river, wolf, government, machine, or army, I do not grasp the whole of their reality. This reality slips from view into a perpetually veiled underworld, leaving me with only the most frivolous simulacra of these entities. In short, the phenomenal reality of things for consciousness does not use up their being.\u201d12 More, apparently, is hidden in things than we perceive. Another example: \u201cNo sensual profile of these things will ever exhaust its full reality, which withdraws into the dusk of a shadowy underworld. But if something hides behind the many profiles of apples, what hides from view is not our use of the apple, but rather the apple itself. After all, using a thing distorts its reality no less than making theories about it does.\u201d13 In Harman\u2019s theoretical opus, withdrawal, which was strictly tied to human attachment\u2011relation to the world (as experience, acting and use) in contrast to tedious objectivity (quality, measurability, appearance), acquired serious ontological consequences \u2013 withdrawal or withholding designate inaccessible things that supposedly reside in the \u201chidden underworld\u201d. In short, something truthful \u201cin itself\u201d lies in the darkness, and we do not have direct access to it.14 And the deduction that follows is quite interesting: \u201cThe thing-in-itself escapes us not because we are humans who think, but because we are entities that relate, just like fire relating to cotton or raindrops to a tin roof.\u201d15 It is not simply about the inability to understand, but also about the problem of the one-sidedness of joint effect and practice, both of which fail to grasp a large part of the object itself \u2013 rain touches the roof in a specific way, and its touch is different from that of a fire or a human touch.16 Things do not elude us because we are always biased and limited to anthropomorphism, but because we are necessarily in a relation with them; what reveals itself also conceals itself, observation from one point of view means we miss a different one. Harman takes us one step further: \u201cBut what if we had kept the things-in-themselves and eliminated instead the privilege of the human-world relation over all others?\u201d17 OOO\u2019s epistemological stake is that objects and relations between them are thinkable precisely because they are real, out there, so to speak, even though (and here\u2019s the retroactive punch once again) they are withdrawn and unknowable. This hypothesis is extremely seductive, but somewhat risky, as that which was supressed returns to the surface with each subsequent step: From what position can we make such a statement? How can it be possible to know something external to our register? Harman replies that the unthinkable can only be thought insofar as we think it indirectly by means of an innuendo, allusion or metaphor. He believes that philosophy as well should not use clear language, but \u201cvivid language\u201d. It is contradictory, as Cole points out, that such a philosophical position wants \u201cto decenter the human, but as a language \u2013 and perforce as a way of thinking \u2013 it expands the human into all relations.\u201d18 But what else can we do if we know that any neutrally constructed language will also sooner or later lead to contradictions and coincidences? The latter might actually be the answer: to not move away from language nor limit it, but to go through it in a sense \u2013 that is, by using contradictions, polysemy and coincidences, by crossing the boundaries or conundrums of a language.19 We\u2019ll leave that question open for now\u2026     Allow me to provide another, somewhat more figurative example: \u201cOur use of the floor as \u2018equipment for standing\u2019 makes no contact with the abundance of extra qualities that dogs or mosquitoes might be able to detect.\u201d20 Second thoughts: Where, in fact, is this abundance of qualities located? Would the argumentation change in any way if we substituted the floor with a window and insects that most likely don\u2019t even sense it? To think a window already means to be subordinated to abstraction and separation of a part from the whole, it means to think a unit and unity. Is a window (un)perceived by a fly still a window \u2013 where does it, in fact, begin and end? Is there one window \u2026 does it even have a frame? \u2026 And if the fly\u2019s window is completely different, what is the supposed window \u201cin itself\u201d like? Window glass of course has some real effects \u2013 even if a fly does not see the glass, it will undoubtedly fly right into it (as we often see) \u2013 but what I\u2019m trying to hint at is not that relations or joint effects do not exist, but rather that all these statements tell much more about how we see\/perceive things than they do about how things are \u201cin themselves\u201d. We cannot simply \u201crise above ourselves\u201d as neutral and uninvolved spectators, and henceforth think all flies, floors and, indeed, relations as if they remain completely identical. In this case, consistency would also question the very notion of unity (of the window), consistency of perception, notion of the object etc. I only attempt to address the fact that if we step behind the curtain of humanity, there\u2019s a danger that we\u2019ll be left empty-handed.     Thinking an object is not to be too hastily equated with an idealistic position that cannot really touch an object \u201cout there\u201d, which is also Hartman\u2019s indirect reproach: \u201cToday\u2019s philosophical populace still favors the claim that we cannot think something without thinking it, thereby returning us to an inescapable closed circle of thought.\u201d21 Concealed in this statement are a pre\u2011critical division that posits things as complete out there and a thought that is supposed to simply describe this fully finished out there. There might be no way out of this circle of thought, it might even be closed in a sense, but that does not mean that it is limited, much less transparent to itself \u2013 we do not observe the edges of thought from an all-seeing viewpoint, we stumble upon them. From this standpoint, thought is not\u2011all, it is ridden with antagonisms and ruptures within itself. Without advocating obscurantism, thought can proceed altogether rationally, yet sooner or later it will fold into itself and show its heterogeneity \u2013 thought itself restructures the thinkable. Neither are we dealing with pure coincidences or ramblings, but with necessity, only that this necessity is established retroactively. The problem is therefore reversed, not in the sense that \u201cthere are things that are completely unthinkable\u201d, but that \u201cthe unthinkable itself is thinkable\u201d. After all, thought also cultivates a certain degree of autonomy, a kind of autonomy; this is, in fact, some kind of participation in thought, where we do not know exactly where it will show its limit, fall into paradox or fold into itself \u2013 it is, so to speak, some \u201cit is thought\u201d in which we are not quite versed, nor do we choose it ourselves.     Scientific discourse could also be discussed in parallel with the above and as a reply to Harman\u2019s scepsis: the difference between nature and science that Lacan builds on is not the difference between nature as a completely impermeable and non\u2011transparent thing in itself on the one hand, and an independent scientific discourse as an inventory of nature adapted to humans on the other; to the contrary, science opens a new space of \u201cnature\u201d, where this discourse has real consequences. What is important is that this is not an inventory of nature, but new content that allows us to \u201ctouch\u201d nature, which consequently also means that science not only adds something to reality as such, but even changes it. In this respect, Lacan points out that \u201cscientific discourse was able to bring about the moon landing, where thought becomes witness to a performance of the real\u201d.22     This is precisely why Harman\u2019s realism, which simultaneously constructs a whole universe of things in themselves external to our register and later brings them under a distinctly human conceptual apparatus of interpersonal relations and effects, is not a completely consistent way out of an idealistic position. We need to bear in mind that the very foundation of division (deceiving perception\/real exterior) represents a transcendental precondition that is primarily a product of our comprehension.23 So, how do we move on? By including the ineffectiveness and failures of our own position. In other words, the escape from the predicament of \u201cHow to touch things with words?\u201d is possible precisely through thought-motion itself, both of an object and a notion, for every approach to the supposed being-in-itself will sooner or later reshape it. Slogan: Through the deadlock of an interpretation that is always already an intervention. The position I wish to take is not exactly realism, but an attempt to move the very incommensurability of a pair (of object and notion) through the point where we inscribe ourselves into it. Even if it seems that we observe the world from the outside \u2013 as a permanently foreign spectator \u2013 we do not have a clear, self\u2011transparent view of the enclosed whole of the world, but a view of the inside from within, as a compound in a compound that folds, exceeds and dissolves itself. This means that we ourselves are immersed in the guts of the world and that we have the power to set off its pulse.     Now we can also answer the question of language: it is not about the problem of an innuendo or an allusion to something beyond our thought, but about proceeding through thought to arrive at something that was not thinkable before and that has real consequences. That is why the OOO theory is not reproached for being over\u2011objective, in the sense that the subjective aspect is completely omitted; on the contrary, the problem is that the foundation is set all too subjectively and does not take into consideration inability as the actual division of thought. It\u2019s not that theory does not go far enough; in a sense, it goes too far describing and making presumptions about our knowledge. Why? Because it does not consider the fact that internal inconsistency and contradiction of our knowledge not only means that we are unable to get to what being-in-itself should supposedly be, but it shakes the whole foundation much sooner \u2013 the very constitution of our reality creates what in-itself supposedly is. We must not forget that the very essence of things appears precisely through the disposal of a false appearance \u2013 the essence resides only in the deceptiveness of the appearance of things. What appears in perception itself is the stratification of a phenomenon, which creates some kind of an in front and behind the phenomenon, the possibility of displacement and deception \u2013 nothing is actually concealed, all concealment comes from perception.24 The difficulty is not to project various ideas into the empty beyond, but to understand the emergence of this beyond in the first place. For this reason, movement of thought is possible precisely through self-differentiation of what is perceived, through its layers and even through its self-elimination. It\u2019s therefore not about the substantialisation of this beyond, but about the disparity of the \u201cwithin\u201d.25 In Hegel\u2019s terminology: substance needs to be thought as a subject.     Translation into Heideggerian language: the richness and inexhaustible attributes of handiness (Zuhandenheit) are foremost a retroactive effect of presence (Vorhandenheit). Which would, within the OOO interpretation, read as follows: it\u2019s not about the limitless possibilities of a real object versus final and partial perception, but that infinity of the object is born from stutterings-deadlocks, from becoming present (particularly the ascent of notion as an effect of language). Immense sensual richness of the perceptible is nothing more than the retroactive effect of a word.26 Interestingly, this richness appears as always already lost or absent \u2013 as possibilities that haven\u2019t been exhausted \u2013 which only further confirms that these are merely \u201cword possibilities\u201d. It follows that mere being\u2011in\u2011itself is the effect of a cut and not something that would be limited by both practice and theory; on the contrary, every contact enlivens (opens) and changes the object. A different path is now opening up before us, one that does not think objects as independent of humans, but rather objectness as a product of humans \u2013 and consequently also the reason we incessantly get stuck with (art) objects.     ART OBJECTS     How to think an art object in relation to Heidegger\u2019s handiness and presence? These two are not parallel to recognizability and unrecognizability: recognition implies a thing-object in a certain context, its placement, legibility and purpose; to be unrecognized on the other hand designates objects that we don\u2019t know what to do with, objects that are not in-place or understandable. It seems that art objects move between these two positions, perhaps they even must be recognized in order to truly become unrecognizability or to cause it. This pair is of no help: in a way, art objects are passages from a recognizable structure into an unrecognizable one. They stem from a specific context and often have a certain purpose, and at the same time they are also an attempt to reach for something or open something unrecognizable. Some works take advantage of quick recognizability and self-evidence to strike back and even turn the situation from which they stem upside down.     Let\u2019s give it another try with a different pair: handiness of artworks is often pre-determined and leaves little to coincidence \u2013 the work is created for a certain (gallery) space or the art market and for a chosen public, how the work is to be handled is carefully outlined and often expected, sometimes even the work\u2019s status is ordained. We could claim that a work often enters an automatized mechanism of a cultural context, but that doesn\u2019t get us anywhere. We\u2019re still moving around within handiness and evident use, we\u2019re at the level of the statement that a hammer is made for hammering. The very moment something goes awry and does not run smoothly we enter the terrain of presence, where things are anything but evident and where even a hammer would exit from its self\u2011evidence.     Let us return to the example of a jug, even if it is somewhat misleading. The jug\u2019s emptiness is not all that different from the possibility of hammering with a hammer. The jug opens up a space that is strictly purposeful, much as a hammer opens the possibility to hammer nails and a typewriter the possibility to type. This emptiness, however, is not to be understood as openness, but as relationality, which is a crucial difference. There are objects which cause a different kind of emptiness: 1. Empty space \u2013 openness as the possibility of an interpretation outside the strictly limited useful specter. 2. Out-of-placement \u2013 objects drill a hole in a given context and function as a closure, blockade or unintelligibility. There is a difference between a missing object and a missing place, but we\u2019re nevertheless dealing with disparity and stuttering in both cases. It needs to be stressed that an artwork is not an empty jug that one would fill, but an empty jug full of non-use \u2013 it opens up space that cannot be filled. Something must go wrong, be useless or redundant and bothersome in order to draw attention to itself, and an art object is often a synonym for disparity with itself, a useless object with no right place. It may be true that the majority of objects we deal with are anthropomorphized \u2013 from, for and suited to humans \u2013 they are at hand, or at foot, or whatever, but here we\u2019re not standing before different objects trying to discern the traces of our comprehension and how dependent they are on our view; it is precisely presence (Vorhandenheit) that shows that disruption exists, as does the stuttering of objects, which are created (from and for culture) but always cause some kind of interruption, de-anthropomorphization of the object \u2026 something that causes them to be out-of-place, useless and unhandy. Presence testifies to a disruption, as if it were some kind of a counter-attack on handiness, it is an object and understanding in the making, but first and foremost it is the emergence of misunderstanding. Is it really a coincidence that paintings often had a frame, sculptures a base, galleries a clearly defined set of rules etc.? Are these not means that push handiness away only to outline as much as possible the presence of work and break the ties with the surroundings? Handiness is intentionally pushed away in order to put us before the wall of artistic presence.     Can an artwork even be called a useful thing any longer? Useful for what, exactly? In the case of the jug, the material from which it is made is not even as important as is the fact that it holds and transports water. Which brings us back to the question of a bridge made from matches: Does it really bridge anything? What is its handiness? Is its use or operation not intended (or even withdrawn, withheld) to become and display presence? However, there is some doubt whether this presence is authentic. Is it not merely handiness in disguise that immediately dissipates in the comfort-use of the eye? Nevertheless, it is also true that an artwork hides not only in work as such but is harnessed in an activity. An artwork can be a \u201ctool\u201d for something \u2013 for example to move something, maybe thought \u2013 but only indirectly, through the point of stuttering, of impassability. But \u2013 and this is essential \u2013 an artwork only operates through inoperability. A work does not bridge gaps but breaks connections. The less it is dissipated in use, the more it shows itself and becomes present \u2026 And if it really is a tool, it\u2019s a tool for non\u2011operation.     Stuttering is therefore a point of an unusual passage \u2013 it is a metamorphosis or a transformation. And it is unusual because it designates impassability \u2013 that which gets stuck can no longer move forward, while that which passes is re-created. Something can continue on through its own being-other, through its own dispersal, because it wasn\u2019t able to cross the point of passage. If a concept can truly be comprehended only through some kind of motion (towards itself), then what follows through the work of words or material realization \u2013 through the work being put into the world, being actualized \u2013 is that the (art) object is a condemnation of this same concept. Let me explain: a concept is sharpened through motion \u2013 the sharper it gets the less things stick to it, until the last phase where we finally lose the blade itself and the only thing we are left with is the shape of a cut. In a sense we\u2019re dealing with what appears to be a contradiction: to get to itself, it must abandon itself. That is why it is also not necessary for an examination of a thought to stay in the pre-determined idea. To pass into being-other could therefore be read literally: to pass into some other being, to be re-shaped or dispersed, to be translated into a different thing. A concept or notion has no trouble with inflections through various shapes of thought, or, in fact, through various beings. When an understanding or a conception comes to a halt it simply uses a translation, it can slip into an object, a painterly gesture or musical notation. Why? So that thought can get going, that an object can take it over and push it forward, make a reply and cause undulation and mobilization of thought. A thought is thought in different registers. An art object is a revitalization of thought \u2013 it is something that pushes its own idea forward and is simultaneously a witness to and a place of thought\u2019s stuttering, its (im)passability.     Any object could likely be explained from a human point of view, from the viewpoint of handiness, and it is true that even an art object is created with a certain purpose, with a presupposed problem\u2011idea, from a known material, with a certain context etc. Even though such an object is never fully reducible to the thinkable it is some kind of an object-answer, a break over unthinkableness, where it must transform itself into something else. This means that it replies precisely from a place that understanding or conception cannot reach. A work can come from what is already known and can also re\u2011merge and dissipate into the known, but it always crosses the point of deadlock, it marks the point of presence. This is why it might be somewhat rash to condemn it as a problem of \u201cbeing doomed to the closed circle of thought\u201d or to an \u201canthropocentric view\u201d. We could say that each creation operates as a mirror to humans, with the exception of the very act of installing a mirror. That is why I\u2019m interested in the opposite pole, not the individual object, independent of humans\/perception. I do not attempt to think nor understand this \u201coutside-the-human\u201d, but on the contrary, to think or understand the practice that is strictly related to humans and is at times even very personal, which makes it non-transparent. The struggle for the art object is therefore not about the object communicating a message, but foremost about actualization of thought, about the part beyond the reach of an idea. It is therefore necessary to refute the outpouring of the great author that knows everything and would pour his heart out if only he had a piece of paper \u2026 That is why we must not forget another expression in which Heidegger himself did not see any true potential, which is presence. If handiness denotes motion \u2013 passing inside a network of effect \u2013 then presence is motionless; it denotes the break as a reshaping, a necessary passing into being-other. Presence is the making-present of motion\u2019s stuttering. We don\u2019t need to look for being-in-itself out there when we see that the main deadlock is already \u201cin here\u201d \u2013 in thought and work that are most fully our own. This is why \u017di\u017eek writes: \u201cIt is not enough to insist on the non-transparency of objects, on how objects have a hidden core withdrawn from human reach: what is withdrawn is not just the hidden side of objects but above all the true dimension of the subject\u2019s activity.\u201d27 A change of optics is needed: it is not about the richness of the object in itself that necessarily slips away from the subject of perception, but the excess of the subject itself that is non\u2011transparent to itself and cannot see its own point of inscription in the object. That is why I insist that there is a certain \u201cit is thought\u201d that necessarily inflects, breaks and reshapes itself. An artwork is a presence, it is the torture of object\u2011material in order to give thought a new shape. The conclusion and reply to Harman\u2019s dilemma mentioned above: not only are we always doomed to the closed circle of our thought, we\u2019re not even its masters. And the latter is also the only possible point where works of art can emerge.     REDUNDANT OBJECTS     Another difference between VSSD and AO is hidden in an expression used by the author himself \u2013 so-called redundancy, redundant objects. The expression fragility also appears occasionally. AO\u2019s works do not veil some inability, whether related to material and shape or the negligible and mute, but are instances of intentional uncovering of chosen fragilities. VSSD\u2019s activity was often related to \u201csoft\u201d installations \u2013 to ephemeral spatial installations, unrepeatable installations that only lasted for a single exhibition in a chosen gallery. And even though from this point of view AO\u2019s objects are more enduring, inert and not strictly bound to space, they always provoke some kind of fragility, in some cases even redundancy. What is more, VSSD was in a sense extroverted, energetic and powerful, while with AO we\u2019re seeing marginal, redundant objects, even leftovers. Past practice was created by the Artist and those were Artworks \u2013 this is not meant to be a provocation, but it seems that these works intentionally dealt with the institution of art, its context, genre, and history of art \u2013 and in my view the rest is far more marked with someone that fights objects on their own \u2013 an introverted practice, and objects as leftovers of a life. I believe we\u2019re dealing with an essential shift in the author\u2019s\/artist\u2019s position: VSSD occupies the space within \u201cto know\u2011to know\u201d \u2013 the author knows and the object knows (this, of course, does not mean that there was no tension or fighting involved) \u2013 while the other position could be more easily delineated as between \u201cto notknow\u2011to notknow\u201d \u2013 the artist doesn\u2019t know and neither does his object, which is precisely why AO\u2019s objects are not loud and ostentatious. The difference therefore lies between making a statement and questioning something. In some cases, we can also observe the dichotomy between past works, which employ a motive, and the current works, which build on the so\u2011called missing motive. To be more precise: past practice is programmatic \u2013 it is the projecting of an artistic statement and its deployment, it is about fighting with objects, using them to wag a finger at the world. And AO most definitely is a struggle against objects, each work is a fight, and nobody knows who will come out the winner. VSSD fulfils what was set, realizes what was conceived, while AO is a fall from the initial position \u2013 it is not about approaching a goal, but about moving away from a certain point. Here we\u2019re talking about the split between what is set and what is open, and the difference between the author with his creations, his rights and property on the one hand, and on the other a human lost in their midst (which is the reason letters, self\u2011titled texts, descriptions of meeting oneself exist). The initial practice was created by a life, while in the other life is, so to speak, tailored to artistic work \u2013 that is, life is reshaped through practice and is not \u201creflected\u201d in the work. I believe these differences culminate in, or at least establish a parallel between handiness and presence, between operation and stuttering. It is from these viewpoints that redundancy and fragility must be read. The mentioned objects are not fragile in their materiality; structurally speaking, we\u2019re dealing with the emergence or display of fragility in a certain place.     I\u2019ve mentioned that the author\u2019s notes are always parallels to a certain work. In some cases, they\u2019re even personal stories, as Alen calls them, even if he immediately adds that he doesn\u2019t like those. His objects never illustrate or reflect stories, nor do they narrate them; if anything, we could say that they come from them, just as thoughts or visions come from a given moment in life. And just as a notion truly becomes a notion only when it begins to make a passage or movement, when it moves from within itself and folds into itself, so these objects, their multiplication, accumulation, repetition and collection are always another attempt to formalize something \u2013 they are formalizations of a deadlock (sometimes even of divergence, struggle or searching for one\u2019s own place). If we observe them a little more meticulously we also sense that they are a kind of attempt to stop, which is created and launched on special places \u2013 they are stutterings of time, of cultural changes, technology. AO\u2019s works are not an attempt to answer these deadlocks but to make their places present. "

      "text":" Festivalito Rural 2012     Teachers     We are proud to have Melina Sed\u00f3 and Detlef Engel teaching at Festivalito Rural. Again. Here's some basic information about them, copied from their webpage:     Stylistically, they are at home in the traditional tango de sal\u00f3n, as it is danced in Buenos Aires, and which they interpret in a very personal and modern way. Their dance captivates through its intimate embrace, playful musicality and an almost puristic elegance: a sensual interplay of man and woman without clich\u00e9 or superficial effect. Thus, their tango is newly created in every single moment, and does not just express the music, but genuine feeling.     At the core of their lessons, which are always geared towards improvisational capability, are intensive body work and analysis of tango\u00b4s structures. But \u201etechnical\u201c understanding is just a means to concentrate better on the essential: developing one\u00b4s own style and relishing the embrace in unison with the music.     If you need proof that they are welcome in many places around the world, take a look at their references.     If you like to read, check out Melina's blog. In there, you'll find her opinion on almost anything... also on Festivalito Rural ;-)     Finally, if you're more of a visual type, here's a starting point for browsing YouTube: Detlef and Melina dancing to Tormenta of Carlos di Sarli at the Festival de Kerallic in France. Watching the video you will surely realise why a blog linking to this video calls them those masters of control ;-) "

      "text":" The Holy Trinity Chapel, which protects the city, is positioned amongst the vineyards and, as a proud white guardian, looks silently upon Lendava below, with its green planes through which the Lendava stream meanders. Once there was a garrison stationed on this spot, which is strategically very important for the protection of the city.     Due to its strategic position not even the Turks in the 16th and 17th Century were able to invade this place. After the Turkish incursions and battles were over, grateful believers started to build churches and chapels at several sites.     The Holy Trinity Chapel was one of these that was built with similar intentions in 1727\/28. The construction costs were mainly covered by the Gludov\u00e1cz family, who were well-respected.     In the Chapel there is also a naturally mummified body, which has triggered the imagination of the people of Lendava since time immemorial. This mummy has been connected to many legends. According to local tradition, which is based on the fairytale stories from the first half of the 19th Century, there was a legend that in this Chapel rests Captain Mihael Hadik, one of the famous heroes from the battles against the Turks. It is presumed that he fought in a major battle with Turkish troops in 1603, when Lendava was defended by Krist\u00f3f B\u00e1nnfy. "

It will bring together people from AI, Cognitive Science and related areas such as Psychology, Philosophy and the Arts who research questions related to the notion of creativity as it relates to computational systems. This focus on creativity in the context of computational systems has the potential for increasing innovation in existing fields of research as well as for defining new fields of study.     Israel's Nobel winner: People called me a dreamer Israeli scientist Ada Yonath, a leading researcher in the structural biology field, was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday, the Nobel committee in Stockholm announced.     The European Commission today called on Europe's information and communication technologies (ICT) industry to outline by 2011 the practical steps it will take to become 20% more energy efficient by 2015. ICT equipment and services alone account for about 8% of electrical power used in the EU and about 2% of carbon emissions. But using ICT in a smart way could help reducing energy consumption in energy-hungry sectors such as buildings, transport and logistics, and save 15% in total carbon emissions by 2020. The Commission recommends that the ICT sector adopts bold energy efficiency targets by 2011. It also asks EU countries to agree on common specifications for smart metering by the end of 2010.     This event will cover topics such as the European Digital Agenda for 2020; the EU Telecoms Framework Review; copyright; Commission state aid proposals; developments in next generation access policy; regulating in a bundled environment and the digital dividend. Workshops will also focus on data protection, state aid, net neutrality and telecoms issues in Eastern Europe.     Creativity plays an important role in developing intelligent computational systems, it is less clear how to model, simulate, or evaluate creativity in such systems. In other words, it is often easier to recognize the presence and effect of creativity than to describe or prescribe it. The purpose of this conference is to facilitate the exchange of ideas on the topic of computational creativity in a cross-disciplinary setting.     The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. Presenters are leaders in their respective fields, representing industrial, academic and government communities. Leading researchers present their current work, while special sessions focus on the role of women in today's technology fields, including computer science, information technology, research and engineering. Past Grace Hopper Celebrations have resulted in collaborative proposals, networking, mentoring, and increased visibility for the contributions of women in computing.     Two EU-funded projects, ICT-WEB-PROMS and WINS-ICT are jointly organising a \"Training and networking workshop for WB-EU research cooperation in ICT for Learning and eLearning\". The workshop will be organised in the frame of the international event \"4th Balkan Conference in Informatics-BCI 2009\" in Thessaloniki, Greece on 18 September, 2009. Draft agenda of the workshop.     In the midst of the economic crisis, the ICT sector is still growing! It is now the time to prepare for the future and ensure that when the crisis is over, the sector will have the necessary resources to respond to new challenges. At end of the mandate of Commissioner Reding, this gender workshop aims to take stock of the progress made and present new initiatives and actions. Brainstorming sessions are also organised to work towards setting up a new agenda for Women in ICT. Commissioner Reding will launch the Directory of Women in ICT, and interactive platform which brings together all relevant initiatives and information as well as provides a European network of women in the sector. The Commissioner will also present the new signatories of The Code of Best Practices for women in ICT. Participation in the Workshop is free of charge but there is a limited number of places. "

      "text":" KONCERT ZA VIOLINO \/ VIOLIN CONCERTO     Pod visokim bronastim kipom, sredi vzpenjajo\u010dih se stopnic, negibno in vendar v svoji notranjosti valujo\u010de morje obrazov poslu\u0161a Bachov koncert: odmev razse\u017enosti \u010dasa se zdi kot navdih. Stopim iz sence hi\u0161, stoje\u010dih tesno druga ob drugi, in \u017eiva svetloba nad staromestnim trgom malone zaslepi spev.     largo     I     V ogledalu neba se zrcali neskon\u010dnost. Le\u017ee\u0161 na hrbet v mokro travo in opazuje\u0161, kako potuje ro\u017enat oblak v vijoli\u010den somrak. Potem z mislijo, po\u010dasi, \u0161e enkrat obide\u0161 prizor. Kon\u010dnost se odmika v daljavo. Od znotraj prihaja zvok violine. Hite\u010d za zvokom, za odmevom tega zvoka, prispe\u0161 zadihan, ves moker od rose.     II     S toplim nemirom rok bo\u017ea\u0161, kot bo\u017ea otrok grad iz sipine, vzpetine moje razprte golote. Z \u017eejnim vonjem lepote polaga\u0161 na \u017eeljni obok telesa poti, kamor greva objeta, pod brezmejnim lokom drevesa, velikim kot sinja ljubezen dneva. Vseh dni.     III     Soj medene lune sledi poti jezika, ki sredi obale oku\u0161a sok s svile kot cipresa vitkega telesa. Sledi zvezd sredi ko\u017ene jase, okopane v sladkosti vro\u010dice, se izgubljene v kipenju lastnih vzdihov kri\u017eajo na razprti dlani no\u010di. Zaprem o\u010di, vse v meni \u0161\u010demi in utripa. Tema odhaja in zora gori v svetlobo dozorele strasti.     IV     Na postelji, \u0161e topli od ljubljenja, ostaja z meglico zaspanega sonca izslikan odtis. Vdihavam vonj iz rjuhe pome\u010dkane, kjer si le malo prej iz ikebane mojega telesa odpoljubil pesmi, prej \u0161e neprebrane. Skozi lino no\u010di se zlati odhajajo\u010da mese\u010dina in z njo tvoj zapis, Selena, luna, obsijana s svetlobo karmina.     andante     I     V prahu sipkega peska sva pustila goli obris utripov srca, z vitkimi prsti zarisan napis za nevidne bogove neba. Vetrovi, skriti pod krili ptic, podijo kopaste oblake, lebde\u010de nad \u0161irnim zalivom. Ob glasovih milih strun ju\u017enih vetrov, z zlatilom oson\u010dnenih jader, vodi\u0161 belo barko v pristan. Splivkana voda pomirja, bo\u017ea.     II     Z okusom srebrne pene valov zori jutro na belih svilenih prevlekah soli, ki jih \u0161e ni spral de\u017e z odprtega morja. S slutnjo sladkosti svitanja se selim v resni\u010dnost z vrhov najvi\u0161jih slasti, kjer drhtijo sanje. Tvoja ko\u017ea di\u0161i po bakreni zagorelosti, ki se ogreje v pohotnosti vod. Odpiram in zapiram se, \u0161koljka, na poroznih policah, s katerih se morje umika in se vra\u010da nanje.     III     Glas neznanih morskih ptic, ki re\u017ee zati\u0161je spe\u010dega morja, vabi v \u010darne privide, skrite za robom obzorja. Pred zarjo, ki sine, srkam vase magi\u010dne meje slasti, ovite med nevidne \u010deri nebe\u0161kih polj, ki jih prekriva presojna, drhte\u010da tan\u010dica jutranje rose. Na oltar drobnih prsi z vihravo slo kot Eol, bog vetrov, daruje\u0161 oro\u0161eno telo.     IV     Katedralo z dvema zvonikoma in majhnimi starinskimi stolpi\u010di, dvigajo\u010dimi se z ostrimi konicami proti oblakom, in baro\u010dne linije ni\u0161 okoli nje, barva rde\u010dkast nadih. Tvoj dih, ki je usoda, zaspi ob mojem vratu, iz\u010drpan in sladko utrujen. Le vri\u0161\u010d angelskih glasov, napolnjen s po\u017eelenjem, \u0161e vznemirja tiho no\u010d.     allegro vivo     I     Zvok neujemljive domi\u0161ljije nagovarja z nagajivim bli\u0161\u010dem in sijajem. Po kotih terase, na bambusovih pre\u010dnikih, so posejani redki in skrivnostno di\u0161e\u010di cvetovi divje azaleje. Dih sve\u017eine preveva resast \u0161krlat pravlji\u010dne preje in prsi pre\u0161inja velika, nedopovedljivo lepa sre\u010da. Sredi njenih valujo\u010dih glasov se zdim kot posoda, ki jo z grozdjem polni\u0161, Bakhus, da me pije\u0161 sladko, da me mami\u0161.     II     Kot krhko vazo iz porcelana me krasi\u0161 s cvetjem besed in mi \u010dute pretresa\u0161 kot burja, ki plane v je\u010de\u010de bore otoka. Sr\u010dni utrip si, rde\u010da mana, drget, ki me o\u017eivlja, vznemirjenje, ki ude razvezuje. Vihar si, ki polje v meni. Kri. In roka, ki po boku polzi. Na obokih ru\u0161evin z Mane zarana stoka galeb od u\u017eitka.     III     Vsako jutro znova vzide sonce skozi tvoje od sle v tanke re\u017ee priprte o\u010di, iz katerih zeleno vre vse, kar me opaja. Vedrina si, smeh, ki \u0161kreblja po ble\u0161\u010davi zob sredi poletja. Ujeta v trepet tvojih rok, v vsak tvoj zamaknjen pogled in pod zaprtimi vekami v niz podob sem, kot otrok, nemirna v pri\u010dakovanju: kot igriva galeba sva, ki ne i\u0161\u010deva zavetja pod prostranim obokom neba.     IV     Potopljena v oran\u017eno son\u010davo, zamaknjena v ekstazi, otrpla v vonju, ki se skozi pore plazi, se nad pene\u010dim se valom morja loviva s pogledi. V o\u010deh, ki vidijo vse, tudi na videz najnepomembnej\u0161e podrobnosti, je vsak dotik sve\u010dana podoba, ki jo s prsti mehko izpisuje\u0161 po ko\u017ei. Takrat so v zraku, ki ima barvo in vonj tvoje polti, ve\u010deri podobni biserni ro\u017ei.     piano     I     Pro\u010delja ljubkih hi\u0161 in kupole cerkvice, obrnjene proti vzhodu in osvetljene z jutranjo zarjo, barva harmonski akord, rahel in ne\u017een kot prvi poljub. Nemirna svetloba se spu\u0161\u010da iz ozkih oken visoko nad oboki in objema pozlate na baro\u010dnih okvirjih prelepih slik. Na oltarju visi podoba neba, ki ga pokriva devi\u0161ka barva, svetla kot \u017earek v \u017eeljnih o\u010deh. Iz velikih orgel lije lilast slap melodij, ki drhti v razko\u0161ju obljub.     II     Bronast zven zvonov lebdi v mraku. S paleto ob\u010dutkov, vpletenih v svilo dolgih, svetlih las, me razvaja\u0161 do tan\u010din, globoko, v dno vesolja. Dvigujeva se na krilih te lebde\u010de melodije: ko sledi\u0161 premenam v hi\u0161i moje du\u0161e, se vse tvoje bitje vanjo prelije. Kro\u0161nje dreves pojejo v ve\u010dernem zraku.     III     \u010carobna podoba \u017eare\u010dih odbleskov se ble\u0161\u010di od mokrote. V neustavljivem ritmu letiva vi\u0161e in vi\u0161e, do vratu potopljena v neulovljiv odmev potujo\u010dih valov. Spodaj se peni tenko speta mese\u010dina. \u010cisto z vrha odplavam lahno in po\u010dasi kot peresce z neba.     IV     Ob oknu, kjer slutim globino ve\u010dera, trepetajo krila no\u010dnega metulja, na katerih so izvezena ble\u0161\u010de\u010da o\u010desa. V kotu o\u010di se rosi milina. V tvojem naro\u010dju, ljubljena kot violina, vzdignjena v vrh zvezdne ceste, na pobo\u010dju beline neba le s krili lebdim, angel, brez telesa.     Underneath a tall bronze statue, half-way up some climbing steps, a sea of faces, still, but swelling from within, listens to a Bach Concerto: the echoing expanse of time seems like an inspiration. I leave the shadows of the huddling houses, while the vibrant light spilling over the old-town square almost drowns the song.     Largo     I     The mirror of the sky reflects infinity. You lie down on your back in damp grass and watch a pink cloud sail into the violet dusk. Then slowly\u2014in your thoughts\u2014you see it once again. Finitude draws into distance. The sound of violin comes from within. Chasing the sound, the echo of the sound, you arrive, gasping, and covered in dew.     II     With the warm restlessness of hands, you caress, like a child caresses castles out of sand, the mounds of my unfolded bareness. With the hungry smell of beauty, you cover the aching curves of my body with roads which we walk embraced, under the endless arch of the tree, as immense as the azure love of the day. Of all days.     III     The moon\u2019s honey glow on the shore follows the trail of the tongue tasting the sap from the silken body, slender as a cypress tree. Traces of stars in the clearing of skin, bathed in sweet fever, criss-cross the open palm of the night, lost in the seething of their own sighs. I close my eyes; everything within me is burning and pulsing. Darkness is leaving and dawn is burning in the flush of ripe passion.     IV     In the bed still warm from making love, an imprint remains, painted in the mist of a sleepy sun. I breathe in the scent of the crumpled sheet where you\u2019ve just kissed away poems never read before from the ikebana of my body. The waning moonlight gilds the window of night, and your inscription, Selene, Luna, glowing in carmine light.     Andante     I     In the dust of dry sand, we left the naked outlines of our heartbeats, inscriptions made with lean fingers for the invisible gods of the sky. The winds, hidden underneath birds\u2019 wings, chase the fluffy clouds gliding over the expanse of the bay. With the soft voices of southerly winds and golden sunlight in the sails, you steer your boat into the harbour. The rippled water soothes, caresses.     II     Tasting of the waves\u2019 silver foam, the morning ripens on the silky white covers of salt that haven\u2019t been washed away by the rains from the open sea. With the premonition of sweet dawn I move to reality from the highest heights of ecstasy, the place of trembling dreams. Your skin smells of the copper tan heated in lustful waters. I open and close, a seashell on the porous ledges from which the sea pulls back, only to take them again.     III     The voice of strange seabirds that cuts the calm of the sleeping sea lures into charmful visions hiding behind the horizon. Before the breaking of dawn, I soak up the magic limits of ecstasy spun round the invisible rocks in the heavenly fields, covered by the translucent, shivering veil of the morning dew. At the altar of small breasts you offer up your dewy body with the tumultuous lust of Aeolus, god of the winds.     IV     The cathedral with two bell towers and small ancient turrets rising in sharp pinnacles towards the clouds, and the baroque lines of the encircling niches, are glowing in a reddish hue. Your breath, my destiny, sleeps against my neck, worn out with sweet exhaustion. Only the cries of angelic voices, full of lust, disturb the quiet night.     Allegro vivo     I     The sound of uncatchable imagination speaks with playful lustre and spark. In the corners of the terrace, on bamboo canes, a few blossoms of the mysteriously smelling wild azalea are dotted around. A whiff of freshness breathes through the fringed purple of fairy-tale yarn and my chest is imbued with great, unspeakably beautiful happiness. Amid its swelling voices, I seem like a vessel you fill with grapes, Bacchus, to dink me sweet, to tempt me.     II     You adorn me like a fragile porcelain vase with blossoms of words and shake my senses like the northerly wind that rushes into the moaning pines of the island. You are a heartbeat, red manna, a shudder of life, a thrill untying my limbs. A tempest that swells in me. Blood. A hand that slides down my hip. From the arches of the ruins on Mana, a seagull cries out with pleasure.     III     Each morning anew the sun rises through your eyes, narrowed into slits with lust, and everything gushes out greenly and sates me. You are brightness, laughter tingling on the sparkle of teeth in high summer. I am caught in the trembling of your hands, in your every pensive gaze, and in a line of images under closed eyelids, like a child, restless in expectation: we are like playful seagulls that do not look for shelter under the expanse of the sky.     IV     Immersed in the orange sunglow, entranced in ecstasy, numbed by the scent crawling through the pores, we catch each other\u2019s eye over the white-capped waves. In the eyes that see everything, even the seemingly most unimportant details, every touch is a solemn image that your fingers softly outline on my skin. Then the air, with the hue and scent of your tan, seems like a blossom of pearl.     Piano     I     The fronts of charming houses and the cupola of the little church facing east, lit up with the morning dawn, are coloured by a harmonic chord, soft and gentle like a first kiss. Restless light is moving down from narrow windows high above the arches, embracing the gold on the baroque frames of wonderful paintings. At the altar, an image of the heavens hangs, covered in virginal colour, bright as the glimmer in hungry eyes. From the great organ pours a purple cascade of melody, quivering in the plenty of promise.     II     The bronze chime of bells hangs in the air. With a palette of senses, entwined in the silk of long fair hair, you indulge my every fibre, profoundly, to the deepest depths of the universe. We rise on the wings of this gliding melody: as you follow the movements in the house of my soul, all your being pours into it. Treetops sing in the evening air.     III     The magic image of glowing reflections is glistening with wetness. In an unstoppable rhythm we fly higher and higher, immersed to our necks in the unchatchable echo of travelling waves. Underneath, the soft-woven moonlight sparkles. From the very top, I swim down gently and slowly, like a feather from the sky.     IV     By the window, where I feel the deep of the evening, the wings of a night butterfly flutter, embroidered with gleamy eyespots. In the corner of the eye, grace is gathering in a drop. In your arms, loved like a violin, lifted to the top of the stars, on the slope of the whiteness of sky, I glide on nothing but wings, an angel, bodiless. "

      "text":" Phone:     Mobile phone:     E-mail:     Web page:     \"Ascetic figures distributed in front of the spatial setting and bared to the bones have long been the distinctive feature of Vozelj's authentic style. The most recent oil paintings continue to adhere to the same artistic interpretation of the specific, sometimes even closed, perceptual world, even though, over time, muscles and skirt have subtly covered the framework. The dynamic figures remain typified and affect us as distant and asexual despite the soft approach and warm incarnate depiction. If we look fur help among the representational patterns of general iconography, the sym-bolic language of rare forms and allegories can explain the artist's apparent, perhaps illogical love of the forms that are less often encountered, and then usually only as attributes in certain traditional collocations. It is not difficult to establish that the focus of Vozelj's interest in the human body, without denying the psychological factor, is the physical and material side of the body, its ability to move and its endeavours to dominate space, which is distinctly abstract, artificial and shows no tendency to simulate depth in his paintings. As a rule, figures escape from or into the picture in vigorous leaps, bends and turns, so that they occasionally strike us as depicting the elegant motion of sportsmen. We probably cannot assign to them ritual gestures that could be implied by similar postures, but this manner of depiction can be safely related to the symbolic tendency towards freedom that transcends the everyday course of life, to nonconformism and motion, to disruption of the statics, and hence progression. The interpretation of the meaning of the bones, which are mistakenly understood only as the metaphor of death and evil, is rather unifirm in various iconographic models. Being the constructional element of the body, the bone is its basic and therefore inevitable part, hence the symbol of firmness and strength, and the primeval element of being. From this arises a belief in the indestructibility of the bone, it's durability and regenerative capacity, thanks to which a being as a complex creature is immortal, but only in this form.\" "

A novel mobile preconcentration system, based on the use of multi-adsorbent sample tubes, has been developed for trapping relatively large-volume air samples in potentially remote areas. An Adsorption Desorption System-Gas Chromatography-Electron Capture Detector was used to measure the mixing ratios of the selected halocarbon species, while a Gas ChromatographyCombustionIsotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer was used to determine \u220213C values. For the species with strong local sources, the variation of isotope ratios has been observed over the experimental period. Some of the results reported in the present study differ from previously reported values and reasons for this are discussed. The reporting of different \u220213C values for selected halocarbons from different areas in the present study suggests that \u220213C values may be used to determine the relative magnitudes of anthropogenic and biogenic sources.

Time series and seasonal variations of the halocarbons were analysed over the period to determine biogenic and anthropogenic sources and sinks. Correlations between the target halocarbons were also observed, suggesting common sources within the area. Wind rose plots for all halocarbons have been used to assist in the determination of halocarbons sources. Halocarbon concentrations are highest at low\u2010wind speeds and decrease as wind speed increases, a few species (CCl4 and CH3Cl most notably) rise at very high\u2010wind speeds suggesting release from the Bristol Channel.

Dru\u0161tvo 2000 (\"Association 2000\") was established in 1969 by a group of students who adhered to personalistic philosophy and principles of social movements. The group initially focused on the publication of Revija 2000 journal and later began organising symposia, lectures, and discussions. In collaboration with Cankarjev dom Culture and Congress Centre, round table discussions on current social topics have been held.     In addition to having published Revija 2000 for 40 years, the association is active in publishing basic literature related to personalistic philosophy and social, political and national issues written by Slovene authors, such as Tine Hribar, and foreign ones. They have launched numerous literary works, including diaries and letters by Ivan Mrak and poetry by Josip Osti, as well as an anthology on aboriginal poetry and a collection of papers on Edvard Kocbek. Some of the foreign authors included in their publishing programme have been: Martin Buber, Simone Weil, Talal Hadi, and Gibran Khalil Gibran. New titles are usually complemented by presentations and press conferences, and available in most major bookstores in Slovenia. Their website features short descriptions of their books.

Kanada: Zdravniki morajo zagotavljati evtanazijo, ali pa so kaznovani!     01.02.2018     Iz Kanade prihajajo vedno bolj zaskrbljujo\u010de novice. Tamkaj\u0161nja dru\u017eba postaja vedno bolj nestrpna do vseh, ki se zavzemajo za nemo\u010dne, dru\u017eino in otroke. Zadnja novica je povezana s finan\u010dnim kaznovanjem katoli\u0161kih zdravnikov, ki ne bodo zagotavljali dostopa do evtanazije.     Ontario court forces Christian pro-life doctors to refer patients for euthanasia     TORONTO, January 31, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013 An Ontario Court ruled today that doctors who oppose euthanasia must nevertheless act contrary to their beliefs and refer patients making a euthanasia request to a physician who will end their lives.     Critics say the ruling puts physicians in an \u201cimpossible position\u201d and has ramifications for Charter rights of freedom of religion and conscience for all Ontario citizens.     Three justices of the Ontario Superior Court unanimously agreed Wednesday that the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) policy requiring doctors to \u201ceffectively\u201d refer patients for medical practices they conscientiously object to \u2014 notably euthanasia and abortion \u2014 does, in fact, violate their Charter right to religious freedom.     But the court ruled that in light of the goal of \u201censuring access to health care\u201d the CPSO effective referral policy presents \"reasonable limit on religious freedom, demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\u201d     An effective referral is one to an accessible colleague who is willing to provide the morally objectionable \u201cprocedure.\u201d     Likewise, the CPSO policy requesting conscientiously objecting physicians to commit euthanasia or abortion themselves in unspecified \u201cemergency\u201d situations is also reasonable, the judges held.     The 46-page decision, written by Justice Herman Wilton-Siegal in concurrence with Justices Richard Lococo and Wendy Matheson, held that \u201cthe evidence in the record establishes a real risk of a deprivation of equitable access to health care, particularly on the part of the more vulnerable members of our society, in the absence of the effective referral requirements.\u201d     The ruling noted that while the CPSO policies are \u201cnot trivial\u201d and \u201cmay require an accommodation\u201d on the doctors\u2019 part, they do not \u201cextend to deprivation of the ability to practice medicine in Ontario.\u201d     But that\u2019s not true, say the doctors who took the CPSO to court, and who denounced the January 31 ruling in a joint press release Wednesday.     The court\u2019s decision puts doctors \u201cwho entered the field of medicine to provide quality, compassionate, and patient-centered care\u201d in \u201can impossible position,\u201d said Dr. Ryan Wilson, president of the Canadian Physicians for Life (CPL).     \u201cThey don\u2019t believe ending a patient\u2019s life is medicine, and they don\u2019t believe they can offer hope and healing in one room while assisting in killing a patient in another,\u201d he said.     CPL joined the Canadian Federation of Catholic Physicians\u2019 Societies (CFCPS), the Christian Medical and Dental Society of Canada (CMDSC) and five Christian doctors to launch the Charter challenge, which was argued in Toronto over three days last June.     The lengthy hearing was necessary to allow for eight intervenors.     These included the Liberal government of Ontario, Dying with Dignity Canada, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Catholic Bishops of Ontario, the Catholic Civil Rights League, the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedom, the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, the Canadian HIV\/AIDS Legal Network, and the Canadian Professional Association for Transgender Health.     The ruling confirms for many doctors that their \u201creligious and conscience rights are being violated and they won\u2019t be able to practice medicine in Ontario,\u201d Wilson said.     \u201cThis is a significant loss for the entire health care system in the province and will have a direct impact on patient care,\u201d he warned. \u201cUltimately it is patient care that suffers, as our doctors will retire early, relocate, or change fields.\u201d     This was echoed by CFCPS president Dr. Jim Lane.     \u201cThis decision forces many Ontario doctors to be unable to care for their patients. This decision also raises alarm bells to all health care workers and Ontario residents that their freedom of religion and conscience could also be jeopardized,\u201d he said.     Larry Worthen, executive director of the CMDSC, noted the ruling underscores the increasing marginalization of Christians in Canadian society.     \u201cCanada represents itself on the world stage as being a cultural mosaic. This is evidence that we are losing sight of that reality,\u201d Worthen said. \u201cTo say we respect all cultures and beliefs, we need to respect their strongly held moral convictions.\u201d     Worthen also pointed to apparent inconsistencies in the judgment.     The court \u201cheld that other jurisdictions had chosen less restrictive means of ensuring access\u201d to the morally objectionable practices such as euthanasia and abortion, that there was \u201cno evidence that conscientious objection ever results in a failure of access\u201d to these practices, and that \u201cthe implications for physicians were serious and more than trivial or insubstantial,\u201d he said.     \u201cWe are left wondering why an effective referral is necessary,\u201d Worthen added.     The ruling is an \u201calarming development which places Ontario doctors at the risk of professional complaints for refusing to make such referrals,\u201d says Phil Horgan, president of the Catholic Civil rights League, which intervened in the case.     \u201cWe have maintained that the CPSO\u2019s insistence on compelling Ontario physicians to perform an \u2018effective referral\u2019 for objectionable procedures does nothing to honour the Charter right of freedom of conscience and religion,\u201d Horgan told LifeSiteNews in an email.     \u201cRather it is a breach of a physician\u2019s rights and a serious incursion into the professional standing of a physician,\u201d he said.     Derek Ross, Executive Director & General Counsel of The Christian Legal Fellowship called the ruling \"unconscionable .\"     \"Requiring someone to participate against their will in ending another person's life is unconscionable in a free and democratic society. Such coercion in any context violates human dignity, an inviolable right which is not extinguished simply because one practices in a regulated profession,\" he said.     \"It is difficult to comprehend how it could possibly be in the 'public interest' to pressure doctors to either compromise their core ethical convictions or abandon their area of medicine. Neither is a good outcome for Ontario patients, especially in light of the Court's acceptance that 'there is no study or direct evidence that demonstrates that access to health care is, or was, a problem that was caused by physicians objecting on religious or conscientious grounds to the provision of referrals for their patients,\" he added.     Worthen says the doctors are \u201ccurrently reviewing our options regarding an appeal.\u201d     Komentarji     Va\u0161e mnenje     Ali ste vedeli, da vsakemu nerojenemu otroku bije srce \u017ee od 3 tedna po spo\u010detju naprej?

For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe.

Ljubljana They say that Ljubljana is Europe in miniature as it is situated at the dynamic crossroads of the Germanic, Roman and Slavic worlds. It connects the prehistory of pile-dwellers with the 2000-year-old Roman Emona, the medieval centre below the castle hill with rich Baroque fa\u00e7ades, the beauties of Art Nouveau with the creations of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, significant architect and urbanist of Europe. The mosaic is completed by the picturesque bridges and green embankments of the Ljubljanica River. According to the legend, Ljubljana was established by the mythological hero Jason, who travelled with the stolen Golden Fleece across the Black Sea and up the rivers Danube, Sava and finally Ljubljanica, all the way to its spring. There was supposedly a large lake, where a monster lived, which Jason defeated and killed. The monster entered into national folklore as the Ljubljana dragon, which today dwells on Ljubljana's city coat-of-arms and on the Dragon Bridge. Ljubljana has 287,000 inhabitants and ranks among the smaller European capitals. They say that it is easier to walk all around it than pronounce its name. It is a city that has love in its name. If you say the word \u201cljubljena (the loved one)\u201d in Slovenian, it sounds the same as Ljubljana \u2013 for those who really get to know Ljubljana, both words also have the same meaning.     Ljubljana, European Green Capital 2016 Ljubljana is a city with a green soul and the holder of the prestigious European Green Capital 2016 title. A decade ago, we started to implement the \u201cVision 2025\u201d strategy in which we committed to develop the city in a sustainable manner and pay attention to the environment and the people living in it. One hundred larger infrastructural projects and in total as many as 600 green projects have been carried out in recent years. As many as four regional parks grace the Ljubljana area, while the largest city park, Tivoli, reaches into the city centre. You can explore the city\u2019s special features on foot or by city bicycle; in the narrower streets of the city centre you can take a free ride with the Kavalir electric-powered vehicle. The Path of Remembrance and Comradeship, which encircles the entire city, is the city\u2019s longest tree-lined lane with more than 7,000 trees. In the tourist information centres you can choose among numerous guided tours and experiences of the green Ljubljana. Ljubljana is also a city distinguished by clean drinking water. On the city streets, you can quench your thirst for free at public drinking fountains, which operate in the warmer months from April to October. Every sunny Friday from March to the end of October, the Ljubljana city centre hosts the exciting Open Kitchen event, a unique food market featuring freshly prepared delights.     We are approaching the stop for LJUBLJANA CASTLE     The Ljubljana Castle has been a distinctive symbol of the city for as many as 900 years. At first it was a fort, then the seat of the regional governor, later on a barracks and even a prison, and today it is the main city attraction and a stunning cultural landmark with a rich content. Explore the castle! You can choose an immersive guided tour with costumed characters, entitled \u201cTime Machine: from Emona to a City Symbol\u201d or set out for your own exploration of the castle with the help of an audio guide. You can start at the Info Centre in Erazem\u2019s Tower. Climb the Viewing Tower to admire a beautiful view, get to know the castle with the help of a tactile model of the castle, explore the history of the castle at the Penitentiary exhibition, take a look at the development of the castle in the Virtual Castle projection \u2013 up until its present image. Travel through the millennia of the settlement of Ljubljana with the iLjubljana exhibition and learn more about Slovenia at the Slovenian History exhibition. Indulge in a fun and educational travel through the rich treasure trove of Slovenian puppetry and visit the Museum of Puppetry. Neat pathways, intertwined all over the castle hill, invite you to enjoy relaxed walks. For a culinary stop you can choose between the castle coffee house, Na gradu restaurant and Strelec restaurant, while the castle shop offers souvenirs of your visit to take home. As a city situated at the dynamic crossroads of various cultures, regions and historical events, Ljubljana is also a real cultural capital. It is known for the architecture of Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, who among other projects also designed the architecture of Prague and Vienna. The imprint that Ple\u010dnik left on the city of his birth, Ljubljana, after he had returned from abroad in 1921 \u2013 50 years old and thinking that there was no more special future ahead of him \u2013 is so distinctive and ineradicable that Ple\u010dnik\u2019s Ljubljana as a unique urban specialty is one of the most original and significant total works of art of the 20th century to be found anywhere in the world. Ljubljana is distinguished by a harmonious coexistence of stately tradition and modern tempo \u2013 it is a lively centre of creativity where culture is practically the way of life. Every year there are more than 10,000 cultural events in the city, including leading music, theatre and art productions as well as alternative and avant-garde occasions \u2013 many being free of charge. In the summertime, when life moves to the streets, its Mediterranean character comes to the fore. They say that Ljubljana is like a lively living room, where we can easily choose our favourite event, savour the authentic Ljubljana dishes under the name Taste Ljubljana and relax and enjoy.     Slovenija Slovenia is a young country but with a rich history and culture. The Slavs, who moved from the Carpathians to the area of today\u2019s Slovenia in the 6th century, established the oldest known Slovenian state, the principality of Carantania, as early as in the 7th century. The 9th century saw the creation of the Freising manuscripts, the earliest preserved writings in the Slovenian language and the earliest texts in Latin script in any of the Slavic languages. Up until the 20th century, Slovenia was in the draught of the European monarchies, most of the time as part of the Habsburg or, later on, the Austro-Hungarian Empire; however, Slovenians formed their national and cultural identity and preserved their language during that period. After World War I, Slovenia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and after World War II, part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1991, after a thousand years, Slovenians got their own independent country, the Republic of Slovenia, which is a member of the European Union and the NATO alliance since 2004. It has 2 million inhabitants and covers 20,273 km2 \u2013 despite its smallness, Slovenia is the only European country which combines the Alps and the Mediterranean, the Karst and the Pannonian Basin. It is Ljubljana that connects these various geographical regions at the intersection itself and right in the centre of Slovenia. More than half of Slovenia's surface is covered by forests, which makes it the largest most wooded country in Europe. More than a third of Slovenia is part of the European network of special nature protection areas Natura 2000. It is considered one of the most watery and biodiverse European countries. The Slovenian coast of the Adriatic Sea is 46.6 kilometres long \u2013 and it is right here that the Mediterranean reaches most deeply into the European continent in the form of the Adriatic Sea. Karst is one of Slovenia\u2019s special features \u2013 all such phenomena in the world are named after the Slovenian region with this name.     We are approaching the stop for \u0160PICA (and Botanical Garden)     The \u0160pica embankment used to be a popular bathing area in Ljubljana. It still looks like a beach today due to its pleasant green and wooden surfaces, where the inhabitants and visitors of Ljubljana like to catch the sun on beautiful days. The name \u0160pica (\u201cpointed tip\u201d) refers to the pointed shape of the land, which the Ljubljanica River creates here. In the vicinity you can visit the Botanical Garden, one of the oldest of its kind in Europe. It was established as early as 1810, at the time of Napoleon's Illyrian Provinces. Even Marshal Marmont himself, the first and main governor of the Illyrian Provinces, attended its opening and planted a linden tree, which nowadays still reigns in the arboretum area of the garden. More than 4,500 species, subspecies and forms of plants grow in the garden. From 140 to 180 botanical gardens order seeds of different plants from here, therefore the Ljubljana Botanical Garden dispatches more than 2,000 packages all around the world every year. In this verdant oasis, also considered the green soul of Ljubljana, you can relax in the attractive Primula tea room.     River Ljubljanica Another icon indelibly marks Ljubljana \u2013 the Ljubljanica River. As it is a sinking river and appears under different names on the surface, people started to call it the \u201criver of seven names\u201d. It presented the main trade and supply route from Roman times until the establishment of the railway in the mid-19th century. Due to its extraordinary archaeological, historical and cultural-historical features, it has been declared a cultural monument of national importance from its springs to the \u0160pica area. With its green embankments, arranged promenades and diverse bridges, it winds through the old part of Ljubljana and gives it a distinctive character.     We are approaching the stop for TRNOVSKI PRISTAN     The Trnovski Pristan embankment, designed by the architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, is a unique architectural creation with its broad stone steps descending towards the river and one of the most beautiful promenades in Ljubljana. In recent years, it has also become a popular place for socialising. Younger generations, in particular, tend to say on nice summer days that they are going to hang out on the \u201cLjubljana beach\u201d.     We are approaching the stop for JO\u017dE PLE\u010cNIK's HOUSE     Enter the house where Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik lived and created from 1921 to his death in 1957. This is the place where the idea of Ple\u010dnik's Ljubljana came to life. The house displays the architect's home with all original interior and exterior equipment and a permanent museum exhibition. In the vicinity, there is the neo-Romanic Trnovo Chruch, which is worth seeing. One of Ljubljana's most famous romantic stories is also connected to the history of the church. In front of the church France Pre\u0161eren, the most important Slovenian poet, met his muse Julija Primic for the first time and fell in love with her immediately.     Roman Wall On our left, in Mirje, there is the southern side of the Emona walls, preserved for almost its entire length. These walls, built in 14 and 15 AD in the form of a rectangle, once surrounded Emona, a Roman settlement that stood where the centre of Ljubljana is today. They had twenty six towers and four main doors. The wall structure was so solid and strong that it endured for as many as 2,000 years at certain places. The Roman Wall, as this largest remnant of the Roman Emona is called, was renovated in the 1930s according to the plans of the architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik. His works consist of the stone pyramid, additions to the walls, entrances and the arched area, which is covered with stone from the nearby antique buildings.     Krakovo (historically important town district) The area of Krakovo is spreading out in front of us, bearing witness to the close intertwinement of Ljubljana and nature \u2013 in the Middle Ages, people here made a living with gardening and fishing. The inhabitants of Krakovo are even today known as the ones who supply Ljubljana and its central market with fresh vegetables.     We are approaching the stop for KRI\u017dANKE (Church and Monastery Complex of Kri\u017eanke)     Slovenians are one of the rare nations who celebrated Napoleon\u2019s arrival and occupation. The Trg francoske revolucije square (French Revolution Square) features a monument to Napoleon\u2019s Illyria. However, the square is most notable for Kri\u017eanke, a former monastery complex of the Knights of the Cross and today a popular summer theatre \u2013 another work on which Ple\u010dnik left his mark during its redesign in the 1950s. It also hosts the shows of the Ljubljana Festival, which has been held since 1952. The lower end of the square is lined by the palace of the dukes Auersperg, which today houses the City Museum of Ljubljana, and nearby there is the National and University Library of Ljubljana, probably the most important of Ple\u010dnik\u2019s oeuvre in Slovenia.     We are approaching the stop for KONGRESNI TRG (Congress Square)     The site of the present square previously featured a small square back in the Baroque period and it was thoroughly reconstructed for the Congress of the Holy Alliance in 1821, after which it was also named. Today it is one of the most important squares of Ljubljana, lined with the Slovenian Philharmonic building, the seat of the University of Ljubljana and the architectural pearl, the Baroque Ursuline Church. In the summertime, the square hosts several events.     We are approaching the stop for PARLIAMENT     The National Assembly Building together with the Trg republike square (Republic Square) is the political centre of Slovenia and the centre of modern Ljubljana. The square was designed by the architect Edvard Ravnikar in 1960. The centre of the square features Cankarjev dom cultural and congress centre \u2013 the main Slovenian cultural institution, while the platform on the square is intended for events and gatherings. It is where Slovenian independence was announced on 25 June 1991. From here you can head towards the National Museum of Slovenia \u2013 in the park in front of this central Slovenian historical museum there is a monument to the renowned Slovenian polymath and scientist Janez Vajkard Valvasor.     We are approaching the stop for OPERA     The Ljubljana Opera House was built at the end of the 19th century in a neo-Renaissance design. The building\u2019s distinctive appearance is decorated by two niches housing allegoric sculptures of tragedy and comedy. The building is the main Slovenian musical theatre today. A modernistic extension at the rear of the opera building was constructed in 2011 due to the lack of space. This stop is the best starting point for visiting the central Ljubljana park, Tivoli, and the International Centre of Graphic Arts at the Tivoli Mansion, the National Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art.     We are approaching the stop for AJDOV\u0160\u010cINA (Slovenska cesta road)     We are arriving at the Slovenska cesta road, Ljubljana's key avenue, which came to prominence after being transformed from a traffic road to an area intended especially for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport. The Ljubljana Neboti\u010dnik (Slovenian for \u201cSkyscraper\u201d) is on the left, an honourable example of architecture from the period between the world wars. At the time of its construction it was the largest building in the Balkans and the ninth highest in Europe, while today it is known that a visit to the terrace on the top of Neboti\u010dnik offers the most beautiful views over Ljubljana.     On Secession Ljubljana is a city of diverse architectural styles. One of the strongest influences to leave a mark on Ljubljana is Art Nouveau, which was established in Ljubljana more than a decade after the devastating earthquake of 1895. The majority of the Art Nouveau buildings was constructed along the Miklo\u0161i\u010deva ulica street, between the Ljubljana railway station and the old city centre. Especially typical are the fa\u00e7ades of buildings, particularly their ornamentation; the most famous ones are the work of Maks Fabiani, one of the founders of modern architecture in Vienna, who also worked extensively in Ljubljana.     Pre\u0161ernov trg square \/ Triple Bridge The route leads us towards the most famous square in Ljubljana, the Pre\u0161ernov trg square, with the statue of the most important Slovenian poet, France Pre\u0161eren. The square is distinguished by the Franciscan Church and the connection to the Triple Bridge and Ple\u010dnik\u2019s market halls with Saint Nicholas\u2019 Cathedral. And that brings us to our starting point, the Town Hall, one of the city\u2019s more distinct Baroque sights and the seat of the City Municipality of Ljubljana. Dear passengers, our common journey ends here, but you will surely wish to continue your discovery of Ljubljana. We were happy to have you as our guests. For more information on Ljubljana and Slovenia visit one of the tourist information centres by the Triple Bridge or by the central market.     We wish you a pleasant stay in our city and goodbye!     Modifications for people with disabilities     There is a separate space aboard the Urban electric train modified to accommodate people with disabilities. People on electric wheelchairs are invited to announce their trip by calling 01 58 22 427 beforehand.

To je bil prvi \"nastop\" Kuzma Stabi gramofona na BBC radiu.

When a group of us listened together this flaw was frequently interpreted as an over driven microphone or over saturated tape. Whatever verbal term used to describe this error, it became an accepted part of that recording. Cleaning with best methods and great attention to adjustments did not always resolve the problem and this continued with multiple tonearms and cartridges, in some cases for many years.     That changed once the Kuzma 4 Point 14\" was set up to perfection, at which point these problems were rendered less obvious and in some cases were resolved completely.     The best way I can describe this, I am now getting greater dynamic range with peaks that are not only louder but I'm also hearing an improvement in resolution within that dynamic. This higher peak sound pressure level replaces a previously compressed, clipped or distorted portion of that recording. This improvement is unique, something I've never encountered to this extent with any other tonearm. It sometimes requires long term listening to notice because it's either very slight or we've become accustomed to it and have no expectation it can be improved.     \"The Kuzma arm gets out of the way so well it makes good cartridges sound better, and really good cartridges sound fantastic!\"     in zaklju\u010dkom:     \"Highly recommended, and a new reference point irrespective of cost-this might just be the best arm you can buy today.\" \" Zelo priporo\u010dljivo in nova referenca za ro\u010dice, ne glede na ceno in mogo\u010de celo najbolj\u0161a ro\u010dica, ki jo lahko danes sploh kupite.\"     V reviji v blogu TAS pi\u0161e J.

      "text":" Classes are held individually throughout the year (from October to July), usually onceor twice a week for 45minutes (The number and length of classes can also be arranged individually). In the summer, workshops dubbed the \u00bbintensive package\u00ab are organised, comprising a sequence of 10 successive classes.     Learning natural singing and voice nurturing provides help, support and guidelines in the research, cognition and development of one's own sound quality with respect and stimulation of the unique character of each individual. It is designed to suit anyone, regardless of their age, musical knowledge, development of their musical ear, singing ambitions \u2026     Throwing the ball, relaxed movement for a relaxed voice. (Pr\u017ean, Ljubljana, 2007)     Natural singing is relaxed singing without any kind of constraint when your whole body resonates as an attuned instrument what is pure joy. Your voice is released of all convulsiveness, blockages and restraints of physical, emotional or mental origin. For the voice holds within it the sound quality of the entire personality and is not simply a product of the physical body.     Unrelaxed states, convulsions during singing (and speaking!) present obstacles to the equable flow of energies, air and free oscillation of the vocal chords, which in turn causes tension, voice tiredness, raucousness, diminishes the expression capacities \u2026 and even causes physical damage to the vocal or singing organs. To nurture voice means to listen to your inner voice, which is an instrument, and ,enable it to sound in all its magnitude, through conscious relaxation and correct breathing. In this way your voice gains gleam, density, its piercing tone and clarity to stand out in all the colours given to each individual, Our voice is our card of identity, given that it also reflects all our momentary states \u2013 physical, emotional and mental. Moreover, by getting to know our own voice, we recognise and gain awareness of our inner states. That is why the relaxation techniques of your throat and the lessons of natural singing are also therapeutic and heal you from the inside out, your body and mind.     The lessons of natural singing and voice nurturing provide help and support at the research, cognition and development of your own voice, as well as yourself as a person. . They are designed for anyone, regardless of their age, musical knowledge, the development of their musical ear, their singing ambitions ...     Mojka \u017dagar (Ro\u017ena dolina, Ljubljana, 2016)     The work is organised on individual basis and comprises exercises in relaxation, breathing, diction, melodics, taking into account the \u00bbgolden rules\u00ab of natural speech and singing and what's more, the abilities and talents of each individual. With regular exercise and attention, the liberated speech and singing become a way of life that opens the door for other fields of self-cognisance and self-realisation.     Class enrollment is not limited to the beginning of the school year. If you are interested and would like to develop your vocal abilities, contact me on +386 40 870 155 or write me an email to info@mojka.si and arrange a free introductory meeting and gain new experience.

Project attempts explicitly to do away with any barriers between the public, semi-public and private features which are all present in this hybrid design. By retaining the huge public forecourt, the programme along the existing building is verticalized, thus giving it a new fa\u00e7ade, designed like boxes piled on top of each other. Fitted between two fronts, as if the public forecourt had been suddenly straightened, is a vertical hall, espousing the principle of continuity and interaction between the two parts of the programme.

      "text":" Forefoot strikers exhibit lower running-induced knee loading than rearfoot strikers     Abstract Purpose. Knee pain and Achilles tendinopathies are the most common complaints among runners. The differences in the running mechanics may play an important role in the pathogenesis of lower limb overuse injuries. However, the effect of a runner's foot strike pattern on the ankle and especially on the knee loading is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether runners using a forefoot strike pattern exhibit a different lower limb loading profile than runners who use rearfoot strike pattern. Methods. Nineteen female athletes with a natural forefoot strike pattern and pair-matched females with rearfoot strike pattern (n = 19) underwent 3D running analysis at 4 m\/s. Joint angles and moments, patellofemoral contact forces and stresses, and Achilles tendon forces were analyzed and compared between groups. Results. Forefoot strikers demonstrated 1ower patellofemoral contact force and stress compared to heel strikers (4.3 +\/- 1.2 vs. 5.1 +\/- 1.1 body weight, BW; P = 0.029 and 11.1 +\/- 2.9 vs. 13.0 +\/- 2.8 Mpa; P = 0.04). In addition, knee frontal plane moment was lower in the forefoot strikers compared heel strikers (1.49 +\/- 0.51 vs. 1.97 +\/- 0.66 Nm\/kg; P = 0.015). At the ankle level, forefoot strikers showed higher plantarflexor moment (3.12 +\/- 0.40 vs. 2.54 +\/- 0.37 Nm\/kg; P = 0.001) and Achilles tendon force (6.3 +\/- 0.8 vs. 5.1 +\/- 1.3 BW; P = 0.002) compared to rearfoot strikers. Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show differences in patellofemoral loading and knee frontal plane moment between forefoot and rearfoot strikers. Forefoot strikers exhibit both lower patellofemoral stress and knee frontal plane moment than rearfoot strikers which may reduce the risk of running-related knee injuries. On the other hand, parallel increase in ankle plantarflexor and Achilles tendon loading may increase risk for ankle and foot injuries.     The human metabolic response to chronic ketosis without caloric restriction: preservation of submaximal exercise capability with reduced carbohydrate oxidation.     Abstract To study the effect of chronic ketosis on exercise performance in endurance-trained humans, five well-trained cyclists were fed a eucaloric balanced diet (EBD) for one week providing 35-50 kcal\/kg\/d, 1.75 g protein\/kg\/d and the remainder of kilocalories as two-thirds carbohydrate (CHO) and one-third fat. This was followed by four weeks of a eucaloric ketogenic diet (EKD), isocaloric and isonitrogenous with the EBD but providing less than 20 g CHO daily. Both diets were appropriately supplemented to meet the recommended daily allowances for vitamins and minerals. Pedal ergometer testing of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was unchanged between the control week (EBD-1) and week 3 of the ketogenic diet (EKD-3). The mean ergometer endurance time for continuous exercise to exhaustion (ENDUR) at 62%-64% of VO2max was 147 minutes at EBD-1 and 151 minutes at EKD-4. The ENDUR steady-state RQ dropped from 0.83 to 0.72 (P less than 0.01) from EBD-1 to EKD-4. In agreement with this were a three-fold drop in glucose oxidation (from 15.1 to 5.1 mg\/kg\/min, P less than 0.05) and a four-fold reduction in muscle glycogen use (0.61 to 0.13 mmol\/kg\/min, P less than 0.01). Neither clinical nor biochemical evidence of hypoglycemia was observed during ENDUR at EKD-4. These results indicate that aerobic endurance exercise by well-trained cyclists was not compromised by four weeks of ketosis. This was accomplished by a dramatic physiologic adaptation that conserved limited carbohydrate stores (both glucose and muscle glycogen) and made fat the predominant muscle substrate at this submaximal power level.     First Human Tests of New Biosensor That Warns When Athletes Are About to 'Hit the Wall'     July 24, 2013 \u2014 A new biosensor, applied to the human skin like a temporary tattoo, can alert marathoners, competitive bikers and other \"extreme\" athletes that they're about to \"bonk,\" or \"hit the wall,\" scientists are reporting. The study, in ACS' journal Analytical Chemistry, describes the first human tests of the sensor, which also could help soldiers and others who engage in intense exercise -- and their trainers -- monitor stamina and fitness.     Joseph Wang and colleagues explain that the sensor monitors lactate, a form of lactic acid released in sweat. Lactate forms when the muscles need more energy than the body can supply from the \"aerobic\" respiration that suffices during mild exercise. The body shifts to \"anaerobic\" metabolism, producing lactic acid and lactate. That helps for a while, but lactate builds up in the body, causing extreme fatigue and the infamous \"bonking out,\" where an athlete just cannot continue. Current methods of measuring lactate are cumbersome, require blood samples or do not give instant results. Wang's team sought to develop a better approach.     They describe the first human tests of a lactate sensor applied to the skin like a temporary tattoo that stays on and flexes with body movements. Tests on 10 human volunteers showed that the sensor accurately measured lactate levels in sweat during exercise. \"Such skin-worn metabolite biosensors could lead to useful insights into physical performance and overall physiological status, hence offering considerable promise for diverse sport, military, and biomedical applications,\" say the scientists. Future research will further correlate sweat lactate levels with fitness, performance and blood lactate levels, Wang added.

Sixteen endurance-trained cyclists were assigned randomly to a control (CON) group, who consumed their habitual diet (30% \u00b1 8% mJ fat), or a HFD group, who consumed a high-fat isocaloric diet (69% \u00b1 1% mJ fat). At 5-day intervals, the subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); on the next day, they performed a 2.5-hour constant-load ride at 70% peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), followed by a simulated 40-km cycling time-trial while ingesting a 10% 14C-glucose + 3.44% medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) emulsion at a rate of 600 mL\/h. In the OGTT, plasma glucose concentrations at 30 minutes increased significantly after 5 days of the HFD and remained elevated at days 10 and 15 versus the levels measured prior to the HFD (P < .05). The activity of carnitine acyltransferase (CAT) in biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle also increased from 0.45 to 0.54 \u03bcmol\/g\/min over days 0 to 10 of the HFD (P < .01) without any change in citrate synthase (CS) or 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (3-HAD) activities. Changes in glucose tolerance and CAT activity were associated with a shift from carbohydrate (CHO) to fat oxidation during exercise (P < .001), which occurred within 5 to 10 days of the HFD. During the constant-load ride, the calculated oxidation of muscle glycogen was reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 g\/min (P < .001) after 15 days of the HFD. Ingestion of a HFD for as little as 5 to 10 days significantly altered substrate utilization during submaximal exercise but did not attenuate the 40-km time-trial performance.     Changes in the Energy Cost of Running during a 24-h Treadmill Exercise Gimenez, Philippe1; Kerherv\u00e9, Hugo2; Messonnier, Laurent A.3; F\u00e9asson, L\u00e9onard1,4; Millet, Guillaume Y.1     Collapse BoxAbstract Purpose: Although fatigue generally increases the energy cost of running (Cr), the changes of Cr and associated variables during an ultramarathon are not known. This study aimed to determine the changes of metabolic and cardiovascular adjustments during an ultraendurance exercise.     Methods: Twelve healthy males ran 24 h on a motorized treadmill (24TR). Overall oxygen consumption (V\u02d9O2 mL\u00b7min\u22121\u00b7kg\u22121), net energy cost (Cr J\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7m\u22121), and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were determined before, every 2 h, and after the 24TR at 8 km\u00b7h\u22121. Running speed and heart rate (HR) were continuously measured during the 24TR.     Results: V\u02d9O2 increased (+7.6%, P < 0.001) during the 24TR, principally in the first 8 h of exercise. The RER mirrored changes in V\u02d9O2, that is, decreased significantly until the eighth hour and remained constant thereafter. As a consequence of RER decrease, the increased Cr was markedly attenuated but was still significantly higher at the 8th and 12th hour compared with pre-24TR. Speed was constant over the first 6 h then significantly decreased during the 24TR. HR increased until the sixth hour (i.e., HR drift), then decreased until post-24TR. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation (R = 0.75, P < 0.01) was observed between the velocity sustained during the 24TR (expressed in percentage of the velocity attained at V\u02d9O2max: %VV\u02d9O2max) and the pre- to postchanges in Cr.     Conclusions: The present study characterized accurately the changes of energy cost and substrate use during an extreme run, showing a plateau after 8 h of exercise. It is also concluded that the participants who maintained the highest %VV\u02d9O2max were also those having most deteriorated their Cr over the 24TR, supporting the notion of a trade-off between running speed (relative to VV\u02d9O2max) and Cr.

Since 2000 he has choreographed and produced 15 artistic projects, which were presented to international audiences from Moscow to New York. Goran is the recipient of several prestigious awards, among them also the 2004 UNESCO Aschberg Award (Montreal). He is the artistic and managing director of Fi\u010do Balet since its establishment in 2000.     In 2003 Goran launched, together with several partners, Gibanica (Moving Cake), Biennial of Slovenian Contemporary Dance Art, the first Slovenian dance platform to showcase and promote Slovenian contemporary dance. In response to the inefficient systems for creating and producing contemporary dance in Ljubljana, Goran proposed and realised the initiative for a new and much needed rehearsal space at Kino \u0160i\u0161ka and also acted as its manager until 2009, when the spaces were renovated in cooperation with Asociacija, Association of Arts and Culture NGOs and Freelancers, and the Municipality of Ljubljana and renamed Kino \u0160i\u0161ka Centre for Urban Culture. In 2005 he instigated an international education-research project NOMAD Dance Academy with partners from six countries in the region to fill the lack of opportunities for research and education in contemporary dance. He was also involved in the constitution of the Centre of Contemporary Dance Art and the Slovenian Contemporary Dance Network. As curator he worked on numerous projects, among them the project of European dance houses Modul-dance, the international laboratory TryAngel and international festivals CoFestival and at\u0160i\u0161ka!.     Goran has passed on his knowledge and understanding of dance to over 1.000 individuals and groups (dancers, actors, choreographers, students, professors, artists, producers, pedagogues, directors, managers, software designers \u2026) in 23 countries across the world through dance classes, workshops, research projects, artistic creations, coaching and mentoring.     Goran\u2019s teaching method is a synthesis of dance techniques and tools that he has been experimenting with and developing over the past 20 years. They range from classical ballet to martial arts, from modern and contemporary dance to Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Kundalini and dynamic meditations, from contact to theatre improvisation, underpinned by his vast experience as a maker and co-maker in the area of performing arts. Goran\u2019s teaching is based on improvisation, presence, group awareness and dynamics and, especially, on artistic creativity.     Besides teaching regularly in Ljubljana, Goran has held workshops and training in the following countries: Austria, Germany, Belgium, Georgia, Azerbaijan, USA, Ukraine, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Poland, Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Slovenia\u2026 "

With continued use, you agree to the use of cookies.     SOL\u010cAVA HIKING AND CYCLING FESTIVAL     Company     Logarska dolina d.o.o. is a non-profit private company that brings together partners that are mostly local landowners. Ever since its establishment, it has invested all of the funds it obtains in protecting nature, managing infrastructure and preparing and implementing programmes for the sustainable development of the park and the region surrounding it.     In 1987, the Municipality of Mozirje established the Logar Valley Landscape Park, but this did not solve the problems in relation to tourism, as the municipal ordinance did not provide for the funding of the operation of the park. In 1992, the locals therefore reached an agreement on development goals, established the company and obtained a management concession from the governing municipality. The development of the park, which has a significant effect on the wider area, is based on a balance between ecological, social and economic content and the participation of the competent organisations.     The company works closely with numerous organisations and individuals engaged in the sustainable development of similar regions. The Park is a member of the Alpine Network of Protected Areas. Logarska d.o.o. is one of the petitioners for the establishment of a regional park with the neighbouring municipalities in the Kamnik-Savinja Alps. In 2005, it received the highest award from CIPRA International in the area of Alpine protected areas for its innovative management of a protected area and its successful operation. "

The reason for this is because the forend is wider and the rear stock has a cut out which makes it better to use when shooting in a prone position.     The SpeedLock 2.0 system makes it easy to adjust the length of pull and cheek piece of the stock. The grip also has an angle of six percent, so the hand is in a natural and steady position.

Record is a part of a journal     ISSN:     Secondary language     Undetermined     Title:     Archive in the Arts     The article outlines the place of the idea of archive on the conceptual map of art practices. The concept of archive has gained a lot of momentum in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, not merely as a functional tool for preserving cultural heritage but as a central issue regarding cultural memory and the understanding of, as well as dealing with, the reality. The first part of the article begins by pointing to the archaeological approach in the humanities, in the works by Michel Foucault. Next the theory of new media object by Lev Manovich is presented, which integrates the database of multimedia materials and a multiplicity, i. e. an archive, of interfaces. The technical level and the cultural level of the computer-based communication are considered. Benjamin H. D. Buchloh has introduced a distinction in the understanding of avant-garde art practices between the aesthetics of montage\/ collage and the aesthetics of archive, which does not allow for the elements presented together to create a new unified whole. The inventors of the photomontage already after 1925 turn towards a didactical curation of photographic collections thereby rejecting the effects of the shock stemming from a surprising juxtaposition. The German artists after the 2nd World War connect the archival art to the traumatic memory. The next step is the institutional critique (of the modern museum) of Marcel Broodthaers, which considers the archive as the law of what can be said (Foucault), considering the current discourses and dispositifs. Damien Hirst is also presented from the institutional-critique point of view. The nanotechnology and the contemporary digitized reality are both a sort of discursive realities, that can be construed as a dispersion of regularities that have no natural hierarchical order \u2013 the nanotechnology homogenizes the world of materials on the atomic scale, dispensing with the traditional divisions of the material world, such as organic, inorganic etc. The mediatisation of architecture and environment transforms the world into a surface of statements: the increasingly manipulated reality becomes itself a window into the cultural archive, according to Peter Weibel. The photographic reflections and their theorization by Allan Sekula are used to point to the duality of realism and nominalism in philosophy: realism of general terms is needed, unless the world disintegrates into fragmentariness of particular cases. Starting from photographs, criminology attempts to create the criminal type, whereas criminalistics nominalistically chases this particular criminal body. Lev Manovich\u2019s synthetic realism is presented as an uneven simulation of reality in new media, which makes it archive-like, a constellation of signs that represent (photo)realism. The second part of the article explains in detail Walter Benjamin\u2019s theory of the German counter-reformation Trauerspiel (mourning play) from his The Origin of German Tragic Drama (1928), and aligns it with his theory of the technical media, e.g. from his famous paper The Work Art in the Age of Technical Reproduction. The reality and the artwork are both archive-like, but not in an empirical way, starting from experience, but and archive of ruins, filed sign vehicles that have lost all their meanings. Everything is corpse-like, which ominously points towards the impending holocaust. In the conclusion of the second part of the article a moment from a digital video by Slovene video artist Sre\u010do Dragan, who together with Nu\u0161a Dragan is the author of the first video in former Yugoslavia in 1969, is analysed. Dragan\u2019s Rotas Axis Mundi (1995\/96) video deals with the war in Bosnia in a way that does not betray the victims by exploiting their suffering by making it representable, even spectacular, and integrating it into the cultural industry (as criticized by the Frankfurt School).

Ali se jo bo\u0161 do onemoglosti trudila zapeti ali pa pustila nakit doma, ker tako ali tako ve\u0161, da v boju z zapestnico preprosto nikoli ne zmaga\u0161. Hej, glavo pokonci in zapestnico na roke! Zate smo zbrskali super trik, s katerim bo\u0161 enostavno zapela tudi najbolj drobne zapestnice in to ekspresno hitro \u2013 \u010disto vsaki\u010d!     Kaj potrebuje\u0161: medicinski lepilni trak in \u0161karje.     Postopek: Odre\u017ei majhen kos traku. Na en konec zapestnice, kak\u0161en centimeter pred zaklju\u010dkom, prilepi trak in ga z zapestnico pri\u010dvrsti na ko\u017eo.

      "text":" In case of symptoms suspected of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, cold, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting), make an appointment over the phone and do not enter community health centre unannounced.     IMPORTANT NOTICE     Dear patients,     With the phasing-out of measures at the national level and the order of the Ministry of Health on temporary measures in the field of health care in view of containment and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, Community Health Centre Ljubljana has gradually begun increasing the scope of available health care services. Given the current epidemiological situation, from the point of view of safety of patients and medical staff alike, caution is still required, as well as the use of personal protective equipment and taking all the measures necessary to prevent corona virus infection.     Check-up with a GP and all other activities at the Community Health Centre Ljubljana are only possible after a prior appointment and consultation with the medical staff (over the phone or via e-mail). Your GP will assess your medical condition and reach a professional decision about any necessary treatment. The assessment can be made via e-mail, over the phone, or directly through a medical check-up.     If you have symptoms and show signs of COVID-19, your GP will refer you over the phone for swab testing and\/or a check-up at a COVID clinic, therefore never visit the health centre unannounced.     In the event of a life-threatening condition, call 112 immediately.     For your scheduled appointment, please arrive at the health centre no more than 5 minutes before the appointment.     At the entrance to the health centre, disinfect your hands and put on a surgical mask; wear the mask at all times for the duration of your visit.     Please observe a personal safety distance of at least 1.5 metres in all areas of the health centre.     On the day before your check-up, you should receive a call from the medical staff, who will check your medical and epidemiological condition by means of a questionnaire. It is advisable to print out and fill in the Questionnaire for the assessment of medical condition before treatment in the outpatient clinic at home, and bring it with you for your scheduled appointment.     Only healthy persons should come for a check-up. If a person falls ill, we kindly ask them to inform us of the fact and so waive their appointment time to somebody else.     ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES (PRESCRIPTIONS, SICK LEAVE ...)     All administrative services, such as issuing prescriptions for chronic therapy, referrals for check-ups, orders for medical devices, at the discretion of the GP possibly also sick leave, are performed remotely over the phone or, most preferably, by e-mail. When contacting us via e-mail, please state your name and surname, date of birth, Health Insurance Card number and the telephone number where you can be reached.     ENTERING THE HEALTH CENTRE     With the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the population, entering the Community Health Centre Ljubljana is limited and runs exclusively through the triage point. We ask all patients entering the health centre to provide the nurse with ACCURATE and TRUE information about their health condition, possible visits to high-risk areas and any close contact with infected persons. Providing untrue information means endangering one\u2019s own health and everyone else\u2019s.     WEEKENDS, PUBLIC HOLIDAYS AND NIGHT-TIME     On weekends, public holidays and at night, the paediatric emergency first-aid service (PNMP) and adult emergency first-aid service (SNMP) run in an unchanged manner. In case of symptoms suspected of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, cold, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting), make an appointment over the phone and do not visit the emergency service unannounced.     Before seeking emergency medical help, consider whether a check-up is necessary or whether you can wait for the workday to call your personal or a substitute practitioner.     Ustna higiena     Samopla\u010dni\u0161ka ambulanta za ustno higieno v Zdravstvenem domu Ljubljana deluje \u017ee od leta 2009. Lahko re\u010demo, da se pona\u0161amo tako s kakovostjo in znanjem, kot s konkuren\u010dnimi cenami ter smo glede na kakovost \u0161e vedno med cenej\u0161imi.     Profesionalno odstranjevanje zobnih oblog je najbolj\u0161a preventiva pred zobno gnilobo in parodontalno boleznijo. Z osebno ustno higieno o\u010distimo le 70 % zobnih povr\u0161in v ustni votlini, zato je priporo\u010dljivo, da enkrat do dvakrat letno obi\u0161\u010dite ustnega higienika, ki vam bo profesionalno o\u010distil kriti\u010dna mesta, kjer so se nabrale zobne obloge, spoliral zobe in podu\u010dil o pravilni tehniki ustne higiene.     Parodontalna bolezen ali vnetje obzobnih tkiv je stanje, ko se iz nezdravljenega akutnega (za\u010detnega) vnetja dlesni med zobom in dlesnijo pojavijo patolo\u0161ko pove\u010dani obzobni \u017eepi, tudi slab zadah, zobje lahko postanejo navidezno dalj\u0161i (zaradi umikanja dlesni), ob\u010dutljivi ali se za\u010dnejo majati in posledi\u010dno izpadejo.     Z vzpostavitvijo pravilne ustne higiene in profesionalno, mehani\u010dno odstranitvijo plaka, zobnega kamna ter ostalih mehanskih ovir, ki omogo\u010dajo zadr\u017eevanje zobnih oblog, se gingivitis (za\u010detno, akutno vnetje dlesni) popolnoma pozdravi in ne pu\u0161\u010da trajnih posledic na obzobnih tkivih.     Namen za\u010detnega zdravljenja parodontalne bolezni je zmanj\u0161ati koli\u010dino bakterij, katere se nahajajo v zobnih oblogah, ki so glavni vzrok za nastanek parodontalne bolezni, in s tem zmanj\u0161ati vnetje dlesni. S pomo\u010djo ultrazvo\u010dnih in\u0161trumentov odstranimo plak in trde zobne obloge s povr\u0161ine zoba nad dlesnijo in iz obzobnih \u017eepov. Z ro\u010dnimi in\u0161trumenti pa povr\u0161ine korenin zlu\u0161\u010dimo in zagladimo. Isto\u010dasno odstranimo vse mehanske ovire, ki so lahko vzrok za zadr\u017eevanje zobnih oblog. Paciente natan\u010dno pou\u010dimo o pravilnih tehnikah \u010di\u0161\u010denja zob in tekom zdravljenja tudi spremljamo njihovo pravilno izvajanje.     Dva do tri mesece po opravljenem za\u010detnem zdravljenju se opravi kontrolni pregled. \u010ce kljub predhodnim postopkom ne pride do bistvenega izbolj\u0161anja, sledi druga, kirur\u0161ka faza zdravljenja, ki jo nadaljuje specialist parodontolog. Pred obiskom parodontologa se mora pacient zglasiti pri svojem osebnem zobozdravniku, ker se morata zobozdravnik in parodontolog glede nadaljevanja zdravljenja uskladiti in dogovoriti. Pacienti z nezadostno in nepravilno ustno higieno niso primerni za kirur\u0161ki poseg.     Izvajajo:     ZDL \u2013 Be\u017eigrad: Emira Be\u0107irbegovi\u0107, ustni hig.

      "text":" The Kingdom of Tonga and its people     Slovenians like to complain when a postcard from Rome to Ljubljana first goes through Bratislava. How in the world can postmen mistake our little country below Triglav for Slovakia? Maybe it will provide some relief to know that we\u2019re not the only nation with this problem and that we should in fact be happy that the post intended for us remains on the same continent. Somewhere in the middle of the Pacific, between the Cook Islands and Fiji, there is a small kingdom that not many people have heard about. So it often happens that a letter sent by a lady in Los Angeles to her parents in Tonga first travels to the other side of the world, to African Togo.     The Kingdom of Tonga is the only South Pacific country that has never been colonised and it shows. It has remained pristinely Polynesian, which is interesting for tourists (admittedly few), and an endless source of frustration for those who move there and try to create something. Bureaucracy is extremely inefficient, public services are terrible and entrepreneurialism is truly rare. It seems to me that they mostly lack vision, which is why their decisions are often very short-sighted.     Of all the people from the Pacific region I\u2019ve met so far, Tongans are the most reserved. They\u2019re very kind, like all Polynesians, but it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re not used to being in contact with people different from them. It\u2019s very hard to form deeper friendship bonds with them. After initial failed attempts I have accepted the fact that they see us as \u201cpalangi\u201d (white people) from another planet and just want to keep a safe distance.     Tonga also differs from its neighbours in terms of economy. There is very little money on these islands. People grow taro and cassava, and fish, and for big holidays they slaughter one of the many pigs who roam freely around gardens and beaches.     The main source of income are in fact the Tongans who have emigrated and work in New Zealand or Australia and regularly send money to their families. For all public projects, from building schools and hospitals to help in natural disasters, Tonga is dependent on other countries.     Despite economic problems, the Tongans are happy people. They like celebrations (and they make a special effort when the king comes to visit), they socialise a lot and smile.     Only on Sundays is everything quiet. Tongans are very religious and the Lord\u2019s day is\u2014also by law\u2014intended only for rest. All types of work are strictly forbidden, including sports activities. An acquaintance even had problems because he was caught on a bicycle on a Sunday! Some people complain (for example the owners of diving centres, who lose one day\u2019s worth of profit), but I in fact quite like being forced to do nothing one day a week.     Tonga is an ideal destination for those who need a break because there's not much to do but lie on the beach. But, as a matter of fact, it\u2019s best to visit it with a sailboat, either your own or a charter one. By far the most beautiful face of Tonga are its numerous uninhabited dreamy islands that we can have just to ourselves for a day or two.     Jasna Tuta     I have always had a connection to the sea. Born in the coastal village of Sistiana (near Trieste) in northern Italy, my earliest memories are of watching the heavy waves slam ashore when the local winds were blowing hard. As a teenager, the sailing club became my focus \u2013 not just for my love of water sports, but also for the handsome boys that sailed there. I went on to become an Optimist instructor for the club by summer and a junior school teacher by winter. However, ten years of focusing on the needs of children dampened my maternal instincts somewhat and I felt the need to travel. The sea was the obvious way to go\u2026 "

Winston Smith, s bradou p\u00f8itisknutou k hrudi, aby unikl protivn\u00e9mu v\u00ectru, rychle proklouzl sklen\u00ecn\u00fdmi dve\u00f8mi v\u00ec\u00be\u00e1ku na S\u00eddli\u00b9ti v\u00edt\u00eczstv\u00ed, ne v\u00b9ak dost rychle, aby zabr\u00e1nil zv\u00ed\u00f8en\u00e9mu p\u00edsku a prachu vniknout dovnit\u00f8.     <Oen.1.1.1.2> Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.     <Oen.1.1.2.1>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats.     <Ocs.1.1.2.2>Na st\u00ecn\u00ec na jednom konci \u00fazk\u00e9ho prostoru byl p\u00f8ip\u00edchnut barevn\u00fd plak\u00e1t, kter\u00fd se svou velikost\u00ed dovnit\u00f8 nehodil.     <Oen.1.1.2.2>At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.     <Ocs.1.1.2.3>Byla na

<Oen.1.1.2.3>It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.     <Ocs.1.1.2.4> Winston zam\u00ed\u00f8il ke schod\u00f9m.     <Oen.1.1.2.4> Winston made for the stairs.     <Ocs.1.1.2.5>Nem\u00eclo smysl zkou\u00b9et v\u00fdtah.     <Oen.1.1.2.5>It was no use trying the lift.

<Ocs.1.1.2.7>Byt byl v sedm\u00e9m pat\u00f8e.     <Oen.1.1.2.7>It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.     <Ocs.1.1.2.8> Winston, kter\u00e9mu bylo dev\u00ectat\u00f8icet a

Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way.     <Ocs.1.1.2.9>Na ka\u00bed\u00e9m poschod\u00ed naproti v\u00fdtahov\u00fdm dve\u00f8\u00edm na n\u00echo se zdi z\u00edrala obrovsk\u00e1 tv\u00e1\u00f8 z plak\u00e1t\u00f9.     <Oen.1.1.2.9>On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall.     <Ocs.1.1.2.10>Byl to jeden z t\u00ecch obraz\u00f9, kter\u00e9 jsou ud\u00ecl\u00e1ny tak d\u00f9mysln\u00ec, \u00bee v\u00e1s o\u00e8i sleduj\u00ed, kam se

pod obrazem.     <Oen.1.1.2.11>\" Big Brother is watching you\", the caption beneath it ran.     <Oen.1.1.3.1>Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron.     <Ocs.1.1.3.2>Hlas vych\u00e1zel z obd\u00e9ln\u00edkov\u00e9 desky, jak\u00e9hosi matn\u00e9ho zrcadla, je\u00be bylo sou\u00e8\u00e1st\u00ed povrchu st\u00ecny po prav\u00e9 stran\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.3.2>The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall.     <Ocs.1.1.3.3> Winston oto\u00e8il knofl\u00edkem a hlas se trochu zti\u00b9il, ale slov\u00f9m bylo st\u00e1le je\u00b9t\u00ec rozum\u00ect.     <Oen.1.1.3.3> Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable.     <Ocs.1.1.3.4>P\u00f8\u00edstroj (ve skute\u00e8nosti televizn\u00ed obrazovka) se dal ztlumit, ale nebylo mo\u00ben\u00e9 ho \u00fapln\u00ec vypnout.     <Oen.1.1.3.4>The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.     <Oen.1.1.3.5>He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the Party.     <Ocs.1.1.3.6>Vlasy m\u00ecl velmi sv\u00ectl\u00e9, tv\u00e1\u00f8 p\u00f8irozen\u00ec rum\u00ecnou,

sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.     <Ocs.1.1.4.1>Sv\u00ect venku vypadal i p\u00f8es zav\u00f8en\u00e9 okno

<Oen.1.1.4.2>Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere.     <Ocs.1.1.4.3>Tv\u00e1\u00f8 s \u00e8ern\u00fdm kn\u00edrem shl\u00ed\u00beela ze v\u00b9ech n\u00e1ro\u00be\u00ed, kam oko dohl\u00e9dlo.

<Oen.1.1.4.5>\" Big Brother is watching you,\" the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own.     <Ocs.1.1.4.6>Dole na ulici se ve v\u00ectru k\u00f8e\u00e8ovit\u00ec

streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word \" Ingsoc\".     <Ocs.1.1.4.7>Daleko odtud se snesl mezi st\u00f8echy vrtuln\u00edk, chvilku se vzn\u00e1\u00b9el jako moucha masa\u00f8ka a obloukem zase odlet\u00ecl.     <Oen.1.1.4.7>In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight.     <Ocs.1.1.4.8>Byla to policejn\u00ed hl\u00eddka, co strk\u00e1 lidem nos do oken.     <Oen.1.1.4.8>It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows.     <Ocs.1.1.4.9>Ale hl\u00eddky nebyly d\u00f9le\u00beit\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.4.9>The patrols did not matter, however.     <Ocs.1.1.4.10>D\u00f9le\u00beit\u00e1 byla

pig-iron and the overfulfillment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan.     <Ocs.1.1.5.2>Obrazovka sou\u00e8asn\u00ec p\u00f8ij\u00edmala a vys\u00edlala.     <Oen.1.1.5.2>The telescreen received and

whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard.     <Ocs.1.1.5.4>Samoz\u00f8ejm\u00ec, \u00e8lov\u00eck si nikdy nebyl jist, zda ho v dan\u00e9m okam\u00beiku sleduj\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.5.4>There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being

<Oen.1.1.5.5>How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork.     <Oen.1.1.5.6>It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time.     <Ocs.1.1.5.7>A rozhodn\u00ec mohli zapnout va\u00b9e za\u00f8\u00edzen\u00ed, kdy se jim cht\u00eclo.     <Oen.1.1.5.7>But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to.     <Ocs.1.1.5.8>\u00c8lov\u00eck musel \u00be\u00edt -- a \u00beil, ze zvyku, kter\u00fd se stal pudov\u00fdm, -- v p\u00f8edpokladu, \u00bee ka\u00bed\u00fd zvuk, kter\u00fd vyd\u00e1, je zaslechnut, a ka\u00bed\u00fd pohyb, pokud nen\u00ed tma, zaznamen\u00e1n.     <Oen.1.1.5.8>You had to live -- did live, from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.     <Oen.1.1.6.1> Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen.     <Ocs.1.1.6.2>To bylo bezpe\u00e8n\u00ecj\u00b9\u00ed; a\u00e8koli, jak dob\u00f8e v\u00ecd\u00ecl, i z\u00e1da mohou ledacos prozradit.     <Oen.1.1.6.2>It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing.     <Ocs.1.1.6.3>Kilometr odtud se ty\u00e8ila

  <Oen.1.1.6.5>He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this.     <Ocs.1.1.6.6>Byla tu odjak\u00beiva tahle vyhl\u00eddka na

<Ocs.1.1.6.7>Byly tu odjak\u00beiva trosky po bombardov\u00e1n\u00ed, nad nimi\u00be ve vzduchu v\u00ed\u00f8\u00ed prach z om\u00edtky, i vrby skl\u00e1n\u00ecj\u00edc\u00ed se nad hromadami

<Ocs.1.1.7.1> Ministerstvo pravdy, v newspeaku* Pramini se d\u00ecsiv\u00ec li\u00b9ilo od v\u00b9ech ostatn\u00edch objekt\u00f9 v dohledu.     <Oen.1.1.7.1> Ministry of Truth, -- Minitrue, in

between which the entire apparatus of government was divided.<Oen.1.1.9.5>The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts.     <Oen.1.1.10.1>The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one.     <Ocs.1.1.10.2>Nem\u00eclo v\u00f9bec okna.     <Oen.1.1.10.2>There were no windows in it at all.     <Ocs.1.1.10.3> Winston nikdy nebyl v

<Ocs.1.1.10.4>Bylo to m\u00edsto, kam se nedalo vstoupit jinak ne\u00be v ofici\u00e1ln\u00ed z\u00e1le\u00beitosti, a to pouze tak, \u00bee \u00e8lov\u00eck musel proniknout z\u00e1tarasy z

<Oen.1.1.10.5>Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.     <Ocs.1.1.11.1> Winston se r\u00e1zn\u00ec oto\u00e8il.     <Oen.1.1.11.1> Winston turned round abruptly.     <Ocs.1.1.11.2>Vyladil rysy v obli\u00e8eji do v\u00fdrazu pokojn\u00e9ho optimismu, kter\u00fd bylo radno nasadit, kdy\u00be byl

and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast.     <Ocs.1.1.11.6>Vzal z poli\u00e8ky l\u00e1hev

<Oen.1.1.11.6>It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice spirit.     <Ocs.1.1.11.8> Winston si nalil t\u00e9m\u00ec\u00f8 pln\u00fd \u00b9\u00e1lek, dodal si odvahy a obr\u00e1til to do sebe nar\u00e1z jako medic\u00ednu.     <Oen.1.1.11.7> Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.     <Ocs.1.1.12.1>Tv\u00e1\u00f8 mu okam\u00beit\u00ec zrudla a z o\u00e8\u00ed mu vytryskly slzy.     <Oen.1.1.12.1>Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes.     <Ocs.1.1.12.2>To svinstvo

<Oen.1.1.12.2>The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club.     <Ocs.1.1.12.3>V

his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful.     <Ocs.1.1.12.4>Vzal si cigaretu ze zma\u00e8kan\u00e9ho bal\u00ed\u00e8ku s n\u00e1pisem \" Cigarety v\u00edt\u00eczstv\u00ed\", ale

upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor.     <Ocs.1.1.12.5>S dal\u00b9\u00ed cigaretou u\u00be pochodil l\u00e9pe.     <Oen.1.1.12.5>With the next he was more successful.     <Ocs.1.1.12.6>Vr\u00e1til se do ob\u00fdvac\u00edho pokoje a sedl si ke stolu, kter\u00fd st\u00e1l vlevo od obrazovky.     <Oen.1.1.12.6>He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen.     <Oen.1.1.12.7>From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover.     <Ocs.1.1.13.1>Z nezn\u00e1m\u00e9ho d\u00f9vodu byla obrazovka v ob\u00fdvac\u00edm pokoji um\u00edst\u00ecna neobvykle.     <Oen.1.1.13.1>For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an

Winston nyn\u00ed sed\u00ecl v m\u00eclk\u00e9m v\u00fdklenku t\u00e9to st\u00ecny, kde asi p\u00f9vodn\u00ec m\u00ecly b\u00fdt vestav\u00ecny police na knihy.     <Oen.1.1.13.3>To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves.     <Ocs.1.1.13.4>Kdy\u00be Winston sed\u00ecl v koutku a dr\u00beel se hodn\u00ec vzadu, byl mimo zorn\u00e9 pole obrazovky.     <Oen.1.1.13.4>By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went.     <Ocs.1.1.13.5>Mohlo ho samoz\u00f8ejm\u00ec b\u00fdt sly\u00b9et, ale pokud z\u00f9st\u00e1val ve sv\u00e9 nyn\u00ecj\u00b9\u00ed pozici, nemohlo ho b\u00fdt

was now about to do.     <Ocs.1.1.14.1>Ale z\u00e8\u00e1sti ho k tomu p\u00f8ivedl i se\u00b9it, kter\u00fd pr\u00e1v\u00ec vylovil ze z\u00e1suvky.     <Oen.1.1.14.1>But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer.     <Ocs.1.1.14.2>Byl to neoby\u00e8ejn\u00ec kr\u00e1sn\u00fd se\u00b9it.     <Oen.1.1.14.2>It was a peculiarly beautiful book.

<Oen.1.1.14.3>Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past.     <Ocs.1.1.14.4>Odhadoval v\u00b9ak, \u00bee se\u00b9it byl je\u00b9t\u00ec mnohem star\u00b9\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.14.4>He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that.     <Ocs.1.1.14.5> Winston ho zahl\u00e9dl ve v\u00fdkladu zatuchl\u00e9ho kr\u00e1mku se staro\u00beitnostmi na perif\u00e9rii (ale kter\u00e1 \u00e8tvr\u00bb to byla, si nepamatoval) a hned se ho zmocnila nep\u00f8ekonateln\u00e1 touha vlastnit ho.     <Oen.1.1.14.5>He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an

<Ocs.1.1.14.10>Vlastnit takov\u00fd se\u00b9it bylo samo o sob\u00ec kompromituj\u00edc\u00ed, i kdyby v n\u00ecm nebylo naps\u00e1no nic.     <Oen.1.1.14.10>Even with nothing written in it, it was a

archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on

his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.     <Ocs.1.1.18.1>Pro koho vlastn\u00ec

her hips.     <Ocs.1.1.24.8> Winstonovi se od prvn\u00edho okam\u00beiku nel\u00edbila.     <Oen.1.1.24.8> Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her.     <Ocs.1.1.24.9>V\u00ecd\u00ecl pro\u00e8.     <Oen.1.1.24.9>He knew the reason.     <Ocs.1.1.24.10>Proto\u00bee kolem sebe vytv\u00e1\u00f8ela atmosf\u00e9ru hokejov\u00e9ho h\u00f8i\u00b9t\u00ec,

<Oen.1.1.24.11>He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones.     <Oen.1.1.24.12>It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of

<Ocs.1.1.24.14>Jednou, kdy\u00be kolem sebe proch\u00e1zeli na chodb\u00ec, vrhla na n\u00echo \u00fakosem ostr\u00fd pohled, kter\u00fd ho na okam\u00beik naplnil temnou hr\u00f9zou.     <Oen.1.1.24.14>Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror.     <Oen.1.1.24.15>The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police.     <Ocs.1.1.24.16>To v\u00b9ak po pravd\u00ec \u00f8e\u00e8eno bylo velmi

an Inner Party member approaching.     <Ocs.1.1.25.3> O'Brien byl rozlo\u00beit\u00fd, siln\u00fd mu\u00be s pevnou \u00b9\u00edj\u00ed a drsnou, v\u00fdraznou, krutou tv\u00e1\u00f8\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.25.3> O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face.     <Oen.1.1.25.4>In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner.     <Ocs.1.1.25.5>Zvl\u00e1\u00b9tn\u00edm zp\u00f9sobem si rovnal br\u00fdle na nose, co\u00be bylo neoby\u00e8ejn\u00ec odzbrojuj\u00edc\u00ed gesto a v nedefinovateln\u00e9m smyslu u\u00b9lechtil\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.25.5>He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming -- in some indefinable way, curiously civilized.     <Ocs.1.1.25.6>Bylo to gesto, kter\u00e9 by mohlo vyvolat p\u00f8edstavu \u00b9lechtice z osmn\u00e1ct\u00e9ho stolet\u00ed nab\u00edzej\u00edc\u00edho tabat\u00ecrku se \u00b9\u00f2upav\u00fdm tab\u00e1kem, kdyby ov\u00b9em byl je\u00b9t\u00ec n\u00eckdo schopen takov\u00fdch p\u00f8edstav.     <Oen.1.1.25.6>It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox.     <Ocs.1.1.25.7> Winston O'Briena vid\u00ecl za posledn\u00edch deset let snad desetkr\u00e1t.     <Oen.1.1.25.7> Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years.     <Ocs.1.1.25.8>Cosi ho k n\u00ecmu siln\u00ec p\u00f8itahovalo, a nebyl to jen kontrast mezi O'Brienov\u00fdm uhlazen\u00fdm chov\u00e1n\u00edm a fyzick\u00fdm vzez\u00f8en\u00edm z\u00e1pasn\u00edka.     <Oen.1.1.25.8>He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's physique.     <Ocs.1.1.25.9>Mnohem v\u00edc tu p\u00f9sobila tajn\u00e1 v\u00edra -- anebo snad ne v\u00edra, ale sp\u00ed\u00b9 nad\u00ecje, \u00bee O'Brienova politick\u00e1 pravov\u00ecrnost nen\u00ed bez kazu.     <Oen.1.1.25.9>Much more it was because of a secretly held belief -- or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope -- that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect.     <Ocs.1.1.25.10>Cosi v jeho tv\u00e1\u00f8i to nepopirateln\u00ec nazna\u00e8ovalo.     <Oen.1.1.25.10>Something in his face suggested it irresistibly.     <Ocs.1.1.25.11>Mo\u00ben\u00e1 v\u00b9ak nem\u00ecl ve tv\u00e1\u00f8i veps\u00e1nu neortodoxnost, ale prost\u00ec inteligenci.     <Oen.1.1.25.11>And again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence.     <Ocs.1.1.25.12>V ka\u00bed\u00e9m p\u00f8\u00edpad\u00ec vypadal jako n\u00eckdo, s k\u00fdm by se dalo hovo\u00f8it, kdyby s n\u00edm \u00e8lov\u00eck mohl z\u00f9stat o samot\u00ec p\u00f8i vypnut\u00e9 obrazovce.     <Oen.1.1.25.12>But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone.     <Ocs.1.1.25.13> Winston v\u00b9ak nikdy nevyvinul nejmen\u00b9\u00ed \u00fasil\u00ed, aby si svou domn\u00ecnku ov\u00ec\u00f8il: vlastn\u00ec to ani ne\u00b9lo.     <Oen.1.1.25.13> Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so.     <Ocs.1.1.25.14>V tu chv\u00edli pohl\u00e9dl O'Brien na svoje n\u00e1ramkov\u00e9 hodinky; zjistil, \u00bee z\u00f9stane v Odd\u00eclen\u00ed z\u00e1znam\u00f9, dokud Dv\u00ec minuty nen\u00e1visti neskon\u00e8\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.25.14>At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over.     <Ocs.1.1.25.15>Usedl na \u00beidli v t\u00e9\u00bee \u00f8ad\u00ec jako Winston, o n\u00eckolik m\u00edst d\u00e1l.     <Oen.1.1.25.15>He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.     <Ocs.1.1.25.16>Mezi nimi sed\u00ecla mal\u00e1 \u00beena s p\u00edskov\u00fdmi vlasy, kter\u00e1 pracovala v k\u00f3ji vedle Winstona.     <Oen.1.1.25.16>A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them.     <Ocs.1.1.25.17>D\u00edvka s tmav\u00fdmi vlasy sed\u00ecla hned za nimi.     <Oen.1.1.25.17>The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.     <Ocs.1.1.26.1>V p\u00f8\u00ed\u00b9t\u00edm okam\u00beiku se z velk\u00e9 obrazovky na konci m\u00edstnosti vyvalila ohavn\u00e1 sk\u00f8\u00edpav\u00e1 \u00f8e\u00e8, jakoby vych\u00e1zej\u00edc\u00ed z obludn\u00e9ho, nenamazan\u00e9ho stroje.     <Oen.1.1.26.1>The next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room.     <Ocs.1.1.26.2>Zvuky, p\u00f8i nich\u00be \u00e8lov\u00ecku cvakaly zuby a je\u00beily se vlasy na hlav\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.26.2>It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one's neck.     <Ocs.1.1.26.3>Za\u00e8ala Nen\u00e1vist.     <Oen.1.1.26.3>The Hate had started.     <Ocs.1.1.27.1>Jako oby\u00e8ejn\u00ec se na obrazovce objevila tv\u00e1\u00f8 Emanuela Goldsteina, Nep\u00f8\u00edtele lidu.     <Oen.1.1.27.1>As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen.     <Ocs.1.1.27.2>Tu a tam se mezi poslucha\u00e8i ozval sykot.     <Oen.1.1.27.2>There were hisses here and there among the audience.     <Ocs.1.1.27.3>Drobn\u00e1 \u00beena s p\u00edskov\u00fdmi vlasy ze sebe vydala sk\u00f8ek, v n\u00ecm\u00be se m\u00edsil strach a odpor.     <Oen.1.1.27.3>The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust.     <Ocs.1.1.27.4> Goldstein byl reneg\u00e1t a odpadl\u00edk, kter\u00fd kdysi d\u00e1vno (jak d\u00e1vno, si nikdo nepamatoval) byl jednou z vedouc\u00edch osobnost\u00ed Strany, t\u00e9m\u00ec\u00f8 na \u00farovni samotn\u00e9ho Velk\u00e9ho bratra, potom se zapletl do kontrarevolu\u00e8n\u00ed \u00e8innosti, byl odsouzen k smrti, ale tajupln\u00ec unikl a zmizel.     <Oen.1.1.27.4> Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared.     <Ocs.1.1.27.5>Programy Dvou minut nen\u00e1visti se den ode dne m\u00ecnily, ale nebylo jednoho, v n\u00ecm\u00be by Goldstein nefiguroval na \u00e8eln\u00e9m m\u00edst\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.27.5>The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure.     <Oen.1.1.27.6>He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party's purity.     <Ocs.1.1.27.7>V\u00b9echny dal\u00b9\u00ed zlo\u00e8iny proti Stran\u00ec, v\u00b9echny zrady, sabot\u00e1\u00bee, kac\u00ed\u00f8stv\u00ed a \u00fachylky vznikaly p\u00f8\u00edmo z jeho u\u00e8en\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.27.7>All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching.     <Ocs.1.1.27.8>Kdesi je\u00b9t\u00ec st\u00e1le \u00beil a kul svoje pikle; mo\u00ben\u00e1 za mo\u00f8em, pod ochranou

<Oen.1.1.27.8>Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even -- so it was occasionally rumoured -- in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.     <Ocs.1.1.28.2>P\u00f8i pohledu na Goldsteinovu tv\u00e1\u00f8 zakou\u00b9el v\u00bedy bolestnou sm\u00ecsici pocit\u00f9.     <Oen.1.1.28.2>He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions.     <Ocs.1.1.28.3>Byla to huben\u00e1 \u00beidovsk\u00e1 tv\u00e1\u00f8 s velkou aureolou ku\u00e8erav\u00fdch b\u00edl\u00fdch vlas\u00f9 a s malou koz\u00ed bradkou -- tv\u00e1\u00f8 chytr\u00e1, a p\u00f8ece jako by si zaslou\u00beila opovr\u00been\u00ed, s v\u00fdrazem seniln\u00ed hlouposti, kterou nazna\u00e8oval dlouh\u00fd tenk\u00fd nos, na n\u00ecm\u00be bl\u00edzko \u00b9pi\u00e8ky sed\u00ecly br\u00fdle.     <Oen.1.1.28.3>It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard -- a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched.     <Ocs.1.1.28.4>Trochu sv\u00fdm vzez\u00f8en\u00edm p\u00f8ipom\u00ednal ovci, i hlas m\u00ecl me\u00e8iv\u00fd.     <Oen.1.1.28.4>It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality.     <Ocs.1.1.28.5> Goldstein vedl sv\u00f9j obvykl\u00fd jedovat\u00fd \u00fatok na u\u00e8en\u00ed Strany -- \u00fatok tak p\u00f8ehnan\u00fd a zvr\u00e1cen\u00fd, \u00bee by byl i pro d\u00edt\u00ec pr\u00f9hledn\u00fd, a p\u00f8ece natolik vemlouvav\u00fd, \u00bee \u00e8lov\u00ecka napl\u00f2oval alarmuj\u00edc\u00edm pocitem, \u00bee by mu n\u00eckte\u00f8\u00ed m\u00e9n\u00ec rozumn\u00ed lid\u00e9 mohli uv\u00ec\u00f8it.     <Oen.1.1.28.5> Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party -- an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it.     <Ocs.1.1.28.6>Ostouzel Velk\u00e9ho bratra, odsuzoval diktaturu Strany, po\u00beadoval okam\u00beit\u00e9 uzav\u00f8en\u00ed m\u00edru s Eurasi\u00ed, obhajoval svobodu projevu, svobodu tisku, svobodu shroma\u00be\u00efov\u00e1n\u00ed, svobodu my\u00b9len\u00ed, hystericky k\u00f8i\u00e8el, \u00bee revoluce byla zrazena -- a to v\u00b9echno v rychl\u00e9m sledu mnohoslabi\u00e8n\u00fdch slov, kter\u00fd byl parodi\u00ed na obvykl\u00fd styl \u00f8e\u00e8n\u00edk\u00f9 Strany a obsahoval dokonce slova newspeaku; fakticky bylo v jeho \u00f8e\u00e8i v\u00edce slov newspeaku, ne\u00be by \u00e8len Strany norm\u00e1ln\u00ec pou\u00beil ve skute\u00e8n\u00e9m \u00beivot\u00ec.     <Oen.1.1.28.6>He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed -- and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally use in real life.     <Ocs.1.1.28.7>A po celou tu dobu, aby nikdo nepochyboval o tom, co Goldstein s takovou ok\u00e1zalou teatr\u00e1lnost\u00ed l\u00ed\u00e8il, pochodovaly za jeho hlavou na obrazovce nekone\u00e8n\u00e9 z\u00e1stupy eurasijsk\u00e9 arm\u00e1dy, sev\u00f8en\u00e9 \u00f8ady mu\u00be\u00f9

<Oen.1.1.28.7>And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army -- row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar.     <Oen.1.1.28.8>The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.     <Ocs.1.1.29.1> Nen\u00e1vist trvala sotva t\u00f8icet vte\u00f8in a polovina lid\u00ed v m\u00edstnosti za\u00e8ala neovladateln\u00ec, zb\u00ecsile pok\u00f8ikovat.     <Oen.1.1.29.1>Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.     <Ocs.1.1.29.2>Samolib\u00e1 ov\u00e8\u00ed tv\u00e1\u00f8 na obrazovce a hroziv\u00e1 s\u00edla eurasijsk\u00e9 arm\u00e1dy na n\u00ed -- to bylo

sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically.     <Ocs.1.1.29.3>Byl p\u00f8edm\u00ectem trvalej\u00b9\u00ed nen\u00e1visti ne\u00be Eurasie nebo Eastasie, proto\u00bee kdy\u00be Oce\u00e1nie vedla v\u00e1lku s jednou z t\u00ecchto

Powers it was generally at peace with the other.     <Ocs.1.1.29.4>To bylo p\u00f8inejmen\u00b9\u00edm podivn\u00e9.<Ocs.1.1.29.5> Goldsteina sice ka\u00bed\u00fd nen\u00e1vid\u00ecl a pohrdal

Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less.     <Ocs.1.1.29.6>Po ka\u00bed\u00e9 se znovu na\u00b9li bl\u00e1zni,

  <Oen.1.1.29.8>The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be.     <Oen.1.1.29.9>There were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there.     <Ocs.1.1.29.11>Byla to kniha bez n\u00e1zvu.     <Oen.1.1.29.10>It was a book without a title.     <Ocs.1.1.29.12>Lid\u00e9 o n\u00ed

za Winstonem za\u00e8ala vyk\u00f8ikovat \"Svin\u00ec!\" a zni\u00e8ehonic popadla t\u00ec\u00bek\u00fd slovn\u00edk newspeaku a mr\u00b9tila j\u00edm do obrazovky.     <Oen.1.1.30.6>The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out \"Swine! Swine! Swine!\" and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen.     <Oen.1.1.30.7>It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably.     <Ocs.1.1.30.8> Winston v jasn\u00e9m okam\u00beiku zjistil, \u00bee \u00f8ve s ostatn\u00edmi a zu\u00f8iv\u00ec kope patou do trno\u00bee.     <Oen.1.1.30.8>In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair.     <Ocs.1.1.30.9>Na Dvou minut\u00e1ch nen\u00e1visti nebylo tak hrozn\u00e9, \u00bee se jich \u00e8lov\u00eck musel \u00fa\u00e8astnit, ale \u00bee bylo nemo\u00ben\u00e9 nezapojit se.     <Oen.1.1.30.9>The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in.     <Ocs.1.1.30.10>Po t\u00f8iceti vte\u00f8in\u00e1ch se u\u00be nikdo nemusel p\u00f8etva\u00f8ovat.     <Oen.1.1.30.10>Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary.     <Ocs.1.1.30.11>Odporn\u00e1 ext\u00e1ze strachu a pomstychtivosti, touha zab\u00edjet, mu\u00e8it, rozsekat obli\u00e8eje kov\u00e1\u00f8sk\u00fdm kladivem, projela v\u00b9emi jako elektrick\u00fd proud a zm\u00ecnila ka\u00bed\u00e9ho i proti jeho v\u00f9li v je\u00e8\u00edc\u00edho \u00b9\u00edlence.     <Oen.1.1.30.11>A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic.     <Ocs.1.1.30.12>Byla to v\u00b9ak zu\u00f8ivost abstraktn\u00ed a p\u00f8\u00edmo nesm\u00ecrovan\u00e1, tak\u00bee

switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.     <Ocs.1.1.30.13>Winstonova nen\u00e1vist nebyla tak v jednu chv\u00edli v\u00f9bec nam\u00ed\u00f8ena proti Goldsteinovi, ale naopak proti Velk\u00e9mu bratrovi, Stran\u00ec a Ideopolicii.<Ocs.1.1.30.14>V takov\u00fdch okam\u00beic\u00edch c\u00edtil v srdci n\u00e1klonnost k osam\u00ecl\u00e9mu,

Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies.     <Ocs.1.1.30.15>A p\u00f8ece hned vz\u00e1p\u00ect\u00ed byl zase zajedno s ostatn\u00edmi a v\u00b9e, co se o Goldsteinovi \u00f8\u00edkalo, mu p\u00f8ipadalo pravdiv\u00e9.     <Oen.1.1.30.14>And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true.     <Ocs.1.1.30.16>V takov\u00fdch chv\u00edl\u00edch se tajn\u00e9 prokl\u00edn\u00e1n\u00ed Velk\u00e9ho bratra m\u00ecnilo na uct\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed, zd\u00e1lo se mu, \u00bee se Velk\u00fd bratr ty\u00e8\u00ed do v\u00fd\u00b9e jako neporaziteln\u00fd a neohro\u00been\u00fd ochr\u00e1nce, pevn\u00e1 sk\u00e1la proti hord\u00e1m z Asie, a Goldstein p\u00f8es svou izolovanost a bezmocnost a pochybnost, kter\u00e1 se vzn\u00e1\u00b9ela nad samotnou jeho existenc\u00ed, mu p\u00f8ipadal jako zlov\u00ecstn\u00fd \u00e8arod\u00ecj, schopn\u00fd pouhou silou sv\u00e9ho hlasu zni\u00e8it stavbu civilizace.     <Oen.1.1.30.15>At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization.     <Ocs.1.1.31.1>A tak bylo ob\u00e8as mo\u00ben\u00e9 p\u00f8ep\u00ednat libovoln\u00ec svou nen\u00e1vist t\u00edm nebo on\u00edm sm\u00ecrem.     <Oen.1.1.31.1>It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that by a voluntary act.     <Ocs.1.1.31.2>Jako \u00e8lov\u00ecku, kter\u00fd ve zl\u00e9m snu prudk\u00fdm pohybem odtrhne hlavu od pol\u00b9t\u00e1\u00f8e, poda\u00f8ilo se i Winstonovi p\u00f8en\u00e9st svou nen\u00e1vist z tv\u00e1\u00f8e na obrazovce na tmavovlasou d\u00edvku za n\u00edm.     <Oen.1.1.31.2>Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him.     <Ocs.1.1.31.3>Mysl\u00ed se mu m\u00edhaly kr\u00e1sn\u00e9, \u00beiv\u00e9 p\u00f8edstavy.     <Oen.1.1.31.3>Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.     <Ocs.1.1.31.4>Utlouk\u00e1 ji k smrti gumov\u00fdm obu\u00b9kem.     <Oen.1.1.31.4>He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon.     <Ocs.1.1.31.6>Zn\u00e1sil\u00f2uje ji a v okam\u00beiku vyvrcholen\u00ed j\u00ed pro\u00f8\u00edzne hrdlo.     <Oen.1.1.31.6>He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax.     <Ocs.1.1.31.7>L\u00e9pe ne\u00be kdy jindy si te\u00ef uv\u00ecdomoval, pro\u00e8 ji nen\u00e1vid\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.31.7>Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her.     <Ocs.1.1.31.8>Proto\u00bee je mlad\u00e1, hezk\u00e1 a bezpohlavn\u00ed, proto\u00bee by se s n\u00ed cht\u00ecl vyspat, co\u00be se nikdy nestane, proto\u00bee kolem rozko\u00b9n\u00e9ho, pru\u00ben\u00e9ho pasu, kter\u00fd p\u00f8\u00edmo vyz\u00fdval k n\u00ec\u00ben\u00e9mu objet\u00ed, m\u00ecla ohavnou \u00b9arlatovou \u00b9erpu, k\u00f8iklav\u00fd symbol cudnosti.     <Oen.1.1.31.8>He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.     <Ocs.1.1.32.1> Nen\u00e1vist vrcholila.     <Oen.1.1.32.1>The Hate rose to its climax.     <Ocs.1.1.32.2>Z Goldsteinova hlasu se stalo skute\u00e8n\u00e9 ov\u00e8\u00ed be\u00e8en\u00ed a jeho tv\u00e1\u00f8 se na okam\u00beik zm\u00ecnila v ov\u00e8\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.32.2>The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.     <Ocs.1.1.32.3>Potom se ov\u00e8\u00ed \u00e8um\u00e1k prom\u00ecnil v postavu eurasijsk\u00e9ho voj\u00e1ka, kter\u00fd se p\u00f8ibli\u00beoval, obrovsk\u00fd, stra\u00b9liv\u00fd, s rachot\u00edc\u00edm samopalem, a\u00be se zd\u00e1lo, \u00bee vysko\u00e8\u00ed z obrazovky,

seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats.     <Ocs.1.1.32.4>Ale v tom okam\u00beiku si v\u00b9ichni s \u00falevou zhluboka oddechli, proto\u00bee nep\u00f8\u00e1telsk\u00e1 postava se prolnula do tv\u00e1\u00f8e Velk\u00e9ho

obrazovku.     <Oen.1.1.32.4>But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired, blackmoustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen.     <Ocs.1.1.32.5>Nikdo nesly\u00b9el, co Velk\u00fd bratr \u00f8\u00edk\u00e1.     <Oen.1.1.32.5>Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.     <Ocs.1.1.32.6>Bylo to jen p\u00e1r slov povzbuzen\u00ed, takov\u00fdch, co se pron\u00e1\u00b9ej\u00ed v bitevn\u00ed v\u00f8av\u00ec, nedaj\u00ed se rozli\u00b9it jedno od

battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken.     <Ocs.1.1.32.7>Potom tv\u00e1\u00f8 Velk\u00e9ho bratra zase zmizela a m\u00edsto n\u00ed se objevila velk\u00fdmi p\u00edsmeny t\u00f8i hesla Strany: \"V\u00e1lka je m\u00edr\"\"Svoboda je otroctv\u00ed\"\"Nev\u00ecdomost je s\u00edla\"     <Oen.1.1.32.7>Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals: \"War is peace\"\"Freedom is slavery\"\"Ignorance is strength.\"     <Ocs.1.1.33.1>Tv\u00e1\u00f8 Velk\u00e9ho bratra zd\u00e1nliv\u00ec je\u00b9t\u00ec n\u00eckolik vte\u00f8in na obrazovce setrv\u00e1vala, jako by jej\u00ed otisk na s\u00edtnic\u00edch v\u00b9ech p\u00f8\u00edtomn\u00fdch byl p\u00f8\u00edli\u00b9 \u00beiv\u00fd, ne\u00be aby okam\u00beit\u00ec zmizel.     <Oen.1.1.33.1>But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately.     <Ocs.1.1.33.2>Drobn\u00e1 \u00beena s p\u00edskov\u00fdmi vlasy se vrhla dop\u00f8edu na op\u00ecradlo \u00beidle.     <Oen.1.1.33.2>The little sandyhaired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her.     <Ocs.1.1.33.3>Hore\u00e8nat\u00ec \u00b9eptala cosi jako \"M\u00f9j spasiteli!\" a rozp\u00f8\u00e1hla ruce k obrazovce.     <Oen.1.1.33.3>With a tremulous murmur that sounded like \"My Saviour!\" she extended her arms towards the screen.     <Ocs.1.1.33.4>Potom si skryla tv\u00e1\u00f8 do dlan\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.33.4>Then she buried her face in her hands.     <Ocs.1.1.33.5>Bylo z\u00f8ejm\u00e9, \u00bee od\u00f8\u00edk\u00e1v\u00e1 modlitbu.     <Oen.1.1.33.5>It was

B-B! ... B-B!\" -- over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first \"B\" and the second -- a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.     <Ocs.1.1.34.3>Vydr\u00beeli s t\u00edm asi t\u00f8icet vte\u00f8in.     <Oen.1.1.34.2>For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up.     <Ocs.1.1.34.4>Byl to refr\u00e9n, kter\u00fd se \u00e8asto oz\u00fdval ve chv\u00edl\u00edch vzru\u00b9en\u00fdch emoc\u00ed.     <Oen.1.1.34.3>It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion.     <Ocs.1.1.34.5>\u00c8\u00e1ste\u00e8n\u00ec to byl zp\u00f9sob sebehypn\u00f3zy, \u00famysln\u00e9 potla\u00e8ov\u00e1n\u00ed v\u00ecdom\u00ed rytmick\u00fdm hlukem.     <Oen.1.1.34.4>Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.     <Oen.1.1.34.5> Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold.     <Ocs.1.1.34.7>Ve Dvou minut\u00e1ch nen\u00e1visti se nemohl ubr\u00e1nit dojmu, \u00bee sd\u00edl\u00ed v\u00b9eobecn\u00e9 delirium, ale to podlidsk\u00e9 skandov\u00e1n\u00ed \" V-B!\" ho v\u00bedy napl\u00f2ovalo hr\u00f9zou.     <Oen.1.1.34.6>In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of \" B-B! ...

<Oen.1.1.35.6>It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes.     <Ocs.1.1.35.7>Zd\u00e1lo se mu, \u00bee O'Brien

      "text":" Kostel is situated on the south-western Slovenian border, by the River Kolpa, which is not only the line of separation between the Slovenian and Croatian languages, but also the political border between the former Carinthia and Croatia. The border goes from Grlj to Srobotnik, then up the slopes of the western edge of the Stru\u017enica forest, across the meadows between Dolenja Briga and Jesenov vrt, past Ajbel and Kapitol, to Ograjska gmajna, along the edge of Zdihovska stena, over the 695-metre peak of Jelovica, along the ridge above the River Kolpa and finishes at Grgelj. The area is sparsely populated, mostly covered with thick deciduous forests, characterised by the karst plateaus and numerous sinkholes, and peaks from 550 to 901 metres high (Kapi\u010d\u008d). Kostel was named after Costel, the castle and the settlement of the same name, which was first mentioned in 1336. The castle, which was built on a hill above the Kolpa, had several names: Castell, Khostl, Kostel (castellum = fortress or refuge), and Graffenwarth, the German version of the name meaning \u201cthe earl\u00c2\u00b4s guard\u201d. Kostel, with its scarce land, could not feed all its inhabitants, so they had to find other sources of income. The essential means were providing transport and peddlery. Travelling broadened the horizons of the Kostel peddlers. The Kostel customs, habits, songs, costumes and the language were developed and shaped on a geographically and historically limited territory. Their dialect has been formed by an indigenous population mixing with immigrants from Croatia and German neighbours. The process of the creation of this particular language began in the 16th century. The unspoilt Kostel countryside, with its flora and fauna, is a well-known and unique pearl. Of its natural beauties, the Kolpa should be mentioned, as it is one of the cleanest rivers in Slovenia. Not far from Fara, near the main road, it is possible to see the beautiful waterfall Ne\u017eica. Stru\u017enica is a typical karst plateau, with many sinkholes and peaks reaching 550 to 900 metres above sea level. The Ku\u017eelj wall, with a \u201cnatural window\u201d, rises above the settlement bearing the same name. The castle is a popular sight with visitors since it offers a wonderful view of the Kolpa valley. The entire complex of the castle is nearly as big as the one in Celje (which is the biggest in Slovenia), and the only one that combines the castle and the still living settlement below it. The Kolpa is suitable for fishing and other sports activities, especially rafting, kayaking or canoeing. Hunting tourism is also on the rise. And we should not forget to mention that ecological farming is developing in the area. "

Why are some of my data missing?     So far, we have not encountered a case where a survey simply disappeared. Based on previous experience, we can say that one of the following scenarios occurred:     Data filtering is turned on. The problem can be solved by removing all filters. In the 'DATA' - 'Browse' tab, you can filter the data based on variables, statuses, conditions or time periods (upper right side of the page above the data table).     Data were saved in the database (with all the respondents' answers), but the data file (which is generated from the database as a basis for analysis and export) was not generated properly. In some cases, especially when a survey has been inactive for a specific period of time, the data file must be generated manually (this is usually done automatically). This can be done in the 'DATA' - 'Browse' tab in the upper far right corner of the page by clicking on the two arrows icon \u2013 'Generate the data file again' \u2013 next to the 'Filters' icon.     In certain cases, when a respondent stated they completed the survey, but the survey editors cannot see their contribution, one of the following scenarios occurred:     the respondent completed another survey;     one of the editors of the survey mistakenly deleted the record by mistake; "

IMPORTANT NOTICE     Dear patients,     With the phasing-out of measures at the national level and the order of the Ministry of Health on temporary measures in the field of health care in view of containment and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, Community Health Centre Ljubljana has gradually begun increasing the scope of available health care services. Given the current epidemiological situation, from the point of view of safety of patients and medical staff alike, caution is still required, as well as the use of personal protective equipment and taking all the measures necessary to prevent corona virus infection.     Check-up with a GP and all other activities at the Community Health Centre Ljubljana are only possible after a prior appointment and consultation with the medical staff (over the phone or via e-mail). Your GP will assess your medical condition and reach a professional decision about any necessary treatment. The assessment can be made via e-mail, over the phone, or directly through a medical check-up.     If you have symptoms and show signs of COVID-19, your GP will refer you over the phone for swab testing and\/or a check-up at a COVID clinic, therefore never visit the health centre unannounced.     In the event of a life-threatening condition, call 112 immediately.     For your scheduled appointment, please arrive at the health centre no more than 5 minutes before the appointment.     At the entrance to the health centre, disinfect your hands and put on a surgical mask; wear the mask at all times for the duration of your visit.     Please observe a personal safety distance of at least 1.5 metres in all areas of the health centre.     On the day before your check-up, you should receive a call from the medical staff, who will check your medical and epidemiological condition by means of a questionnaire. It is advisable to print out and fill in the Questionnaire for the assessment of medical condition before treatment in the outpatient clinic at home, and bring it with you for your scheduled appointment.     Only healthy persons should come for a check-up. If a person falls ill, we kindly ask them to inform us of the fact and so waive their appointment time to somebody else.     ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES (PRESCRIPTIONS, SICK LEAVE ...)     All administrative services, such as issuing prescriptions for chronic therapy, referrals for check-ups, orders for medical devices, at the discretion of the GP possibly also sick leave, are performed remotely over the phone or, most preferably, by e-mail. When contacting us via e-mail, please state your name and surname, date of birth, Health Insurance Card number and the telephone number where you can be reached.     ENTERING THE HEALTH CENTRE     With the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the population, entering the Community Health Centre Ljubljana is limited and runs exclusively through the triage point. We ask all patients entering the health centre to provide the nurse with ACCURATE and TRUE information about their health condition, possible visits to high-risk areas and any close contact with infected persons. Providing untrue information means endangering one\u2019s own health and everyone else\u2019s.     WEEKENDS, PUBLIC HOLIDAYS AND NIGHT-TIME     On weekends, public holidays and at night, the paediatric emergency first-aid service (PNMP) and adult emergency first-aid service (SNMP) run in an unchanged manner. In case of symptoms suspected of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, cold, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting), make an appointment over the phone and do not visit the emergency service unannounced.     Before seeking emergency medical help, consider whether a check-up is necessary or whether you can wait for the workday to call your personal or a substitute practitioner.

The passing year has been marked by amazing artists that brought early music in the most beautiful venues of Slovenian cultural heritage, despite the bad conditions in Slovenian culture. Without your presence, dear visitors, artists and journalists, business partners and all our supporters, these events would not be the same as they were. We thank you all for your help in creating the great images of Seviqc Bre\u017eice festival. We opened a wide circle of negotiations at various levels to block the strong crisis situation of Slovenian culture, especially problematic in the non-governmental sector with strong international recognition, and create an excellent programme for your satisfaction and joy. We will still need some luck, but wherever we are talking about our problems and plans, we find affection and support. In any case, I hope that we will soon be introducing the brilliant 2019 programme. Let the holidays and upcoming New Year be filled with pleasant moments and beautiful experiences in the company of our beloved ones. See you in 2019!

      "text":" Novica, da je Kitajska pove\u00e8ala zaloge zlata v centralni banki za 75 %, nakazuje na njihovo zavedanje resnosti trenutne gospodarske krize. Dr\u00beave naj bi kvartalno poro\u00e8ale o svojih zalogah zlata, v praksi pa tega ne jemljejo preve\u00e8 resno. Kitajska namre\u00e8 ni javila nobene spremembe svojih zalog \u00bee od leta 2003. Pred kratkim pa so podali podatek, da je njihova zaloga iz 600 ton zrasla kar na 1.054 ton. Preberite ve\u00e8 v originalnem \u00e8lanku v angle\u00b9kem jeziku spodaj.     CHINESE PURCHASE COULD LEAD TO STRUCTURAL SHIFT IN GOLD HOLDINGS, SAYS WGC     24 April, 2009: News that China has increased its gold holdings by more than 75% is a clear     indication of the critical role that gold plays in central bank reserves, World Gold Council said     today.     Welcoming the announcement by China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) that the country\u2019s official gold reserves have risen from 600 tonnes in 2003 to 1,054 tonnes, the CEO of World Gold Council, Aram Shishmanian, said:     \u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s decision further demonstrates the leadership it is increasingly taking and its public recognition of gold\u2019s proven role as a store of value and portfolio diversifier. We are closely monitoring developments at other central banks to determine whether they will follow China\u2019s bold and thought-leading move, particularly those in Asia. \u201dThis news is also further evidence of the growing recognition of gold\u2019s growing prominence in providing stability in the uncertain financial markets, not only as a reserve asset but in the investment markets also.\u201d     As a result of the 454 tonnes bought since the last adjustment in 2003, China\u2019s gold reserves are now the fifth largest among national central banks in the world after the U.S, Germany, France and Italy.     The world\u2019s newest Central Bank, the European Central Bank, initially allocated 15% of its reserve asset portfolio to gold, but this figure has traditionally been much smaller among Asian central banks.     Note to editors:     For further comment on China\u2019s increase in gold reserves or for any other information please contact:     Matt Graydon, Head of External Relations, World Gold Council, on + 44 (0) 207 826 4716, or matt.graydon@gold.org     World Gold Council     World Gold Council (WGC) is a commercially-driven marketing organisation funded by the world\u2019s leading gold mining companies.

      "text":" Nordijski center Planica - Biro Stvar     Uporabljamo pi\u0161kotke.     Planica     Slovenian alpine valley under the Ponce mountains prides itself with a unique natural setting, exceptional sporting tradition, technical and construction heritage and ambitions for the development of Nordic Ski disciplines and as a tourist destination. The beginnings of the development of the sports infrastructure go back to the 1930s, when the first ski jump was built. Afterwards, in the desire to hold international competitions, bigger and bigger ski jumps were built and Planica has become a place for innovation, for creating new frames of the sporting discipline by breaking records and pushing the limits of that which is possible. The rich historical development is a testament of mutual cooperation between athletes, organisers and building designers, who have competed here, organised events and developed the infrastructure. The project solutions of the architectural office STVAR became part of the tradition.     02     Competiton     Because of its natural resources Planica represents a unique setting for the development of Nordic Ski disciplines, where unlike many other world arenas, the sports infrastructure is adapted to nature and not the other way around. Only after the independence of Slovenia, when investments couldn\u2019t keep up with development, the area saw degradation. A new carefully thought out project was required for restoration and modernisation, which would provide development for generations to come. This is why in 2009 in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Sport of RS and the Chamber of Architecture and Spatial Planning of Slovenia a public architectural and landscape call was held to select the most appropriate solution for the organisation of the Nordic Ski Centre Planica as the national sport centre. Tender documentation included the integral programme, functional and economic starting points for architectural, landscaping and infrastructural design. Solutions had to provide a functional design and coordinated development of sports and tourist infrastructure with due respect for natural environment and cultural heritage and to enable the implementation of sports and tourist activities, including the organisation of world-class competitions provided by the multi-purpose use of facilities and areas. The first two equal prizes were awarded to the elaborate of the office STVAR focused on architectural solutions and spatial disposition of buildings and the elaborate of the Abiro-AKKA studios focused on landscaping and architectural design and integration of sports facilities.     Project     The role of the investor on behalf of the Republic of Slovenia after the completed call was assumed by the Institute of Sport Planica, which coordinated the synthesis of both tender solutions. The project has followed the ambition for designing a programme and landscaping entry point to the valley of Tamar and Triglav National Park by joining the natural topography of the slopes with the terraced anthropogenic landscape of the valley. The subtle design with careful placement of buildings and sports infrastructure has pursued these principles. The course of competitive cross-country trails follows the configuration of the natural terrain and forest to the greatest extent possible, which preserves the original Alpine setting and the ski flying hill and seven ski jumps with its fan-like design create a unique landscaping trait with the central meeting point under the peak of the slope. The architectural design of the service buildings at the shoulder of the valley and heating facilities at the slope is extremely reserved. The one exception is the Central Building, which is as an architectural focus placed at the centre of the ski jumping and cross-country skiing section of the Nordic Ski Centre Planica. Based on the integral solutions a computer animation was made and the future centre was introduced to the international public. In 2012, the spatial act was coordinated, which enabled the project's integral implementation. Dividing the area to the ski jumping and cross-country skiing section, which is separated by the path to the Tamar valley was followed by the breakdown of project or construction stages. The office STVAR took over the planning of service and warm-up buildings and project management of the reconstruction of the Gori\u0161ek Brothers Flying Hill in the ski jumping section and within the cross-country section the planning of the Central Building together with project management of the corresponding infrastructure and landscaping.     constructed 2014-2015     Cross-country skiing trails     designed 2010-2015     For the entire centre a water supply system has been carried out as an independent project, which among other things includes bores for the exploitation of underground water, pumping station for irrigation and snow making in the \u010caplja building, as well as collection and reuse of rainwater through the reservoir and central control system. For every project engineering stage the investor has acquired a contractor with a public call. The construction of separate stages took place under joint construction supervision for the entire centre. The opening of the Nordic centre Planica took place in December of 2015. The projected investment value and actual construction costs were within plans and foreseen economic starting points of the call. The engineered programme and functional design of the entire arrangement and facilities was successfully tested already in 2015 and 2016 with world class events, such as the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup Finals and FIS Cross-country World Cup.     05     Nordic Centre     \u201cAfter six years and almost 50 million Euros, the Nordic Ski Centre Planica has become in terms of expertise and execution one of the most complex infrastructural projects in Slovenia, which is specific also for European standards. It is a morphological masterpiece, where the topography of the terrain almost completely blends in with the architecture and at the same time the architecture intervenes in the characteristic Alpine setting as minimally invasive as possible. The authors with their interdisciplinary approach managed to create a decent, almost ascetic conglomerate of different facilities, which because of its reserve appear even more majestic.\u201d Source: MMC RTVSLO, Trend Award, December 2015 "

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

In\u0161titut je imel naslednje naloge: znanstveno prou\u010devanje tehnolo\u0161kih, organizacijskih in ekonomskih problemov, pomembnih za razvoj tekstilne industrije,     standardizacija in izbolj\u0161ave, uvajanje novih tehnolo\u0161kih postopkov v tekstilno industrijo, dajanje strokovnih nasvetov tekstilnim podjetjem, izdelovanje novih projektov in preizku\u0161anje materiala za tekstilno stroko.     Kasneje je delovanje Tekstilnega in\u0161tituta postalo multidisciplinarno, saj je posegalo na podro\u010dja, ki s tekstilom niso bila povezana, vendar pa so predstavljala njegove razvojne mo\u017enosti (npr. tehni\u010dni tekstil, farmacevtski, kozmeti\u010dni in kemi\u010dni izdelki, strojegradnja ipd.). 27. 12. 2006 je Vlada RS na dopisni seji sprejela sklep, da se Tekstilni in\u0161titut Maribor zaradi nelikvidnosti priklju\u010di k javnemu zavodu In\u0161titut informacijskih znanosti.     Vir: Pokrajinski arhiv Maribor     Textile schools and Textile Institute Maribor     After World War II, textile schools developed in Maribor. The first industrial textile school was established in 1947. During its first year, 109 students from all republics of the former Yugoslavia were enrolled in the school. For two years, the school operated in the scope of the Maribor Textile Factory until it became an independent educational institution in school year 1949\/50.     The school was located on the Ulica kraljevi\u010da Marka Street, where the Textile Institute later developed. The school was closed in school year 1951\/52. In 1958, the Maribor Textile Factory and other textile factories established a new Industrial Textile School, which was renamed Technical Textile School in 1960. Later, the school was closed and the Technical Electro and Mechanical Engineering School Maribor received a textile section. In 1981, the Secondary Textile School was established, today known as the Secondary School for Design.     The Textile Institute Maribor was established with the decision of the Executive Council of the People\u2019s Assembly of the People\u2019s Republic of Slovenia in 1953. The institute had the following tasks: scientific study of technological, organisational and economic problems, important for the development of textile industry; standardisation and improvement, deployment of new technological procedures in the textile industry; professional counselling for textile companies; preparation of new projects and testing materials for the textile industry.     The Textile Institute soon became a multidisciplinary institution and operated in fields, that were not directly connected to textile, but represented developmental opportunities for the industry (e.g. technical textile, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and chemical products, machine manufacture, etc.). On December 27th 2006, the government of the Republic of Slovenia decided to affiliate the Textile Institute Maribor to the Institute of Information Science due to illiquidity. "

Methods: This prospective study involved 27 patients (27 eyes) scheduled for ambulatory cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. Optical coherence tomography was used to measure macular thickness, macular volume and RNFL thickness on operated eyes on the day before surgery and 1, 14 and 30 days after surgery. Contralateral non-operated eyes served as a control group (19 patients, 19 eyes).     Results: One month after surgery, 75% of the macula showed a significant increase in thickness (p<0.05). RNFL measurements revealed that mean values in the operated group did not increase compared with preoperative values (p>0.05).     Conclusion: These results confirmed the influence of uncomplicated cataract surgery on macular thickening 1 month after surgery. "

At present, no reliable quantification of such areas exists and significant transformation attempts or conversion strategies have not been developed. The potential value of AILs was hardly mentioned in previous alpine development programmes and institutional project reports.     The project aims to generate specific knowledge about AILs, to develop and test sustainable transformation strategies, transferable to other industrial landscapes all over the alpine region. In a multidisciplinary, transnational approach the project combines expertise in fields like spatial and landscape planning, socio-economic sciences, regional development etc. while directly cooperating with local communities on relevant case studies (pilot areas).     The project covers four main phases:     macro-regional survey of AILs and implementation of a web GIS platform;     comprehensive assessment of AILs actual condition, background and context through on-site analysis of selected Pilot Areas;     joint evaluation of AILs transformation potential and test-design in cooperation with local stakeholders;     synthesis and discussion of generated knowledge (processes, methods, tools) with observers, regional\/national stakeholders and experts in a conclusive AILs Forum.     The project will support local and regional stakeholders in the sustainable AILs transformation, providing them with practical recommendations for immediate action and clear strategic planning tools for the future.     Project overall objectives     The project\u2019s overall objective is to develop a common and highly transferable transformation strategy for AILs, evidencing and sustainably exploiting their potential in terms of cultural heritage, ecological connectivity, land-use planning and socio-economic regeneration. The sustainable transformation of AILs is especially important for the improvement of the living conditions for man and nature in the Alps because AILs are often located in key positions within the alpine environmental and infrastructural network. In addition, the aim is to enhance the unique, very valuable but partly underestimated cultural and natural heritage of the Alpine region, while reinforcing the regional identity around former industrial areas.     Project results     Increased general awareness of AILs a key resource for regional sustainable development (knowledge transfer).     Strengthened transnational Alpine identity by established cross-border cultural infrastructures, cooperatively managed by the alpine countries.     Intensified interaction and cooperation among development organisations, protecting and developing cultural (industrial) heritage.     New transnational development options e.g. between neighbouring communities\/ regions based on exchange of transformation experiences during test planning process (networking).     Well prepared transformation actors and qualified \u2018regional conversion pilots\u2019 due to new training tools (study module \"trAILs\").     TrAILs is supported by the INTERREG Alpine Space Programme of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Total co-financing amounts to 1,859.290,24 EUR "

      "text":" Fermi Masterclass 2019 - NASA in highschools     What is it?     Masterclasses (typically given by big experiments such as LHC) are International events which provide an opportunity for high-school students to experience first-hand data analysis. CAC\/UNG will organize such event, using the data a NASA satellite Fermi LAT on April 5th, 2019 in coordination with four Italian Institutions University of Bari, University of Perugia, University of Torino and University of Trieste.     The topic and objectives     The topic of the masterclass will be Active Galactic Nuclei and Multi-Messenger astrophysics. One of the great examples of modern multi-messenger astrophysics was a discovery of high-energy neutrino, which was detected simultaneously with gamma-rays from a flairing AGN (a faraway black hole), detected first by the Fermi LAT and shown schematically on the image to the right. Such discovery resulted in Science article.     During the Masterclass, students will learn the basic concepts in gamma-ray astronomy and will get a chance to analyze the light curve of AGNs first hand.     The goal of the exercise will be to localize the flaring of a powerful AGN, much like the one that resulted in detected neutrino emission in 2018. The results will then be compared with those from other astrophysics centers in Italy, who will perform a similar analysis in different time intervals and the light curve of this source will be drawn together.     Tentative Programme     10:00 -10:15 Welcome     10:15-10:45 Intro to Gamma-Ray astronomy     10:45-11:15 Intro to Black Hole (astro-) physics and multi-messenger astrophysics     16:15 \u2013 16:30 Comparison of student work with other institutions     16:30 \u2013 17:15 Video Call with NASA scientist \u2013 Prof. David Thompson from NASA Godard     17:15 End of activities     Who can apply and how to register?     The event is intended for interested high-school students. It is held during a school day, so the agreement from physics teachers will be needed.     To register, please send an email specifying your full name, school, class and the name of the physics professor to: fermi.masterclass.ung@gmail.com     Please note that the number of places is limited, attendance will be on a first come first served base.

      "text":" Digital transformation and freedom \"for\"     29.8.2017     Digital technology already provides extraordinary ways of connecting. Cooperation at personal level, within organisations or between organisations has been freed from old, clumsy and time-consuming operations. Thinking about the future of digital, technologically advanced world, freed from the old patterns of connecting and cooperation, I see a parallel with the concept of freedom \"from\" and freedom \"for\".     In very simplified terms, freedom \"from\" denotes being free from restrictions forced on an individual by others. The history is full of fights and revolutions in the name of liberation from such restrictions. Freedom \"from\" is an extremely important achievement, but can itself be a destructive force if it is not upgraded by freedom \"for\", with creativity and positive use of this liberty in order to live up to all our potentials. This requires true connection with others, which goes beyond the surface links of a conventional social relationship and well-established interactions, and leads to an entirely new form of connection with the whole world and self-realisation.     In practice, an increasing number of organisations recognise the positive effects of digital transformation on business results and on the relations and ways of cooperation within the organisation and outside it. There is an increasing number of those who accepted this technologically enabled freedom \"from\" the old patterns. However, what is important is the next step \u2013 realisation of freedom \"for\". What will be do with this new option for connecting?     If the present ways of cooperation are merely left to the inertia of technological progress, we can still reap the crops sown by digital transformation, but we cannot exploit all the potentials offered to us. I see the true creative potential of digital progress in a responsible setting up of a new system of cooperation, which will democratically include everybody, not only the rich and developed.

Zadnja aktivnost: 2009     Agent related articles (journals, conferences, projects, courses, technical reports)     We describe the use of KQML-like Agents and their compatibility with the World-Wide Web. One distinguishing characteristic of such agents is the necessity for a peer-to-peer protocol vs. the client-server protocol of HTTP. This is indicative of a major conflict between the web and agent paradigms that must be resolved for integration of the two technologies, both of which are useful for design and engineering applications. We also note that \"intelligence\" is not a necessary property of useful agents and is not helpful in distinguishing agents from other kinds of software.     This paper reviews the current state of the art in the research concerning the development of autonomous artificial intelligent agents.     Living in the computer age, we find that the \"information highway\" is truly a high-speed information center making some \"travelers\" dizzy. Intelligent software agents can help alleviate the problems with the amount of information received. What exactly is an intelligent software agent? They are autonomous computer programs, where their environment dynamically affects their behavior and strategy for problem solving.     This paper explores the treatment of intelligent agents as innovations. Past writings in the area of intelligent agents focus on the technical merits and internal workings of agent-based solutions. By adopting a perspective on agents from an innovations point of view, a new and novel description of agents is put forth in terms of their degrees of innovativeness, competitive implications, and perceived characteristics.     The control of autonomous intelligent robotic agent operating in unstructured changing environments includes many objective difficulties. One major difficulty concerns the characteristics of the environment that the agent should operate in. In unstructured and changing environments the inconsistency of the terrain, the irregularity of the product and the open nature of the working environment result in complex problems of identification, sensing and control.     The IntelliShopper is a shopping assistant designed to empower consumers. It is a personal assistant in that it observers the users while shopping and learns their prefernces with respect to various features that characterize shopping items.     Agent related articles (web)     A teleo-reactive (T-R) program is a mid-level agent control program that robustly directs an agent toward a goal in a manner that continuously takes into account the agent's changing perceptions of a dynamic environment. T-R programs are written in a production-rule-like language and require a specialized interpreter.     Seznam virov in nekaj programov T-R inteligentnih agentov.     Agent contests, challenges     This competition is an attempt to stimulate research in the area of multi-agent system development and programming by identifying key problems, collecting suitable benchmarks, and gathering test cases which require and enforce coordinated action that can serve as milestones for testing multi-agent programming languages, platforms and tools. We also expect that participating at the contest helps to debug existing systems and to identify their weak and strong aspects.     RoboCup is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing a standard problem where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined.

      "text":" Abstract Submission CLOSED Acceptance note July 1 Reduced early payment fee July 15     Dynamic treatment regimes as a prediction problem     Elja Arjas University of Helsinki and University of Oslo     Adequate medical treatment of many diseases, including different types of cancer, involves a sequence of treatment assignments over time. For an optimal allocation, each assignment of a new treatment should be allowed to depend adaptively on how the patient responded to the ones that were administered previously. The task of establishing a close-to-optimal dynamic treatment regime of this type for patients with different individual characteristics, based on the accrued follow-up information, offers several challenges which are both conceptual and technical. The purpose of this talk is to consider their solution from a Bayesian perspective, by combining tools from constrained nonparametric modeling of stochastic processes and their inference, and the consequent predictive distributions, with dynamic programming for establishing the optimum. While the ideas underlying this approach are general, practical considerations will often restrict their direct applicability, and require that certain simplifying assumptions in the modeling are employed. An example based on HIV data is considered as an illustration. "

      "text":" Once were winters     \u201cGrandpa, Mum showed me some photos of when you were young the other day. There was whiteness all around you. Was that some kind of a special powder you sprinkled around?\u201d says 10-year-old Tin to his grandfather. The year is 2060. For more than a decade, not a single snowflake has fallen in Slovenia, and most children have never seen snow.     Grandpa says with a smile: \u201cYou know, Tin, the white powder you saw in the photo was snow. Snow is water in a different physical state. It only appears when it's cold enough. That\u2019s when snowflakes fall from the sky instead of raindrops. Snowflakes are wonderful, soft crystal formations that bind with one another as they land on the ground, creating a soft, fluffy layer, suitable for all kinds of shenanigans. The Inuit who live in the North have a different name for every type of snow, and there are around 200 of them!\u201d The train of thought inadvertently takes him back to the past. Laughing, he decides to tell Tin about their snow adventures. And Tin\u2019s eyes light up.     \u201cSo, well... Where was I?\u201d says grandpa. \u201cYou were telling me about the snow and all the shenanigans,\u201d answers Tin. \u201cYes, of course. Well, here\u2019s what happened. Once were winters. Until I was about 30, we saw real, actual winter practically every year, covering the mountains with a blanket of snow several metres thick. Sometimes, snow also fell in the valleys. People used to complain because they had to remove snow from carparks, and because the cars were less obedient than they were in other seasons. But for those who loved nature and the mountains, snow was the greatest thing ever.\u201d His train of thought takes him back to those days. \u201cI remember that my parents took me skiing more or less every weekend. Skiing is similar to water skiing, with the only difference being that we used gravity to push ourselves forward as we were gliding over the snow. This was a really fun activity. You could either ski in a ski centre where a ski lift took you up the slope, or you could opt for cross-country skiing where you had to stick synthetic skin on your skis in order to mount with them, and remove the skin before descending. That was really something! Skiing over freshly fallen snow made you feel as if you were gliding over fluffy clouds.     \u201cWhoa, grandpa! Did you do anything else?\u201d asks Tin, who is really getting curious. \u201cYes, we also went sledding. This activity was mostly enjoyed by children, but even the adults loved to go sledding in order to awaken their inner child. In my twenties, I even took up sledding competitions on natural tracks. We travelled all over Europe and competed against other nations. The Austrians were the true champions; we mostly just thought of it as a fun thing to do together. But you could already see that our climate was changing.\u201d He continues: \u201cI remember the winter of 2012. We were attending a competition in the German town of Oberammergau. Since there was no snow in our country, we showed up for the event without training. In my broken German, I tried to explain to the other teams: \u201cwir habe kalt aber kein schnee\u201d (we have cold but no snow). Obviously, we didn\u2019t achieve any impressive results that season, but we still had a good time. But we had no idea that in the future we would be having neither cold nor snow. One of the negative traits of human beings is that we rarely think about the long-term consequences of our actions. Remember that.\u201d     Tin is interested in the environment, which is why he attends an environmental club. He remembers the teacher saying that, since 2000, summer droughts have been getting stronger. He asks his grandpa if he knows the reason, and his grandpa answers: \u201cWell, like I said, snow is nothing else but water in another physical state. Since snow crystals come in various shapes and sizes and since they bind with one another, they remain on the surface of the Earth for much longer than the usual water drops. A sufficient amount of energy or, rather, of heat then melts the crystals, transforming them into water drops that travel down ravines, streams and rivers towards the sea.\u201d He takes a sip of tea and continues. \u201cBack then, the snow blanket that remained in the mountains until June or even July used to serve as a huge water reservoir preventing drought. At the same time, water evaporated from snowfields into the atmosphere, causing rain to fall.\u201d Thinking about his neighbour Rudi, a farmer, he continues: \u201cThe snow was also useful for farmers since the soil was sufficiently moist before spring, which made it just right for sowing. Today, our neighbour Rudi must dampen the earth before sowing, thus using even more water.\u201d     \u201cOh no! But was there anything you could have done in order for the snow to stay?\u201d Tin seems unable to leave it alone. Grandpa scratches his head, averts his eyes and replies sadly:     \u201cSure, there was. If we could only somehow reset society at that time, and if we had all started doing something as individuals...     If we had gone all to work by bike instead of using a car. Instead, we each travelled to work alone in a car made for 5 passengers.     If we had used high-speed trains and not planes for travelling within a continent.     If we had become humbler and if we had bought less things. Instead, we were buying cheap Chinese and Indian clothes that we threw away after a couple of wears.     If we had followed a more prudent diet, one where cows were not optimised in order to produce meat but were optimised in order to simply be cows instead.     If we had bought locally grown produce. In January 2020, my kitchen counter was filled with fruit from 5 different countries at any given moment, not to mention the other ingredients in our pantry and fridge.\u201d     With a tinge of regret, Tin says: \u201cThis is really horrible. I\u2019d much prefer to see snow than have you enjoy 5 types of fruit in the middle of winter. And I prefer going to school on foot than having to suffer through summers without water. Luckily, a plant-based meat alternative was invented. What I wouldn\u2019t do to be able to jump into a pile of soft snow and ski, even if just once!\u201d He adds: \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m a little angry with you all. But, like you said, we really have the unfortunate trait of not being aware of the consequences of our actions.\u201d     Will our grandchildren really live in a world like this? Are we waving goodbye to white winters? Let\u2019s think about what we could each do in order to allow our grandchildren to enjoy the diversity of our beautiful planet. "

      "text":" Human cities: Challenging the City scale \/ Journeys in People-Centered design     About     Since 2014, the Human Cities network has been working on Challenging the City Scale: a pan-European project led by the Creative Europe programme to question the urban scale and investigate co-creation in cities. The Human Cities partners have carried out urban experiments in 11 European cities empowering citizens to rethink the spaces in which they live, work and spend their leisure time. Through conversations with people involved, the book examines how bottom-up processes and their design, tools and instruments generate new ideas to reinvent the city. It offers inspiration and insights to everyone, from practitioners and politicians to designers and active citizens, eager to try out new ways to produce more human cities together.

      "text":" In her photographic practice, Ana Stra\u017ee strikes a balance between the intimate game of capturing an image and responding to the visual phenomena of the external, media-saturated and image-overwhelmed world, which John Berger would describe as a global system of deception. The artist transforms her photographs into delightful artistic poses that carry multiple message structures. She places the photographed object or subject directly at the centre of the image, be it a still life motif or her own body, setting them out before us with aesthetic purity and thoughtful sensuality as an object of admiration or adoration. She also inserts a gaze into the photographs of the unusual states of \u201cthings\u201d, elements of kitsch and a covertly erotic emancipated play of nature and body. The three series in the exhibition gain their expressive power when we begin to lift the curtain of formal perfection in the rhythm of the repeating motifs.     The Garden of Eden project (2012\u20132016) prompts a reflection on the acceptance of nudity and the position of women in various religious and social traditions. The artist dons the naked female body with fashionable skirts so that the head cannot be seen and the view is obstructed \u2013 what is exposed is usually what remains hidden. With the choice of colours and materials of the figure, the image bears an easy reverberation of popular culture, which is grounded by the social context. The photographic series is accompanied by a video that encourages reflection on the unenviable static and multifaceted position of women in society, accompanied by a sense of shame. The work suggests the perception of an audacious female corporeality that can mean, on the one hand, a standard or object of desire, and on the other, an object of contempt or a complete taboo.     These Flowers Will Never Die (2016\u20132017) is a project that tells the artist\u2019s personal story about a gift, transience and memory. By continuously photographing dozens of almost withered bouquets of flowers, Ana Stra\u017ee creates a herbarium of memories that she heightens with a detailed depiction of the plants\u2019 decay on a white background, and in such a way at the same time also dissects transience through the stilled moment. Once a symbol of the giver\u2019s affection, it becomes a decaying product of time. The series very clearly expresses photography\u2019s potential to show nature visibly less alive. It is precisely this in-betweenness in time that creates a tension in the content when viewing the work.     In the last series of photographs Forbidden Food (2019\u2013) the artist presents contemporary still life. Using ordinary food (mainly fruit and vegetables), she exposes precise cross-sections, layering or revealing their texture and giving the object a new aura through the manipulation of the photogenic set-up. On the one hand, the series recalls the fetishisation of food, which has been one of the most popular themes in social media for some time. Namely, influencing is based on the illusion of the presented images, it expects the adoration of followers and the consumerism of both material and symbolic content. Among other things, the series of \u201cforbidden food\u201d represents a very plastic and creative response to the consumerist and exhibitionist logic of popular culture. The selected, aesthetically composed frames arouse the desire for complete indulgence. The food in its appearance becomes an object of admiration and desire, but the transformation itself renders it essentially useless and inedible in real life, and perishable in the short term. A peeled grapefruit chunk, sliced aubergine or a bunch of bananas are exposed by the artist with accessories such as beads, pins and paint so they become attractive sculptures to which she attempts to give a new appearance through a play of aesthetics. The result is not only the attractiveness of the gaze but the artist\u2019s seeming enjoyment of handling the food. With this series, the artist continues to reflect on the forbidden fruits and stereotypes of virtual paradises in society, which, among other things, challenge her to explore the boundaries of aesthetics and pleasure.     Ana Stra\u017ee (1982) received her master\u2019s degree on the theme of photography in contemporary art from the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Engineering in Ljubljana in 2013, majoring in Graphic and Interactive Communication. In 2009, she began to take part in photography competitions, receiving both local and international awards. Between 2013 and 2020, she presented her photographic projects in several group and solo exhibitions. These include her solo presentations at Plevnik Gallery \u2013 Kronkowska, Celje (2016, 2017) and Celje FOKUS Festival (2016, 2017), as well as group shows at Ra\u010dka Gallery, Celje (2018, 2019), Match Gallery, Ljubljana (2017), Gallery of Contemporary Art, Celje (2016, 2019, 2020), AQ Gallery, Celje (2013, 2014) and Tribeca Factory Interiors, Prato, Italy (2020). In recent years, her photographs have been featured by international photographic, fashion, design and art magazines, as well as digital platforms: PhotoVogue (Italy), Uncoated Editions (Berlin, Germany), F-Stop Magazine (Chicago, USA), The Artling (Singapore & Shanghai, China), Plain Magazine (Barcelona, Spain), Colossal (Chicago, USA). This month she received the Sienna International Photo Award (\u201cRunner Up\u201d of the Creative Photo Awards 2021) for her work from the series Forbidden Food. Her work from the Garden of Eden series is included in the permanent collection of the Center for Contemporary Arts. She lives and works in Celje. "

      "text":" Content Management Systems     Abstract     In an increasingly dynamic and complex enviroment that surrounds us, is an access to current informations, essential and necessary. Sites are getting more and more technologically advanced and have richer content, because of competition and stuggle for each new visitor on the site. Users require fresh, transparent, timely updated informations and friendly web services. Websites of companies which do not provide all of this, users tend to avoid it. More and more indispensable part of every company, institution or individual person, is their online presentation. When setting up your own web site, that meets user\u2019s requests, are often used CMS\u2019s (Content Management System). With CMS help, can users self-update informations on their site and save a lot of money and time. Which system to choose depends on their self and their desires. In this diploma thesis, I wanted to know how these tools work. I chose two free content management systems. These are Joomla and Drupal. For choosen CMS\u2019s I decided on their visibility around the world. In the context of diploma thesis, I presented and analyzed them. I described their features, installation steps, presented difference between the main concepts and analyze their important characteristics when choosing the right system.     Item Type:     Thesis (EngD thesis)     Keywords:     CMS, Content Management System, Joomla, Drupal, analysis "

Another notable project of Kraken is the regular series of evenings dedicated to short film at the Slovenian Cinematheque. Besides screenings, these events sometimes also feature discussions with guests from abroad, as, for example, Laura Walde of the Short Film Festival Winterthur.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

Cohesion by 2020     Cohesion Policy targets all regions and cities in the European Union in order to support job creation, business competitiveness, economic growth, sustainable development, and improve citizens\u2019 quality of life.     Cohesion Policy targets all regions and cities in the European Union in order to support job creation, business competitiveness, economic growth, sustainable development, and improve citizens\u2019 quality of life. Cohesion Policy underpins European solidarity and the bulk of Cohesion Policy funding is concentrated on less developed European countries and regions in order to help them catch up and reduce the economic, social and territorial disparities that still exist in the EU.     Cohesion Policy complements EU policies such as those dealing with education, employment, energy, the environment, the single market, research and innovation. In particular Cohesion Policy provides the necessary investment framework to meet the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy. In order to reach these goals and address the diverse development needs in all EU regions, EUR 351.8 billion \u2013 almost a third of the total EU budget \u2013 has been set aside for Cohesion Policy for 2014-2020.     In the 2014-2020 period Slovenia is eligible to EUR 3.312 billion under the European Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund of which EUR 159.8 million is earmarked for Connecting Europe Facility (for transport) and EUR 64 million for European Territorial Cooperation programmes. The remaining, i.e. majority, of the available funding will be spent to meet the Europe 2020 Strategy goals focusing on key areas of economic growth and job creation:     \u2022 research and innovation, \u2022 information and communication technologies, \u2022 enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, \u2022 supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy.     The European Commission has identified 11 thematic objectives in the framework of which the Member States finance European Cohesion Policy measures and thus contribute to meeting the Europe 2020 Strategy goals:     1. strengthening research, technological development and innovation, 2. enhancing access to, and use and quality of, ICT, 3. enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs, of the agricultural sector (for the EAFRD) and of the fishery and aquaculture sector (for the EMFF), 4. supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors, 5. promoting climate change adaptation, risk prevention and management, 6. preserving and protecting the environment and promoting resource efficiency, 7. promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures, 8. promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility, 9. promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination, 10. investing in education, training and vocational training for skills and lifelong learning, 11. enhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration.     In line with the EU methodology Slovenia will be divided into two cohesion regions, namely the cohesion region Zahodna Slovenija (west Slovenia) and the cohesion region Vzhodna Slovenija (east Slovenia). The cohesion region Zahodna Slovenija will be eligible to EUR 849 million and the cohesion region Vzhodna Slovenija to EUR 1.305 billion, namely under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). The funds available under the Cohesion Fund (CF) will not be divided for the two regions and the whole of Slovenia will be eligible to EUR 914 million for the construction of environmental and transport infrastructure as well as for sustainable use of energy.     The funding available under the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund will be spent for investing in research, human resources development, investing in educational system and training system to speed up entering the labour market, promoting entrepreneurship, start-ups, internationalisation, developing new business models for small and medium-sized enterprises and job creation. Investments will focus on areas with a clearly-defined market potential and areas which enhance added value and access to sources of financing. Slovenia will establish conditions for a long-term stable environment which will \u2013 by taking into account the societal challenges (demographic movements, environmental pressures, access to food, etc.) \u2013 promote the development of new high-quality jobs and preserve the existing jobs under the changed economic structure.     Primarily investment will focus on supporting the so-called soft topics and will ensure combination of measures covering investment in human resources, activation, mobility, research, development and innovation and greater energy and material efficiency. The 2014-2020 period thus no longer focuses on regional and\/or sectoral projects but on integrated and well-developed projects which will contribute to meeting the set objectives\/results. Regional projects will be financed in the framework of thematic priority axes and on the basis of the division into two cohesion regions. Due to the fact that Slovenia is eligible to a smaller amount of EU funding if compared to the 2007-2013 programming period, Slovenia will have to use the available funds very efficiently in all areas.

      "text":" Opis: Flexible non-volatile optical memory thin-\ufb01lmtransistor device with over 256 distinct levelsbased on an organic bicomponent blendTim Leydecker1, Martin Herder2, Egon Pavlica3,GvidoBratina3,StefanHecht2*, Emanuele Orgiu1*and Paolo Samor\u00ec1*Organic nanomaterials are attracting a great deal of interest for use in \ufb02exible electronic applications such as logiccircuits, displays and solar cells. These technologies have already demonstrated good performances, but \ufb02exible organicmemories are yet to deliver on all their promise in terms of volatility, operational voltage, write\/erase speed, as well asthe number of distinct attainable levels. Here, we report a multilevel non-volatile \ufb02exible optical memory thin-\ufb01lmtransistor based on a blend of a reference polymer semiconductor, namely poly(3-hexylthiophene), and a photochromicdiarylethene, switched with ultraviolet and green light irradiation. A three-terminal device featuring over 256 (8 bitstorage) distinct current levels was fabricated, the memory states of which could be switched with 3 ns laser pulses.We also report robustness over 70 write\u2013erase cycles and non-volatility exceeding 500 days. The device was implementedon a \ufb02exible polyethylene terephthalate substrate, validating the concept for integration into wearable electronics andsmart nanodevices.

The results confirm that spatial variation of electric field between the electrodes crucially determines transport of photogenerated charge carriers through the organic layer. Time-of-flight measurements of photocurrent demonstrate that the transit time of photogenerated charge carrier packets drifting between the two electrodes decreases with increasing travelling distance. Such counterintuitive result cannot be reconciled with the spatial distribution of electric field between coplanar electrodes, alone. It is also in contrast to expected role of space-charge screening of external electric field. Supported by Monte Carlo simulations of hopping transport in disordered organic semiconductor layer, we submit that the space-charge screens the external electric field and captures slower charge carriers from the photogenerated charge carrier packet. The remaining faster carriers, exhibit velocity distribution with significantly higher mean value and shorter transit time.

This gives rise to long-range potential fluctuations, which govern the electronic transport through delocalized states in organic crystalline layers. This concept is employed to formulate an analytic model that explains a negative field dependence coupled with a positive temperature dependence of the charge mobility observed by a lateral time-of-flight technique in a high-mobility crystalline organic layer. This has important implications for the further understanding of the charge transport via delocalized states in organic semiconductors.

High TOF mobility has been revealed that it is consistent with the delocalized nature of the charge transport in this material, yet it featured a positive temperature dependence at T \u2265 295 K. Moreover, the mobility was surprisingly found to decrease with electric field in the high-temperature region. These observations are not compat- ible with the conventional band-transport mechanism. We have elaborated an analytic model based on effective-medium approximation to rationalize the puzzling findings. The model considers the delocalized charge transport within the energy landscape formed by long-range transport band-edge variations in imperfect organic crystalline materials and accounts for the field-dependent effective dimensionality of charge transport percolative paths. The results of the model calculations are found to be in good agreement with experimental data.

Organic semiconductors were small molecules like corannulene, perylene and pentacene derivatives, polymers such as polythiophene and benzothiophene derivatives, and graphene, along with combinations of these materials in heterojunctions or composites. The first part of this study is focused on the photoexcitation energy influence on the transient photoconductivity of non-crystalline curved \u03c0-conjugated corannulene layers. The enhanced photoconductivity, in the energy range where optical absorption is absent, is deduced from theoretical predictions of corannulene gas-phase excited state spectra. Theoretical analysis reveals a consistent contribution involving transitions to Super Atomic Molecular Orbitals (SAMOs), a unique set of diffuse orbitals typical of curved \u03c0-conjugated molecules. More, the photoconductivity of the curved corannulene was compared to the \u03c0-conjugated planar N,N\u2032-1H,1H- perfluorobutyldicyanoperylene-carboxydi-imide (PDIF-CN2), where the photoexcitation energy dependence of photocurrent closely follows the optical absorption spectrum. We next characterized charge transport in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) layers deposited from solution. Our results indicate that time-of-flight (TOF) mobility depends on the photoexcitation energy. It is 0.4\u00d7 10 \u22123 cm 2 \/Vs at 2.3 eV (530 nm) and doubles at 4.8 eV (260 nm). TOF mobility was compared to field-effect (FET) mobility of P3HT field-effect transistors (OFETs). The FET mobility was similar to the 2.3 eV excitation TOF mobility. In order to improve charge mobility, graphene nanoparticles were blended within a P3HT solution before the deposition. We found that the mobility significantly improves upon the addition of graphene nanoparticles of a weight ratio as low as 0.2 %. FET mobility increases with graphene concentration up to a value of 2.3\u00d7 10 \u22122 cm 2 \/Vs at 3.2 %. The results demonstrate that phase segregation starts to influence charge transport at graphene concentration of 0.8 % and above. Hence, the graphene cannot form a bridged conduction channel between electrodes, which would cancel the semiconducting effect of the polymer composite. An alternative approach to enhance mobility is to optimize the molecular ordering of organic semiconductors. For that purpose, we studied an innovative nanomesh device. Free-standing nanomesh devices were used to form nanojunctions of N,N\u2032- iiDioctyl-3,4,9,10-perylenedicarboximide (PTCDI-C8) nanowires and crystalline bis(triisopropylsilylethinyl)pentacene (TIPS-PEN). We characterized the photocurrent response time of this novel nanomesh scaffold device. The photoresponse time depends on the photon energy. It is between 4.5 \u2212 5.6 ns at 500 nm excitation wavelength and between 6.7 \u2212 7.7 ns at 700 nm excitation wavelength. In addition, we found that thermal annealing reduces charge carrier trapping in crystalline nanowires. This confirms that the structural defects are crucial to obtaining high photon-to-charge conversion efficiency and subsequent transport from pn junction in heterostructured materials. Structural defects also influence the power conversion efficiency of organic heterostructured photovoltaics (OPVs). Anticipating that polymers with different backbone lengths produce different level of structural defects, we examined charge transport dependence on the molecular weight of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2- ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2- ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) from 50 kDa to 300 kDa. We found p-type hopping transport in PTB7-Th, characterized by 0.1 \u2013 3\u00d7 10 \u22122 cm 2 \/Vs mobility, which increases with temperature and electric field. The polymer molecular weight exhibits a non-trivial influence on charge transport. FET mobility in the saturation regime increases with molecular weight. A similar trend is observed in TOF mobility and FET mobility in the linear regime, except for the 100kDa polymer, which manifests in the highest mobility due to reduced charge trapping. The lowest trapping at the dielectric interface of OFET is observed at 200 kDa. In addition, the 200 kDa polymer exhibits the lowest activation energy of the charge transport. Although the 100 kDa polymer indicates the highest mobility, OPVs using the 200 kDa polymer exhibit the best performance in terms of power conversion efficiency.

These samples comprised an organic semiconductor layer whose thickness is on the order of a \u03bcm or less, and thus mimic the structures of organic thin film transistors. In the review we emphasise the importance of considering spatial variation of electric field in these, essentially two-dimensional structures, in interpretation of photocurrent transients. We review the experimental details of this type of measurements and give examples that demonstrate exceptional sensitivity of the method to minute concentration of electrically active defects in the organic semiconductors as well as the capability of probing charge transport along the channels of different mobility that reside in the same sample.

      "text":" \u010crna gora     Orjen     Orjen is a limestone mountain massif north-west from the Bay of Kotor (Morinjski zaliv, Tivatski zaliv, Hercegnovski zaliv). The western most area of Orjen is in Bosnia and Herzegovina, other area of this mountain range is in Montenegro. Features of Orjen are glacial and karst relief with the magnificent vegetation as munikas - local pine trees. The highest peak of Orjen is Zuba\u010dki kabao (1894 m). This area with Crkvice is with the most precipitation in Europe (over 5000 mm per year). Orien Mountain was a borderline between Austrian and Otoman Empire. Fortresses and excellent constructed military roads built by Austrian army are forgotten historic heritage of this area.     The blog from September 2007:     Climate changes and talking about the present dramatic and the unusual weather behavior are \"in\" and popular debate, but only 8.000 - 10.000 years ago the climate changes were much more dramatic. Huge glaciers were covering Northern and the Central Europe, Alps were under the ice. The landscape has changed dramatically. Nowadays glaciers are only a pale picture of the past. Only a decade ago Slovenia had three small glaciers in the Alps (which were only modest miniatures of the huge Ice Age glaciers): Triglavski ledenik, Ledenik pod Skuto and Ledenik pod Prisankom. Today there are only gravel and moraines which indicates that there were glaciers.     Thousand kilometers southern in the Southern Balkan, glaciers of the Dinaric Mountains most probably disappeared in the time period of the end of the last Ice Age. Exceedingly interesting area was Orjen massif, which is situated on the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina, precisely Republika Srbska and Montenegro above the Bay of Kotor. The mountain range of Orjen is geologically from the s limestone of the Cretaceous period. The whole area is with the evident glaciokarst. The process of the karst is very distinctive but the former glaciers left evident landscape with U-shaped valleys and cirques. This area is with the precipitation of over 4000 mm up to 6000 mm and even more, which is among the highest in Europe so the expectation was that the process of the karst was very fast and intensive.     But where were the edges of the glaciers? Where was the lowest point? Was there a connection with the Bay of Kotor? How glaciers behaved on the karst and what was the influence of the ice to the karst processes? Those were some questions which lead Slovenian geomorphologists and climate researchers and their students to study this area in the summer 2007.     The base of the study was the detailed research of the ground navigating over the old Austrian military roads which are surprising still appliable for the transport even not renewed after the 150 years, and hiking over the wilderness. The part of the terrain research and the study has taken the place over the late spring with the final conclusions in the beginning of the September 2007.     The summer 2007 was extraordinary - the extreme lack of water so we had decided to carry the needed base potable water supplies from Slovenia. The group was divided into three teams of 6-7 persons, each team with the specific task and the area of the interest. The area was remote with no electricity so the only technical tools were GPS-s and classic maps, no notebooks with digital maps and GIS-s software tools. However... my tool, beside GPS was digital camera with the fisheye lens which I used to map the geomorphological landmarks of the area of Orjen and present them with the VR-panoramas.     Base camps of the expedition were in the territories of Republika Srbska (BiH) and Montenegro on the altitude of 1200 m up to 1800 m which was quite high as the sea was only few kilometers away. The highest peak of Orien is Zuba\u010dki kabao (1894). As the summer was dry there were constant burning forests and the bush. The result of the fire was a dim landscape which is evident on the displayed panos. Once we were even fire-fighters...     The evidences of the former glaciers were different moranines which remained after the glaciers melted away. We followed the lateral moraines and map the extremes. The landscape with U-valleys and cirques indicated \"classical\" mountain glaciers but we found also traces of the glacier which maid be the plateau type. The findings were surprising and somehow \"weird\" but the picture was every day clearer as we had composed our separate findings. The ground work was from the early morning to the late afternoon or even the night, but as it was interesting the day ran out even too fast. "

      "text":" The Glossary of Common Knowledge is a project of the European confederation of museums L\u2019Internationale initiated by Moderna galerija in 2014 and organised cross-sectionally from working seminars and public conferences. The goal of the project is to compile a glossary of art terminology that differs substantially from what is found in the existing literature on art. This time, the referential field is Subjectivisation. We also prepared a special public radio show, accessible on L'Internationale Online and partly also on Radio Student, Ljubljana, produced by Radia Al Hara (Palestine), Bridge Radio (Copenhagen) and L'Internationale Online.     SEMINAR     Each edition begins with a public event, followed by several working days, in which a group of invited participants who act as \"narrators\" proposing new terms around a given \"referential field\u201d. All the sessions of the seminar will be recorded and published on the Glossary of Common Knowledge website.     The Glossary of Common Knowledge (GCK) seeks to find common knowledge to speak about less visible stories in contemporary art, and to address systems that govern our ways of thinking in art and beyond. The project is ongoing since 2014 and is based on discussions surrounding six referential fields (Historicisation, Subjectivisation, Geopolitics, Constituencies, Commons, and Other Institutionality). The first series of discussions was published in 2018 and now we are working on the second edition. For this second series we are working again with these same referential fields in order to re-examine how the conditions in our cultural landscape have changed. In May 2021, a group of narrators is being invited to propose terms for the Glossary, to speak about the notion of Subjectivisation with respect to their current research and\/or artistic practice and shifting cultural conditions. With this referential field we are interested in interpretations of subjectivities that are critical toward dominant ways of producing subjectivisation and the exploitation and commodification of intellect and affect by capital. This subjectivisation is produced from the rebellion and critical situatedness of both individual and collective.     We understand subjectivisation as a potentially transformative process that confronts the judgments and biases in our societies and poses critical questions about who we are, and how we act in the world. It works in the direction of forming aesthetical, ethical and political statements and decisions that are to an extent unrepresentable, historically situated, fragmented and inconsistent, yet capable of weaving political affinities, that bring about social transformation. A collective subjectivity that experiences common trauma may form a solidarity movement that challenges systematic violence in political realities despite the existing intersectionality between its members. The opposite of subjectivation is identification; that is, the police activity of assigning to each body its \u2018natural\u2019 place and function. The process of subjectivisation is about citizens becoming makers and not only subjects of public policies and institutions. In a world facing pandemic, climate change, migrations, economic and social struggle, terrorism and an array of new communication technologies we observe growing social, political and economical tension resulting in an ever-more stratified society. Subjectivity-as-encounter is a way to promote the possibility of sharing borders, margins and thresholds with empathy.     Organised by the L'Internationale confederation with HDK-Valand Academy of Art and Design at the University of Gothenburg (Gothenburg, Sweden) and Moderna galerija (Ljubljana, Slovenia)     PUBLIC PROGRAMME     On the occasion of 2021\u2019s Glossary of Common Knowledge seminar on Subjectivisation L\u2019Internationale Online proposes to engage a fluid network of listening sites where provocations on the relations between\/of essentialism and subjectivisation may be positioned and disseminated, thereby offering greater accessibility and geographical reverberance. The shift to digitisation caused by the pandemic provides a grounding from which to enquire into the physicality of interaction and therefore we invite participants, readers and listeners to actively engage with their senses over various forms of frequencies via a series of radio programs. Recognising the polyphony of symphony, an aim is to catalyse a space through which to negotiate theories, practices and entanglements around essentialism and subject becoming, through radio programs that unpack sonic migration, what is essential to decolonial research and disembodied performances. In identifying radio as a potential form and circulatory mechanism we seek to acknowledge a poly-cultural and cacophonous approach that is also attentive to radio as a significant media amidst the global pandemic. Our proposition is to enter into dialogue with a series of radio stations - as critically situated sites of radio production and broadcasting - across differing locales in order to further develop debate on the concept of subjectivisation, which is a theme in the development of the current Glossary project. We understand subjectivisation, broadly, as a potentially transformative process that confronts judgments and biases in our societies and discussions which can pose critical questions about who we are, how we act in the world; and in what ways particular situations, structures and resulting forms of exclusion inform and constrain what is made possible.

RADIO DRAMA | Our Movements Are Loud     Production: Bridge Radio, Copenhagen, 29:05 min     Tuesday, 11 May 2021, on L'Internationale Online and Sunday, 16 May 2021, 6 p.m., Radio \u0160tudent, R A D A R, Ljubljana     The radio drama is an experimental radio play produced collectively by people without Danish citizenship, linked to each other through their experience of the asylum system in Denmark. The radio play consists of different perspectives, positions and voices that coincide in a story about the fight against expulsion. These interwoven stories take place in an imaginary scenario and are told by activists working inside and outside the asylum camps. The stories in the radio play are based on real events that have taken place in asylum camps, airplanes and in larger protests that The Bridge Radio and its network has participated in.     The process of creating the radio play started with a workshop in writing and drama for radio with writer Athena Farrokhzad, director Saga G\u00e4rde and sound designer Arash Pandi.     Sound recordings from the Bridge Radio Archive: Quotes by Audre Lorde, Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture, Nicholas De Genova and Bertolt Brecht.     Radio drama workshop: Athena Farrokhzad and Saga G\u00e4rde.     Recordings and editing: The Bridge Radio.     Sound design: Arash Pandi.     RECORDED POEMS by Napo Masheane in collaboration with Francis Lo, What About Struggle and What About Support     Recorded poems by Napo Masheane in collaboration with Francis Lo from the upcoming e-publication of the L'Internationlale Online edited by Corina Oprea and Jeniffer Hayashida on the proposition to resituate the critique of catastrophe discourse in urgent pasts and presents. What about support and what about struggle is an international speculative translation project where writers and artists across a range of geopolitical contexts have responded to Francis Lo\u2019s work across languages, forms, and aesthetic-political concerns.

      "text":" Position of the Association of Journalists and Publicists (ZNP) regarding the official government dispatch on the state of affairs in the Slovenian media space and the assessment of the situation of the media in Slovenia     The official government letter of explanation about the state of affairs in the Slovenian media space, published on the Council of Europe's online Platform for Freedom of Expression 1in response to alarming reports of the present government\u2019s pressures on journalists - has provoked a strong backlash from dominant media and some policymakers. However, regardless of the political (in)appropriateness of such an approach of the government, the content of the government\u2019s dispatch is, according to an assessment of ZNP, accurate. It highlights certain key problems of the Slovenian media space to which ZNP has often warned in its reports.     One of the main problems of the Slovenian media space is the lack of pluralism. The media sphere is characterized by strong political unbalance since the majority of the journalists and editors more or less openly favor the political left option.     To understand the present media situation it is necessary to get familiar with the basic historical facts of the recent past which were empirically researched in at least two papers (Study of Media Freedom and Autonomy of the Media Space in the Republic of Slovenia in 2007, Media Freedom in Slovenia 2008).     It is a fact that in Slovenia the political forces which were in decision making positions in the times of Yugoslavia along with their ideological followers, (re)emerged after the Independence war and after the fall of the dictatorship from the previous Communist regime. It is not uncommon that the journalists, who were before 1991 formally in the service of the only authorized party - the Communist Party- during the previous undemocratic regime, became journalists, editors, and executives of many media after 1991. Some of them who took over were even agents of the former Yugoslavian secret police. The story of such a case was run in the Sunday Times in 2012.     Another specific of the Slovenian media space is that the left-wing political forces control most of the country's capital and therefore directly influence media policy, to which the public broadcaster RTV Slovenia is no exception. It has become increasingly evident that the dominant media have been following as closely as possible the political agenda of the left-wing parties and those that were in control in the previous undemocratic system.     There are practical examples of this trend. One common practice is the orchestrated dominant media launching of so-called \"new faces\", introduced by the left-wing political parties. Another is the uncritical willingness to support the interests of the left-wing political leaders, which is particularly outstanding in the Electoral confrontations. Topics discussed mostly follow the agenda-setting of the left-wing option. Another anomaly in the Slovene dominant media is the selection of guests on political TV and radio programs. The choice is in the strong disproportion between left and right-wing and independent political orientation of the guests.     It is a rather common practice that the editors from dominant media tend to harass or even dismiss journalists, including members of our association, who act autonomously and professionally. On the other hand, those who are committed to the mainstream agenda are rewarded and gain more influence, despite severe slips and they are often in risky positions prone to corruption. The dominant media, under the control of the political left, have been often (ab)used for battling their opponents using false or fake news, which is very well documented in Jan\u010di\u010d\u2019s book.     The profound lack of journalistic impartiality in the dominant media has become even more evident when in difficult times due to the outbreak of the COVID \u2013 19, the government of Mr. Janez Jan\u0161a took over. Much to our surprise the radical left-wing journalists along with the editors (including some of the most influential editors and journalists of national service RTV Slovenia ) frequently displayed their political views against the present government, mainly on the social networks and openly agitated against the new government. Least to say that such conduct is not very professional since we were in the middle of the government crisis (the previous has suddenly and quite unexpectedly stepped down) and health crisis.     The work of those journalists and editors has not been focused on informing the public and offering impartial information, but they prefer to use spinning and other means, such as amplifying small slips of the government's officials or exaggerating unimportant information. Unfortunately, their media agenda is directed against the government and not so much to disseminate important information in the present situation regarding the health and economic crisis.     The low professionalism of journalists and media producers in the dominant media has been mentioned already. Besides that, they are often highly politicized or even radicalized, many of them act as political activists or \/and ideological agitators, promoting a particular ideology or political agenda, usually from the left political spectrum, on the various social media. It is also rather often that so-called dominant media, including public service RTV Slovenia, often respond in an orchestrated manner to events that ally them to left ideology. In that manner , they strongly affect the citizens' perceptions of the political and social situation in Slovenia and their evaluation of the policies, political actors and other stakeholders. The orchestration of dominant media and the lack of media pluralism consequently project a distorted media picture to the broad public. In the mentioned context it is particularly problematic the biased attitude of the public media, RTV Slovenia, the national broadcaster, which activities are funded by all of the taxpayers, regardless of their political or worldview.     At the present moment, the broad public and the experts follow with the great interest strong polemics between the political actors who have been the victims of the dominant media lynch and the media workers that were actively involved. ZNP is not in favor of such polemics but emphasizes that to understand the media situation in Slovenia it is necessary to understand the historical events in Slovenia.     The media ownership, lack of pluralism and low professionalism are not the only causes of the biased media in Slovenia. The anomaly is also in the System. For example, the Ministry of Culture has paid no or scarce attention to supporting independent media or independent journalists. In the previous one-party regime the journalists were classified as political workers and the pluralism was not allowed or it was sanctioned. Therefore there was no independent media.     Still today the independent journalist and publicists are failing to register and obtain the status in the evidence of the Ministry of Culture, despite their politically independent and valuable contributions. On the other hand, the status which supports cultural, arts and creative workers are, for example, granted to cinema operators and puppet designer\/technologists, as they are listed in the register among with 61 professions. The present possibility of independent journalists to compete for media grants, unfortunately, does not eliminate the anomaly, but - conversely - reinforce the existing cartel situation.     The anomaly in the Slovene media space is a burning issue and to overcome the present situation several changes have to be introduced, but as expected most of them are not to the dominant media liking.

Da je to res vidimo njihove rezultate - naklade in branosti so zaradi nesposobnega vodenja tako padle, da se nekateri mediji ne bodo nikoli ve\u010d pobrali.

      "text":" What an entrepreneur needs to know about marketing     What an entrepreneur needs to know about marketing     06.05.2008 ob 09:53     Marketing can be compared to football \u2013 within the comfort of one\u2019s sofa, everyone is the expert, noticing every mistake, foreseeing every move. On the football field, however, there is a completely different story \u2013 the field is too big and therefore obscured, we cannot even see all the players and the opposing team, the competition, is on the lookout for our every mistake. Similar situations play out in the world of marketing when we decide to realise that first action. It is then that we find that matters are not so simple and obvious. If we embark upon it unprepared and with insufficient knowledge, the worst case scenario is that there is no response to the product and the money invested in the development and realization of the action has been practically thrown away. Another alternative is to hire professionals to carry out the action, which of course costs money but increases effect and response. What is Marketing Marketing means action: action directed towards acquiring clients, increasing sales, improving the recognition of the company, its products and its services etc. The victors in marketing are always the ones with the most forcible and effective ideas, the bolder ones, but also the more qualified\/educated. You should therefore think in terms of concrete action, using modern and innovative marketing approaches. Marketing aims at attracting attention, whether to the company products or its services. It represents a network of activities performed by the company and its employees, especially in smaller companies where practically every employee is a salesman. Irrespective of their workplace, everyone can all contribute to an action\u2019s success. Marketing therefore consists of everything that an entrepreneur does on the market \u2013 from the presentation of all documents, invoices, records, and complete business correspondence, to contacts with the buyers, suppliers, partners, potential employees, journalists, and politicians. The entrepreneur is the one responsible for presenting to his or her employees their role in the company\u2019s marketing activities: how to behave and primarily explaining what the goal is that the entrepreneur wishes to realise on the market. Only this will allow each company member to fulfil their role correctly. Unless the company\u2019s reputation and recognition is developed systematically, it may happen that the image on the market differs completely from your wishes and plans. The goal of every marketing strategy is a long-term increase of sales; however, there are differences in the marketing of small and big companies. For a small company, the first challenge is establishing a contact with potential buyers as directly and effectively as possible and, if possible, at the lowest possible price. The marketing of big companies or those companies marketing wholesale products, is usually more dispersed, while the most effective way for small companies is to achieve specifically set goals in a more direct and forcible way. What Marketing is Not Marketing does not in any way imply lying, manipulating or selling castles in the clouds only to convince the buyer to buy, even if it is done once and never again. If you know of at least one \u201cmiracle product\u201d that has not lived up to its TV or newspaper advertisement, you will agree that dissatisfied buyers are the worst kind of publicity for the product, the services or the deceitful company in general. And in addition ... Apart from all the above mentioned, it is important to remember the fact that in the midst of all this flood of advertisements in post boxes, on television, radio, and the Internet, people are becoming ever more selective. We simply overlook, we choose not to hear, or we turn off the advertisements. The advertisers have made the same conclusion, which is evident from television commercials where after they have been run there is another, more expensive one. The buyers\u2019 attention should be captivated by the form, as well as the content; the advertisement should awaken their interest and offer some kind of an advantage. This is the only way they will choose to dial your telephone number from the mass of advertisements.     Prosimo vas, da pri pisanju komentarjev niste \u017ealjivi.

      "text":" On the 4th of May 1980, the charismatic leader of SFRY, Josip Broz Tito, died in Ljubljana\u2019s Medical Centre. The event was widely reported on by domestic journalistic mediums, but...     On the 4th of May 1980, the charismatic leader of SFRY, Josip Broz Tito, died in Ljubljana\u2019s Medical Centre. The event was widely reported on by domestic journalistic mediums, but was also adorning covers internationally, from Der Spiegel to New York Times. Among the iconic photographs of Tito which were published alongside the articles, numerous were the work of Joco \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d, a master of photography and, quite coincidentally, Tito\u2019s designated photographer on his visits to Slovenia.     The career path of Joco \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d is just as interesting as the man himself. A former medical student, he began his photojournalistic path at the newspaper Tribuna, and continued at Tovari\u0161 and Delo. He was the first photographer who received the Pre\u0161eren Foundation award in 1977, including for his work as editor of photography at Delo. The same year, he became the first Slovene photographer to win the World Press Photo award for his dramatic sequence of photographs documenting the rescue of a horse on Triglav. His photographs are known to depict people through a profoundly sincere and humanizing lens. His camera was focused equally on gripping documentations of the Iran-Iraq war, the Corsica plane crash, the Slovenian War of Independence, as well as on portraits of the era\u2019s leading politicians. He was assigned the fascinating position of Tito\u2019s official photographer during his time at the daily newspaper Delo in the 1970s. By coincidence, his co-worker fell ill on the day of photographing Tito\u2019s arrival in Predoslje, and \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d\u2019s photographs of the event impressed the editorial office (and Tito) so much, he began taking shots of him everywhere.[1] He followed him all over the world, including on his famous visit to the Great Wall of China, Non-Aligned countries such as Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.[2]     Since the very conception of the medium of photography, leaders of great countries were usually accompanied by numerous photographers. It served the promotion of their governments ever since the 19th century, when queen Victoria issued a photographic album of carte-de-visite portraits which hit record sales in England.[3] Because of its specific nature of depicting \u201cthe objective\u201d, photography was a powerful medium for revealing the \u201ctruth\u201d. The latter was clearly easily manipulated with the right modes of orchestration but was still perceived as the most truthful in the eyes of the public. As was the case for all distinguished leaders of the time, Tito was well aware of photography\u2019s power. These types of images helped establish a cult of personality, which spread quickly amongst the people of Yugoslavia. It had a clear function of promoting ideology through images and gaining support of the people, who were able to identify with numerous representations of Tito \u2013 Tito with pets, children, observing exhibitions, nature, and even while relaxing with a glass of whiskey or a cigar. The series of images showing Tito photographing, however, is much less known.     The fascinating aspect of \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d\u2019s photographs is the fact that he captured moments other photographers haven\u2019t noticed, or perhaps haven\u2019t considered important. He never made official, rigid images of politicians, but preferred to present them as he did ordinary people, for example in his moving series of the impoverished people of Kozjansko. Thus, a number of photographs depicting Tito in unconventional scenarios was created. Among them, a series of presidential portraits focused on his relationship with the camera. Tito loved to take photos, which is visible for example in the photograph from Dra\u017ego\u0161e, where he is handing one of his polaroids to General Vidovi\u010d on the spot. In an interview, \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d told the newspaper Delo that Tito once commented on his camera, saying he owned a better one. He replied that this may be true, but he was a better photographer. A delicate statement was thankfully met with laughter from Tito\u2019s wife Jovanka.[4]     Beside its advertising function, Tito was also aware of photography\u2019s artistic potential. Republic exhibitions of photography were frequent and important events, which by themselves spoke volumes of the president\u2019s love of photography. Now for the first time, he is presented as a photographer himself. These photographs were not part of a narrative of propaganda, but instead show Yugoslavia\u2019s president engaged in a perhaps slightly unusual hobby. As Bogdan Poga\u010dnik wrote about \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d\u2019s photographs: ''Even though the collection shows \u2013 whether Tito is by himself or in the company of others \u2013 only one person, this presentation is never imbued with regime ideology or stylistically pathetic, but always gentle and democratic, simple and straightforward''.[5] In certain photographs, it seems as if \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d is photographing Tito and vice versa, while both are exuding joy behind the camera \u2013 one with a smile and camera in hand as subject of the image, the other as its passionate documentarist. Through the double lens of photographer and his subject, Joco \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d\u2019s photographs remind us of a fascinating man, an intriguing time in history and a universal love of photography.

Bacteria and viruses are mainly transmitted through the hands. When the door handle turns into a germ spreader, this is a problem for companies, especially in the hygiene sector. On many everyday things like smartphones, shopping carts, light switches or door handles adhere to the unwelcome bacteria firmly. For hospitals, doctors\u2019 surgeries, restaurants as well as the food processing industry the touchless switch is the perfect solution. Are the hands occupied with carrying shopping bags, anything else or by typing a message on the smartphone, the approach to the switch is enough and and the automatic door open.     In addition to the simple operation of the door, the record BLS 60 is hygienic to use, as at no time the skin comes into contact with the object.     For automatic doors that are only rarely opened, we provide this simple push-button switch.

The contactless IR hygienic button triggers an opening impulse without having to touch its surface.     Unlike the infrared sensors of the record 290 series, the detection field of this contactless switch is very small, so that it triggers only if a targeted movement occurs in its immediate vicinity. Inadvertent triggering is thus avoided, making the record contactless switch ideal for applications in hospitals, such as when entering the operating theatre after disinfecting the hands to perform surgical operations.     The record wireless button is a wireless 868.3 MHz radio-controlled button that can be attached to almost any point up to 30m from the door. Pushing the button transmits a radio signal with an embedded code to the receiving unit at the door control, triggering an opening impulse. Piezoelectric technology makes the record wireless button maintenance-free, and also means it does not require batteries. Included is also an adhesive film, which enables you to attach the radio-controlled button to glass, tiles or even painted walls. "

      "text":" Application Developer's Guide     Source Organization     Table of Contents     Directory Structure     The description below uses the variable name $CATALINA_BASE to refer the base directory against which most relative paths are resolved. If you have not configured Tomcat for multiple instances by setting a CATALINA_BASE directory, then $CATALINA_BASE will be set to the value of $CATALINA_HOME, the directory into which you have installed Tomcat.     A key recommendation of this manual is to separate the directory hierarchy containing your source code (described in this section) from the directory hierarchy containing your deployable application (described in the preceding section). Maintaining this separation has the following advantages:     The contents of the source directories can be more easily administered, moved, and backed up if the \"executable\" version of the application is not intermixed.     Source code control is easier to manage on directories that contain only source files.     The files that make up an installable distribution of your application are much easier to select when the deployment hierarchy is separate.     As we will see, the development tool makes the creation and processing of such directory hierarchies nearly painless.     The actual directory and file hierarchy used to contain the source code of an application can be pretty much anything you like. However, the following organization has proven to be quite generally applicable, and is expected by the example configuration file that is discussed below. All of these components exist under a top level project source directory for your application:     docs\/ - Documentation for your application, in whatever format your development team is using.     src\/ - Java source files that generate the servlets, beans, and other Java classes that are unique to your application. If your source code is organized in packages (highly recommended), the package hierarchy should be reflected as a directory structure underneath this directory.     web\/ - The static content of your web site (HTML pages, JSP pages, JavaScript files, CSS stylesheet files, and images) that will be accessible to application clients. This directory will be the document root of your web application, and any subdirectory structure found here will be reflected in the request URIs required to access those files.     web\/WEB-INF\/ - The special configuration files required for your application, including the web application deployment descriptor (, defined in the Servlet Specification), tag library descriptors for custom tag libraries you have created, and other resource files you wish to include within your web application. Even though this directory appears to be a subdirectory of your document root, the Servlet Specification prohibits serving the contents of this directory (or any file it contains) directly to a client request. Therefore, this is a good place to store configuration information that is sensitive (such as database connection usernames and passwords), but is required for your application to operate successfully.     During the development process, two additional directories will be created on a temporary basis:     build\/ - When you execute a default build (), this directory will contain an exact image of the files in the web application archive for this application. Tomcat allows you to deploy an application in an unpacked directory like this, either by copying it to the directory, or by installing it via the \"Manager\" web application. The latter approach is very useful during development, and will be illustrated below.     dist\/ - When you execute the target, this directory will be created. It will create an exact image of the binary distribution for your web application, including an license information, documentation, and README files that you have prepared.     Note that these two directories should NOT be archived in your source code control system, because they are deleted and recreated (from scratch) as needed during development. For that reason, you should not edit any source files in these directories if you want to maintain a permanent record of the changes, because the changes will be lost the next time that a build is performed.     External Dependencies     What do you do if your application requires JAR files (or other resources) from external projects or packages? A common example is that you need to include a JDBC driver in your web application, in order to operate.     Different developers take different approaches to this problem. Some will encourage checking a copy of the JAR files you depend on into the source code control archives for every application that requires those JAR files. However, this can cause significant management issues when you use the same JAR in many applications - particular when faced with a need to upgrade to a different version of that JAR file.     Therefore, this manual recommends that you NOT store a copy of the packages you depend on inside the source control archives of your applications. Instead, the external dependencies should be integrated as part of the process of building your application. In that way, you can always pick up the appropriate version of the JAR files from wherever your development system administrator has installed them, without having to worry about updating your application every time the version of the dependent JAR file is changed.     In the example Ant file, we will demonstrate how to define build properties that let you configure the locations of the files to be copied, without having to modify when these files change. The build properties used by a particular developer can be customized on a per-application basis, or defaulted to \"standard\" build properties stored in the developer's home directory.     In many cases, your development system administrator will have already installed the required JAR files into the directory of Tomcat. If this has been done, you need to take no actions at all - the example file automatically constructs a compile classpath that includes these files.     Source Code Control     As mentioned earlier, it is highly recommended that you place all of the source files that comprise your application under the management of a source code control system like the Concurrent Version System (CVS). If you elect to do this, every directory and file in the source hierarchy should be registered and saved -- but none of the generated files. If you register binary format files (such as images or JAR libraries), be sure to indicate this to your source code control system.     We recommended (in the previous section) that you should not store the contents of the and directories created by your development process in the source code control system. An easy way to tell CVS to ignore these directories is to create a file named (note the leading period) in your top-level source directory, with the following contents:     The reason for mentioning here will be explained in the Processes section.     Detailed instructions for your source code control environment are beyond the scope of this manual. However, the following steps are followed when using a command-line CVS client:     To refresh the state of your source code to that stored in the the source repository, go to your project source directory, and execute .     When you create a new subdirectory in the source code hierarchy, register it in CVS with a command like .     When you first create a new source code file, navigate to the directory that contains it, and register the new file with a command like .     If you no longer need a particular source code file, navigate to the containing directory and remove the file. Then, deregister it in CVS with a command like .     While you are creating, modifying, and deleting source files, changes are not yet reflected in the server repository. To save your changes in their current state, go to the project source directory and execute . You will be asked to write a brief description of the changes you have just completed, which will be stored with the new version of any updated source file.     CVS, like other source code control systems, has many additional features (such as the ability to tag the files that made up a particular release, and support for multiple development branches that can later be merged). See the links and references in the Introduction for more information.     BUILD.XML Configuration File     We will be using the ant tool to manage the compilation of our Java source code files, and creation of the deployment hierarchy. Ant operates under the control of a build file, normally called , that defines the processing steps required. This file is stored in the top-level directory of your source code hierarchy, and should be checked in to your source code control system.     Like a Makefile, the file provides several \"targets\" that support optional development activities (such as creating the associated Javadoc documentation, erasing the deployment home directory so you can build your project from scratch, or creating the web application archive file so you can distribute your application. A well-constructed file will contain internal documentation describing the targets that are designed for use by the developer, versus those targets used internally. To ask Ant to display the project documentation, change to the directory containing the file and type:     To give you a head start, a basic build.xml file is provided that you can customize and install in the project source directory for your application. This file includes comments that describe the various targets that can be executed. Briefly, the following targets are generally provided:     clean - This target deletes any existing and directories, so that they can be reconstructed from scratch. This allows you to guarantee that you have not made source code modifications that will result in problems at runtime due to not recompiling all affected classes.     compile - This target is used to compile any source code that has been changed since the last time compilation took place. The resulting class files are created in the subdirectory of your directory, exactly where the structure of a web application requires them to be. Because this command is executed so often during development, it is normally made the \"default\" target so that a simple command will execute it.     all - This target is a short cut for running the target, followed by the target. Thus, it guarantees that you will recompile the entire application, to ensure that you have not unknowingly introduced any incompatible changes.     javadoc - This target creates Javadoc API documentation for the Java classes in this web application. The example file assumes you want to include the API documentation with your app distribution, so it generates the docs in a subdirectory of the directory. Because you normally do not need to generate the Javadocs on every compilation, this target is usually a dependency of the target, but not of the target.     dist - This target creates a distribution directory for your application, including any required documentation, the Javadocs for your Java classes, and a web application archive (WAR) file that will be delivered to system administrators who wish to install your application. Because this target also depends on the target, the web application archive will have also picked up any external dependencies that were included at deployment time.     For interactive development and testing of your web application using Tomcat, the following additional targets are defined:     install - Tell the currently running Tomcat to make the application you are developing immediately available for execution and testing. This action does not require Tomcat to be restarted, but it is also not remembered after Tomcat is restarted the next time.     reload - Once the application is installed, you can continue to make changes and recompile using the target. Tomcat will automatically recognize changes made to JSP pages, but not to servlet or JavaBean classes - this command will tell Tomcat to restart the currently installed application so that such changes are recognized.     remove - When you have completed your development and testing activities, you can optionally tell Tomcat to remove this application from service.     Using the development and testing targets requires some additional one-time setup that is described on the next page.

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     GLTDF     GLTDF (Gross Loans to Deposits Flows ratio) is a macroprudential measure (introduced in June 2014, since Jan 2018 as a recommendation) meant to slow the decline in the banking system loan-to-deposit (hereinafter: LTD) ratio, stabilizing the banking system funding structure and mitigating systemic liquidity risk. Originally, the measure required banks gathering deposits and simultaneously contracting the lending to non-banking sector to increase the liquidity buffers. It therefore limits the impaired intermediation of financing to the non-banking sector (NBS).     In October 2017, the Governing Board of the Bank of Slovenia adopted the decision to introduce the GLTDF minimum requirement and the liquidity ratio requirement considering financial assets and liabilities with residual maturities up to 30 days, as the non-binding macroprudential recommendation that will become effective on 1 January 2018. Based on the evaluation of the GLTDF instrument and the beneficial developments of key indicators, like the stabilization of the loan-to-deposit ratio, it was assessed that the requirement can be transformed to non-binding recommendation. While preserving the instrument as the recommendation, emphasizing the predominance of demand deposits among customer deposits, it signals to the credit institutions the need for monitoring funding stability, prudent management of liquidity risk and gradual assets transformation.     Construction of the instrument     At the end of each quarter, banks with positive (annual) growth in non-banking sector (NBS) deposits are recommended to fulfil a non-negative (annual) GLTDF ratio:     In other words, banks with increasing NBS deposits are recommended not to reduce lending to the NBS. For the purpose of GLTDF, the gross loans are considered, that is the amount of loans before impairments (see the list of publications).     Main relevant historical changes     The measure was introduced in June 2014 as a macroprudential measure aiming to mitigate and prevent excessive maturity mismatch and illiquidity, which is also one of the intermediate macroprudential policy objectives set out by the Guidelines for the macroprudential policy of the Bank of Slovenia. Banks were initially required to meet over the period June 2014-March 2015. Contemporaneously, in June 2014, it was foreseen a deferred tightening of the measure, that would have required banks to meet and would have been effective on April 2015.     Initially, corrective measures were prescribed in event of failure to meet GLTDF-requirements. The corrective measures consisted in requiring banks to meet higher values of GLTDF ratio (i.e. 40% or 60%, depending on the initially required ratio) on quarterly basis when the quarterly increase in deposits by the NBS was positive.     In 2015 there was no tightening of the measure, though previously forseen. In 2016 the aforementioned corrective measure was relaxed to GLTDFq >= 0%. In October 2017 the measure has been converted into a recommendation.     Relevant regulation (the regulation available in English is listed in EN column) "

      "text":" Industry needs $700\/oz. gold to stay afloat- Barrick's Sokalsky     On average, gold producers will need the price of gold to stay north of $700\/oz if they are to turn a profit in the current environment of rising costs, Barrick Gold CFO Jamie Sokalsky said on Tuesday. Industry cash costs are currently around $450\/oz to $500\/oz and, taking into account the cost of bringing on new production, depreciation, development costs, exploration, administrative expenses and so on, \u201cthat's easily $700\/oz to $800\/oz\u201d, Sokalsky said in webcast presentation. \u201cTo us that's the long-term break-even cost to the industry...below $700\/oz to $800\/oz long term, the industry doesn't make money,\u201d he said. Gold prices were pushed skywards in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first few months of this year, largely by investment demand, as a weakening dollar, the US credit crisis, inflation concerns and geopolicital tensions and uncertainty raised the metal's attractiveness as a safe haven, or wealth-preservation investment. The price of gold set a new high of $1 033,70\/oz on March 17, but has since corrected and was trading at around $879\/oz on Tuesday afternoon. Barrick expects that the bullion prices have further to go this year, however, as dwindling mine supply and higher prices for fuel, labour and other costs would provide a \u201cstrong floor\u201d for the gold price, Sokalsky said. \u201cIt is also going to make some new projects that the industry has difficult to bring in and that's going to be very bullish for the gold price.\"     Barrick reported cash costs of $393\/oz for the first three months of this year, which, after realising an average gold price of $925\/oz, resulted in a margin of $532\/oz.     SUPPLY     Sokalsky said the Barrick, the world's biggest gold miner, expects mine supply of the yellow metal to continue to decline. \u201cI think we've seen the peak in mine supply a couple of years ago,\u201d he said. Total global gold production contracted 0,4% in 2007, to an eleven-year low, according to metals consultancy GFMS.     \u201cWe feel very strongly, and we've done a lot of analysis on this, that gold supply could drop 10% to 15% more than what forecasters are thinking in the next five to seven years,\u201d Sokalsky commented. Barrick chairperson and acting CEO Peter Munk said at the group's AGM last month that the failure of the gold-mining industry to find and exploit large new deposits of the yellow metal was \u201ctragic\u201d.     Opposition from nongovernmental organisations, as well as increasing, \"yet understandable\" demands from host countries that they receive a bigger share of profits from mines, was making it difficult to develop successful new operations, Munk said at the time.

He lived in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and was married to the painter Metka Kra\u0161ovec.[5]     Contents: 1 Life 2 Work 3 Poetry collections translated in English 4 International reception 4.1 America 4.2 Slovenia 5 Prizes 6 References 7 External links 7.1 Profiles 7.2 Work 7.3 Interviews and review 7.4 2011 Symposium Life[edit] As members of Slovene minority in Italy (1920\u20131947), \u0160alamun\u2019s mother\u2019s family joined thousands of Slovenes who left their homes because of the forced Italianization and moved from Italy to Yugoslavia, where he was born in 1941 in Zagreb. His father\u2019s family came from Ptuj, where his grandfather had been a mayor.[6] After his family moved to Koper, the local high school teachers of French language and Slovene language made him interested in language. In 1960, he began to study art history and history at University of Ljubljana. His mother was an art historian,[7] his brother Andra\u017e is an artist, while his two sisters are Jelka a biologist and Katarina a literary historian. \u0160alamun died on 27 December 2014 in Ljubljana.[8][9]     Work[edit] In 1964, as editor of a literary magazine Perspektive he published his iconoclastic poem \u201cDuma \u201964\u201d (Thought \u201964), which was one of the reasons why Perspektive was banned and \u0160alamun was arrested by Titoist regime because one of its hard-liners, Ivan Ma\u010dek Matija, recognized himself in the (dead) cat from the poem (the Slovene word ma\u010dek means \u2018cat\u2019).[7] He spent five days in jail and came out something of a culture hero, but he refrained from including the poem in his first poetry book, which appeared in 1966 in a samizdat edition, full of absurdist irreverence, playfulness, and wild abandon.[6][10]     Poetry collections translated in English[edit] \u0160alamun has had several collections of poetry published in English, including The Selected Poems of Toma\u017e \u0160alamun (Ecco Press, 1998); The Shepherd, the Hunter (Pedernal, 1992); The Four Questions of Melancholy (White Pine, 1997); Feast (Harcourt, 2000), Poker (Ugly Duckling Presse), Row! (Arc Publications, 2006), The Book for My Brother (Harcourt), Woods and Chalices (Harcourt, 2008, translated by Brian Henry), There\u2019s the Hand and There\u2019s the Arid Chair (Counterpath, 2009), and On the Tracks of Wild Game (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2012). American poets that influenced him include Frank O\u2019Hara, John Ashbery and Walt Whitman.[1]     International reception[edit] America[edit] In July 1970, he was personally invited to exhibit his work at the MOMA.[11] \u0160alamun spent two years at the University of Iowa, including one year in the International Writing Program from 1971 to 1972, and lived for periods of time in the United States after that.[3] From 2005 to 2007 he taught at the University of Pittsburgh.     Slovenia[edit] For a time, he served as Cultural Attach\u00e9 to the Consulate General of Slovenia in New York. Literary critic Miklav\u017e Komelj wrote:[12] \u201c\u0160alamun\u2019s inventiveness with language has, indeed, never been more dynamic than in his most recent books. But in this dynamism there is also a monotone quality, which the poet makes no attempt to hide. It is as if this ecstasy resulted from spinning endlessly in a circle, like the whirling dervishes\u2014a religious order, incidentally, that was founded by the mystic Rumi, one of \u0160alamun\u2019s favorite poets\u2026.It seems that the intensity of \u0160alamun\u2019s language lies precisely in the endless insistence of its pulsation.\u201d     Prizes[edit] \u0160alamun won a Pushcart Prize, as well as Slovenia\u2019s Pre\u0161eren Fund Award and Jenko Prize. \u0160alamun and his German translator, Fabjan Hafner, were awarded the European Prize for Poetry by the German city of Muenster. In 2004, he was the recipient of Romania\u2019s Ovid Festival Prize.[13] "

      "text":" Marina Trampus stirred the pot in Ljubljana last week! Not only did she win a grant from the American Embassy to engage an introductory Design Thinking workshop at Roska, but also managed high-profile appointments with the Ministry of Education and American Chamber of Commerce as well as presented the invigorating new ABC Accelerator at the Emporium. The time spent in Ljubljana was valuable to see that, even in deep snowy conditions, Slovenia is primed to reveal its 21st Century innovative self.     prof. Marina Trampus     Good afternoon, from my side, to the Speakers, to the US Embassy in Slovenia and to the Guests!     As Taja Zuccato, journalist, former student of SE\u0160 Ljubljana, already announced me, I have been teaching at this school for many years in the field of economics and entrepreneurship. I still had many nice memories, ... there were a lot of innovative ideas, creative school hours and entrepreneurial students.     For the first time, I met for a phrase design thinking, at the Faculty of Economics in Ljubljana, with professor Ale\u0161 Vah?i? .     ... Design thinking was something completely new to us at that time!     Design thinking - this technique - enables people to solve complex problems in a creative and innovative way - a useful method for life, work, ...     I would point out the CREATIVE CONFINEDCE, the book - TOM KELLEY AND DAVID KELLEY, which, I can say, changed my life.     This book will take the place, a special task in the Slovene territory. The book is going to trevel from one person to another. Every person is going to mark the page which find it the most interested. When she\/he will finsh the reading, will give the book to another person. PAY IT FORWARD.     Thank you to everyone, who invests in positive changes.     On behalf of the Fundation Tramp located in Ljubljana, Slovenia I would like to express our interest in collaborating with organization\/schools as well as to suggest partnership in project proposals you might have under the Erasmus + Programme.

We are ready to provide any additional help or information related to our activities.     If we want to make creativity and innovation has become an important part of the learning process we the need to find approaches that promote and encourage the students to be in school more can reflect innovative.

Our headquarters is in capital city Ljubljana, and there are 71 local units spread across all country.     ZSKSS is a member of WAGGGS (World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts).     The primary purpose of the Association is to contribute to the full physical, mental, spiritual and social development of young people so that they can become people of strong character, responsible citizens and members of local, national and international communities. We have the status of an association of public interest in the field of education and the status of a national youth organization.

      "text":" The Challenge     4 men, three British and one Slovenian, are taking on the Atlantic in the row of their lives to complete the 2,500 nautical mile rowing challenge from the Canary Islands to Barbados, starting in January 2012.     Ocean crossings are few and far between. Indeed more people by far have reached the summit of Mt. Everest and have been into space than have rowed across one of the Earth\u2019s oceans. From 462 recorded port departures, 293 crews have successfully crossed an ocean. The Atlantic Ocean tests the human body to its very limits. Sleep deprivation, salt sores, and the physical extremes that the row will inflict merely scratch the surface of the issues affecting the crew.     We are setting out to achieve our dream and in doing so we are showing others they can achieve theirs. We want to raise money for our chosen charities and, at the same time, inspire, engage, and motivate Slovenian and British people not to let fear or doubt limit their potential.     The boat we will be using for the crossing, the Tu\u0161mobil, has a perfect ocean rowing record. She crossed the North Atlantic route (New York-Isles of Scilly) in 2006 and the Trade winds route (Canaries-Barbados) in 2008. She is 8.8m long and 1.8m at her widest. The boat is designed to be self-righting, meaning that the she can capsize without danger of staying in the upturned position. There are two tiny cabins that we will call home sweet home.     crew     Marin Medak     Marin is finishing his studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Ljubljana, Slovenia. He first sat in a kayak at the tender age of 21 and since then hasn\u2019t stopped paddling. In 2009 he did a solo trip around the Dalmatian coast of Croatia, and in the summer of 2010 he completed a solo expedition from Slovenia to the Greek island of Zakynthos, paddling around 800 nautical miles in one month, and in March 2011, together with Simon Osborne, they become the first people to kayak the coast of South Korea. They covered approximately 1100 km in 23 days. Marin started rowing in 2010 and is keen to embrace the new Atlantic Challenge.     Simon Osborne     Simon is an international teacher and assessor of sea kayaking and holds the highest recognised qualification in the sport in the world. He runs a business in England teaching people from all over the world how to sea kayak. In 2002 he became the youngest person to circumnavigate Great Britain and still holds this title. He circumnavigated Ireland two years later and in 2007 he attempted to circumnavigate Madagascar in a sea kayak. In March 2011 he partnered with Marin to kayak the whole of South Korea\u2019s coast. During these expeditions he raised more than \u00a340,000 for the Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research in memory of his brother Mark.     Stephen Bowens     Steve was born and grew up in Northern Ireland before working all over the world coaching windsurfing, kayaking, and various outdoor sports. He is now 35 and a Lecturer in Marine Sports Science at Falmouth Marine School (Cornwall College), where he also runs instructor training courses. Steve has represented England in surf kayaking at the world championships in 2007 and also in several European Championships. He is fanatical about windsurfing and also loves to surf, climb, and mountain bike. He can often be seen at the beach with his dog Tillie who goes everywhere with him in the van (alas Tillie will have to be fostered for the duration of the expedition).     Alastair Humphreys     Al is a seasoned adventurer. He cycled around the world, ran the Marathon des Sables, raced a yacht across the Atlantic Ocean, canoed 500 miles down the Yukon River, rowed to France with Major Phil Packer, a soldier paralysed in Iraq, walked the length of the holy Kaveri river in India, completed an unsupported crossing of Iceland by foot and packraft, and much more.     He also published 4 books and he is a great motivator that changes peoples life through adventure. "

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Summary of macroeconomic developments, November 2018     Indicators of global economic activity suggest a continuation of solid growth in the final quarter of this year, but the outlook is continuing to deteriorate. The international trade situation is continuing to worsen. The financing conditions are also deteriorating, particularly for certain developing countries. Economic growth in the euro area slowed significantly in the third quarter, and the slowdown is thought to have continued in October and November, at least according to PMI indicators. In addition to global factors, risks to ongoing growth in the euro area are also being increased by the uncertainty connected with Italy\u2019s fiscal plans, and by Brexit. The November weighted forecast for this year's economic growth for Slovenia's trading partners is also lower. The euro exchange rate against the US dollar is continuing to slide. By November 23, the euro fell to USD 1.14, down 4.2% in year-on-year terms. Oil prices are continuing to fall, contrary to the expectations when sanctions were introduced against Iran. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has fallen by over a quarter since the beginning of October, and reached USD 62 by 22 November, the lowest figure since March of this year.     Growth in the Slovenian economy remained relatively high in the third quarter, albeit with a sharp slowdown in the export sector in September. Growth in industrial production and exports was robust over the summer, and was not yet reflecting the decline in the estimated strength of foreign demand indicated by surveys of manufacturing firms. A fall followed in September with year-on-year growth in industrial production declining to just 0.5%, while nominal year-on-year growth in goods exports declined to 0.8% according to balance of payments figures. The structure of both trajectories indicates that there was a decline in numerous segments of manufacturing, most notably in those related to the car industry. The latter is connected with weaker demand for cars in the EU and also in China. The rise in firms\u2019 export expectations in October and November suggests that the rest of the year will be more favourable. However, signals of the strength of domestic demand were not unidirectional in the third quarter. After a rather weak August, nominal growth in imports increased in September, but only as a result of the high contribution made by imports of oil and gas, where price rises had a major impact on the absolute value. Growth in construction activity and turnover in services related to construction remained high, in line with expectations. Demand on the domestic market was strengthened by a good holiday season. According to survey indicators, the final quarter will be favourable as confidence increased among firms and consumers alike after September.     Firms are reporting labour shortages, but employment growth remains high, while real growth in the net average wage is declining. Year-on-year growth in the workforce in employment excluding self-employed farmers stood at 3% in the third quarter, comparable to the second quarter. According to SORS survey figures, growth will remain high at least until the end of the year, particularly in retail and construction. Unemployment stood at 76,232 in October, down more than 8% in year-on-year terms. Although unemployment is continuing to fall, year-on-year real growth in the average net wage is also declining. According to monthly figures, the rate stood at 1.6% in the first quarter, but had declined to just 0.4% by the third quarter. Similar trends are also evident in real growth in the net wage bill. These developments are thought to be temporary in nature. Should they persist, the outlook for growth in private consumption would worsen in the context of the increased household saving rate.     Inflation as measured by the HICP rose again in October. The year-on-year rate stood at 2.3%, comparable to the euro area average. The rise was largely attributable to external factors. Rises in energy prices accounted for almost half of inflation. Growth in prices of unprocessed food increased to 4.7%, which is 2.6 percentage points above the euro area average. Growth in prices in these two categories contributed 1.4 percentage points towards October\u2019s inflation rate.     Year-on-year growth in services prices slowed slightly relative to the previous month, but remained higher than the euro area average. By contrast, prices of other goods in Slovenia are continuing to fall, while the corresponding prices in the euro area overall have been rising for more than three years now, albeit at low rates of around 0.4%. The differences in the dynamics of services prices and prices of other goods thus remain the main factor in the differing structure of inflation in Slovenia and in the euro area overall.     The consolidated general government surplus increased over the first nine months of the year as a result of high economic growth, the net disbursement of EU funds, and the diminishing burden of interest payments. The government and the European Commission are forecasting a general government surplus of 0.5% of GDP for this year. The government is drafting a budget rebalancing for next year, where the largest risks relate to controlling growth in expenditure. Given the currently favourable economic conditions, sufficient fiscal surpluses should be created to reduce relatively high levels of debt and timely structural reforms adopted to ensure long-term fiscal stability. This would create space for the fiscal policy to possibly act countercyclically and mitigate future demographic pressures. "

The relationship between the letter and the line, the word and the image, the narrative and the visuals is part of many contemporary art projects.     Selected artistic projects and works are each very distinct and different, but all together present a comprehensive process of engaging with words, texts, books, literature and the ritual of reading on the one hand, and the city and urban landscapes on the other. The city and the book are presented in two roles: as a theme connecting all the projects, and as a background to the installation.

      "text":" Zero integrity in Slovenian politics     Torek, 15 Januar 2013 14:01     Thousands of Slovenians have been taking to the streets to protest corruption. At the time of high public distrust in politics and rule of law, scandal is pouring oil on the fire. While people are protesting in the streets against corrupt politics, Slovenia\u2019s leaders seem to still think that corruption risks can be tolerated.     Slovenia\u2019s Prime Minister, Janez Jan\u0161a, and the head of the opposition and Mayor of Ljubljana, Zoran Jankovi\u0107, have been hit by the latest report from the anti-corruption commission on disclosure of assets in year-long investigation of the highest political officials presented a number of violations of financial disclosures obligations.     In the case of Prime Minister Jan\u0161a, the anti-corruption body\u2019s investigations uncovered private expenses and use of fund in the amount of at least \u20ac200.000 from unknown origins that exceed his official income and savings.     In case of Mayor Jankovi\u0107, the investigation uncovered a systemic failure to report his full assets \u2013 \u20ac2.4 million, and his transactions with the shares of different companies. Several financial chains between companies owned by the Mayor\u2019s sons and companies doing mutli-million businesses with the city were uncovered. Part of these funds were transferred to a private account of the Mayor, according to the report.     Jan\u0161a and Jankovi\u010d rejected allegations and presented their story in the media. The report and the findings in their eyes represents conspiracy and political attempts to discredit them.     The response of the Prime minister and the Mayor was expected and in accordance with the low ethical culture in Slovenian politics \u2013 politicising, half-truths, pressures and discretisation of findings and the work of the independent anti-corruption body.     Both sought the shelter of their parties in search for support, as if the members of the parties were the one who elected them. This represents ignorance towards ethical norms and even widens it to the bigger circle of politics. Both easily passed votes of confidence, and 2 days later Mayor Jankovi\u0107 froze his presidency of the party.     Meanwhile, President Jan\u0161a launched political counter-attack. It is obvious that unlike the practice in some parts of the world, where political power-holders immediately resign from office at the time of the occurrence of a suspected violation of law or immoral and unethical acts, in Slovenia politicians and officials shift responsibility for their actions elsewhere.     Outraged by the level of integrity of high politicians in Slovenia, Integriteta \u2013 Transparency International Slovenia issued a press release expecting both actors take responsibility for their unethical and illegal actions. We will also call for changes in the laws on disclosure of assets, since only Slovenia and France among 27 EU countries do not fully allow public disclosure of assets.     High public officials should be aware of what trust of the society means for his own integrity, its public function and that any risk of corruption leads to the creation of a double standard.     The question is, when will politicians realize that the success of the country in economic, social and other areas firstly lies in the confidence of the people? This confidence is based on high ethical and moral standards, integrity, transparency and accountability.     The \u201cModus operandi\u201d of politicians has to change.

      "text":" Kromberk Castle, only a few kilometres away from Nova Gorica, is the central exhibition space of the Regional Museum Gori\u0161ki muzej and is also a place for gathering, socializing and learning new things. The ground floor and first floor contain the permanent exhibitions on art history and cultural history. The second floor is used for periodic exhibitions, lectures, symposia and other activities. The castle is surrounded by a beautiful park with an amphitheatre and an outdoor lapidarium.     History     In the area mentioned as Stran in the beginning of the 13th century, Count Henrik of Dornberk built the original castle in the first half of the 13th century. It was the fief of the Counts of Gorizia until their line died out in 1500; afterwards, the entire area came under Habsburg rule. As the 16th century was drawing to a close, Ciprijan I Coronini obtained a large estate within the village. His family had come to Gorizia at the end of the 16th century from Berbenno near Bergamo. In 1609, Ga\u0161per Vid of Dornberk sold the other part of the estate to Ciprijan's grandson, Ivan Filip Coronini. On 4 December 1615, Emperor Ferdinand II bestowed the noble title of von Cronberg on him and his cousin Janez Andrej Coronini, along with judicial power over the village of Stran and the permission to rename the village Crannperg. Ivan Marija Coronini then began building a new castle, named Neu Cronberg. Construction was most likely finished by his son Ludvik Pompej. In 1634, the Coronini family became barons of the state and in 1681 dukes of the state. For some time, Kromberk Castle was the central residence of the Gorizia branch of the Coronini family. In 1820, the Coronini family bought the Zingraf Palace from the Strassoldo family (the present-day Coronini Palace in Gorizia) and began using the castle in Kromberk as a summer residence.     During World War I (in 1916), the castle burnt down and both north towers were demolished. The library and archives of the Coronini, Rabatta and Cobenzl families were salvaged and moved to Gorizia. In 1936, Viljem Coronini, the last count of the Gorizia branch of the Coronini family, began reconstructing the castle. He brought missing equipment from his other estates and also added a half-storey to the building. During World War II, after Italy had capitulated in 1943 and the partisans unsuccessfully attempted to conquer the town of Gorizia before the Germans could, the castle was burnt down again. The count managed to save only 5 pieces of furniture and a few pictures and books from the castle. After the war, Vilijem Coronini began renovating, this time with the help of the Allied Military Government Office and the Italian Commission for Cultural Heritage in Trieste. After the Paris Peace Conference, the entire area was given to Yugoslavia. Since 1954, the castle has been housing the Regional Museum Gori\u0161ki muzej. The museum began numerous stages of extensive renovation works that returned the castle to its original splendour. The northwest and northeast towers were built in 1963 and 1978, respectively. As the Seventies came to an end, earthquake damage restoration was begun and the interior was renovated according to the ideas of architect Janez Suhadolc.     The building with its corner towers gives the impression of a castle, while in truth the entire complex was designed to be a mansion or villa. The ground plan of the building was partially designed in the Venetian style. The inner staircase, situated in the south part of the castle, led to the piano nobile which contained a large saloon. This central part of the castle was changed after the inter-war restoration had been completed and the castle had been added a half-storey. Located in the southeast part of the ground floor was the castle chapel for counts and villagers, which was consecrated for the second time in the beginning of the 19th century during the placement of a large altar painting by Franc Kav\u010di\u010d, depicting the assumption of the Virgin. It was larger than the altar space and had to be suspended as a ceiling panel painting. It was greatly damaged during World War I; today, only two fragments of the painting are preserved. One hangs in the wedding chamber of Kromberk Castle while the other, slightly larger, is in the Coronini Palace in Gorizia.     In addition to the residential building, there was an outbuilding, stables and a park. The outer walls were most likely never used for defence but rather merely enveloped the estate, thus protecting the owner's privacy. The main entrance was most likely located on the north side. The path that led to the entrance passed through the walls and a smaller park.

      "text":" umetnik, academician, Hon.Dr of L. \u2013 artist, academician, Honorary Doctorate of Letters, Honorary Master of Arts     II. FACE OF THE SOUL \u2013 Good and Evil     Maksim Sedej ml.: Kompozicija VII, olje na platnu 130\u00d7130 cm 1964 Maksim Sedej yr.: Composition VII, oil on canvas 130\u00d7130 cm 1964     The River in the City was diverted through a deep concrete channel so that its watery flow was almost invisible. In spring when the snow melted in distant hills or after a strong spell of autumn showers, it filled its bed to almost the halfway mark and soundlessly rushed through the City. Uprooted trees and broken branches floated on it like a fleet of ships after a lost battle. The smooth concrete walls of the vertical banks prevented the trees and branches from getting caught and disturbing the flow of the water so there was very little sound as the river passed through. In summer and winter, the shallow water crept slowly, hardly perceptibly, along the bottom of the river bed.     The high city houses were separated from the water by a narrow gap and protected with a concrete barrier.     The gap almost had the status of a town street though in places it was so narrow that terraces, hanging like balconies over the water, had been constructed above the river. These terraces or balconies provided the best vantage point for the events that took place on the River. The river bottom was reinforced with large square cobblestones. Scarce river moss grew in the crevices where the stones met, lending the water a greenish nuance. The River gently curved and the cobblestones ended just under the balcony beneath our house. From that point on, the River flowed along a smooth concrete bottom. On the opposite bank about ammeter above the River\u2019s surface, there was a big oval culvert and a stream of water gushed out of it. The stream came from channels far beneath the City and its force was great enough to push the calm waters away from the curve of the river, creating a sandbank under the balcony where thick moss grew. When the river was shallow, alittie mossy island a few meters long jutted up above the surface. At the end of the little island, I could just make out the beginning of the concrete bottom where the water got a little deeper. Long mossy fronds undulated on the surface making a green roof, an ideal hiding place for the fish that darted up from the smooth concrete bottom. I had to be extremely cautious if I wanted to surprise the fish. As soon as I climbed the concrete barrier, the fish had already spotted me and fled in panic. The smaller ones hid beneath the moss and the larger ones disap\u00adpeared down toward the riverbed into deeper water. Sometimes a big one would hide beneath the mossy fronds, giving me the opportunity to catch it with my hands. Not far from the island, iron ladders led down to the water\u2019s surface.     ln those days, an uneasy silence prevailed over the City. Only the creaking wheels of military vehicles or farmer\u2019s carriages broke the silence, by the clip-clopping of the hooves of tired horses that could barely keep their balance on the granite paving stones of the City\u2019s main thoroughfare. The road led down from the distance hills and, along it, columns of defeated armies and fright\u00aden ed people, heads bent low, slowly made their way through the City. This nearly silent, slithering procession of human despair was interrupted only occasionally by the wail of a baby which al so soon subsided.     I didn\u2019t see any fish when I looked down into the water. I glanced quickly up and down the River and it seemed to me that something had moved or that someone was watching me. A curtain on a window on the other side of the River swayed slightly. There was never any sign of life behind that window in the deserted house except when something extraordinary happened in the City. I had a feeling that something was terribly wrong with the fish so I climbed up on to the concrete wall and looked underneath the balcony.     Something seized me violently in my chest. It was the same as the time I heard about the poet\u2019s death. A little girl was Iying on her back on the mossy green island. In an instant, I took in every detail of her. She wore a silk blouse with patterned ribbons, she had a colorful neckerchief with little Eiffel Towers printed on it. She had on a pretty dark brown velvet skirt. Ught gray daisies were carefully woven into her white socks woven from the finest thread. On her feet were patent leather shoes with thin straps and big silver buckles. And her hair had been braided in two beautiful plaits and tied together with a great red ribbon which had sunk into the moss. Yet I couldn\u2019t have made out all those details so quickly from where I hid under the balcony; the picture of the girl was already inside of me.     Maksim Sedej ml.: O dobrem in zlu variacija, XII, tempera na platnu, 120\u00d7120 cm, 1967     I remember well the day I first saw her. It had been a religious holiday. There had been staIIs filled with the most wonderful things all around the church and in the square in front of it. The bells had chimed cheerfully and had boomed solemnly. And the crowd milling around the staIIs had poured into the church and into the pubs and then returned to the square again. I watched the flowing crowd from behind a decorated bush at the lower end of the square. There was no good reason for observing the milling circling crowd for such a long time but something held me back so I remained in my post. Then I saw her. She was wearing the very same clothes. She fluttered towards me like a butterfly, vanished in the crowd, then\u2019 appeared and vanished again. She was like one of the big brown peacock butterflies flying and playing among the rare plants in the deserted monastery garden that I could watch for hours and hours. Her beautiful appearance overwhelmed me so much that I wanted to see her from up close. I slipped into the crowd and it carried me away; I began to flow with the river of people. It was impossible to find anyone in that crowd. When I had given up any idea of finding her again and only wanted to corkscrew my way back to freedom, she suddenly appeared right in front of me. Her presence confused me so much that I blushed. Only then did I notice that the girl was holding the hand of a tall pretty lady who looked an awful lot like my own mother. The two laid eyes on me at once; they must have seen me standing behind the bush, secretly watching the festive movement of the people. The pretty lady asked me what my name was and if I wanted to have my photo taken together with the girl. I couldn\u2019t rid myself of an awkward feeling of embarrassment so I simply nod dad and kept my eyes fixed to the ground. It was then that I noticed the pretty grayish daisies woven into her white socks and the big silver buckles on her patent leather shoes. The beautiful lady left us alone for a moment; the girl took my hand and gently squeezed it. The lady brought a big Easter bundle decorated with fancy ribbons, candies and a wonderful bright red orange. She led us to a place in front of the church stairs which were empty right then. She placed the bundle into my hands and stood the girl beside me. She took a camera from her handbag and took a few pictures. When I heard the snapping of the camera, my timidity vanished as quickly as it had appeared. I looked the girl in her eyes and saw the azure sky reflected in them. Right in that instant, a raging man wearing the uniform of a foreign officer rushed between us. He said some harsh words in a foreign language, grabbed the beautiful lady\u2019s hand and pulled her towards a car waiting at the edge of the square. The girl began to cry and ran after them. But she stopped in front of the car, turned back to me and waved her hand. The big black car disappeared and the reflection of the azure sky with it. Without giving a second thought to the delicious orange, I gave the whole bundle they had left behind to Franci who had observed the whole thing and shrewdly detected my stunned bewilderment.     For a long time after that incident, I used to wander around the square and the church, waiting for her to appear. But she never did. Never again. One day I received a letter with the photo taken by the pretty lady. On the back of the picture, she had written that they both sent their warmest regards and hoped there would soon be another holiday.     I don\u2019t know how long I numbly stared at the stiffened girl before I felt them: the presence of all those strange inhabitants of the old town houses, the lofts and the cellars. I have no idea where they came from. But they smelled a disaster; they felt it. A certain agitation seized them and they came to the precise place where evil! had occurred. Thus they saw everything; they knew every\u00adthing. They see med to take no interest in the procession of death that wended its way through the town \u2013 but that was only the appearance they gave. For anything thrown away or left beside the roadside by the fleeing columns disappeared overnight. Everything, included deserted cannons. They shoved me away from the fence when they came. A big crowd gathered: from children to toothless old people who could only wag their fingers and point at the sky. I had only begun to notice such people when we moved to this part of town. I saw them in the morning, at the begin\u00adning of day. Dawn is special in the old part of the City. The narrow streets are still dark, illuminated only by dim street lamps and the sky glows an extraordinary sea blue above the rooftops. But when the sun actually rises, everything \u2013 sky, lanes, and houses \u2013 becomes gray. once the foreign soldiers, guns tipped with bayonets, had gathered a group of people at the crossroads near the former penitentiary. There was plenty of space there. They herded us together over the course of several hours. It was freezing cold and we all stamped our feet and waited, uncertain what would happen to us. Nobody knew why we had been crowded into that place. But I was filled with surprised when I looked at the strange people around me. I never saw the majority of them again. I got goose bumps when I realized that most of them would simply squeeze into some narrow space where they would wither away. The Houses in the City weren\u2019t attached and there was a good meter gap between them. These gaps were walled up on the street side and they faded into the grayness of the city streets. Many people lived in those gaps. Perhaps that\u2019s why some of them seemed so flat to me: some seemed oddly pointed and others barely reached the height of five feet. Some had heads covered with thin wispy hair. While I gazed at them in aston\u00adishment, my father poked me and whispered that the soldiers were looking for criminals. It was then that I really noticed how odd my father, mother and two brothers looked in that crowd. The soldiers had dragged us from the bed where we all warmed ourselves in the cold winter season when we didn\u2019t have enough fuel. We wore nightgowns that were a little too big for us and my father had pajamas made from the same flowery patterned cloth. My mother had sewn these night clothes for us and we looked like a big bunch of daisies in the middle of winter. The next day the carpenter kindly told my mother this funny metaphor but at the time we just huddled together and shivered with cold.     Suddenly the crowd roared and rushed. A short chubby man had spotted a figure high on a roof behind a chimney and yelled, \u201cThe band it is up there! Look!\u201d The crowd swelled with excite\u00adment and the soldier pressed the onlookers against the walls with their bayonets. Then the crowd cal med down and the soldiers broke into the nearby houses and soon appeared on the roof of the house where the man was hiding behind the chimney.     There were the sound of two ban gs on the roofs and then shards of roof tiles fell to the street. Everything became quiet. After the passage of a few minutes that seemed as long as eternity, the entrance door opened and the soldiers pushed out a man bound with barbed wire. He was cov\u00adered with blood so his face could neither be seen or recognized. \u201cKill the bandit!\u201d a littie man yelled, spitting in the direction of the bloodied man. The soldier who was guarding the crowd approached the little man, pushed him aside and growled at him in a harsh voice. Later my father told me that the soldier had disgraced the little man. He said that to wish such a thing on a fellow citizen is doubly brutal.     The criminal was dragged away. The crowd dispersed into the narrow lanes and vanished. I noticed that something had fallen from the bleeding man. I was the only one who noticed it. When everybody was gone, I went back and picked up the things. They were two steel teeth and a white piece of bone.     I knew that even my mother would not be able to help the dead girl so I went to the deserted monastery garden. My mother was usually able to calm me, to make the worst things bearable. I always tried to avoid\u2019 her when I had been naughty but it never worked out. She could read my mind. Often when I believed that some infraction had been long forgotten, she sat me down at the table and told me calmly and kindly how I must behave the next time. Sometimes I wished she would just slap my face. I\u2019d be offended, I\u2019d feel punished but at least the sin would be paid for. But she never slapped me!     The deserted monastery garden was my own secret place that nobody else knew about. A high wall that did not pose a serious obstacle for me surrounded the garden. I climbed to the top of it on a beech tree and then stepped to a wonderful tree that grew within the garden, close to the wall. It had beautiful bluish-red flowers that looked like tulips; that\u2019s why it was sometimes called a tulip tree. It looked magnificent in the spring time when it was covered with clusters of blossoms. The tree had wide branches so it wasn\u2019t difficult at all descending to the garden. The garden itself was thickly overgrown with rare grasses and plants that could be found nowhere else that I knew of. And huge trees grew among them. Plane trees. For me, the most mysterious part of the garden were the stairs leading down to a semi-circular opening that was covered by a thick iron grid.     Sometimes I peeked through the grid and my eyes traveled along corridors that disappeared into the darkness. The dim sounds I could make out within, like the dripping of water from the walls, made the place seem even more mysterious. Sometimes I sat on a thick branch and watched the bugs and butterflies flying over the grass. One day I al most fell off the branch because I saw something black slipping through the grid and slowly crawling up the stairs. But I wasn\u2019t fright\u00adened for long. The black apparition wasn\u2019t big and it looked quite a bit like an ordinary cat. I carefully approached and surprised the animal. When it saw me it turned, horrified, and ran back down the stairs and through the grid. I ran after it and just managed to see what was wrong with it. It was a cat. Its back legs were lame and it only moved its front paws as it rushed down the stairs, dragging its body and lame rear paws behind it. It had a littie long hairy stump instead of a tail. From that day on, I always brought the cat leftovers from our means. The first day I brought the food, I waited impatiently for the poor little animal to appear but it never did. The next day, howev\u00ader, the food was gone. This went on through the spring. The lame animal obviously ate at night and I soon lost any hope of seeing it again. One day when I was putting the food in the usual place, I sensed a black shape in the darkness of the grid. I hid behind a huge plane tree and waited. After a couple of hours, I finally gave up. As I climbed up the \u2018tree on the wall, I glanced back toward the garden. From behind the last stair, I saw the little black head of the cat watching me. We looked at each other for a long time and then the cat seized the food and disappeared. From then on it was always like that. I put the food on the top stair, climbed the tree, and waited a moment or two for the little black head to appear. The cat and I looked at each other for some time, then he grasped the food and crawled down to the grid and disappeared into the blackness of the hole. I found a certain satisfaction in this relationship. The idea of caressing his silky fur and his lame little body actually filled me with slight horror. I knew if the lame cat was found byanyone else, they would kill it. It would be do ne in secret and I would never know who did it. That was how Death\u2019 was in the City. At certain times, its deeds were revealed in all their terror and then the presence of Death retreated once again into silence and mystery.     But there was one time when I surprised death. The mysterious deserted house opposite \u201cmy\u201d balcony drew my attention, making me wonder: just what was going on down by the River. I decid\u00aded to explore. But I found it impossible to break into the house. lron crosses protected the cellar     windows; the windows on the ground floor had been covered over with planks, firmly nailed down. All the entrances from neighboring houses were walled up. The roof seemed impenetrable too, everything battened down with thick planks. The massive front door was locked with a special lock. Miro, the shoemaker, solved the problem for me. When I my confided my wish to him, he seemed upset at first but then his face cleared. \u201cThere is a locksmith who owes me a favor so 1\u201911 be able to give you some very special keys. If you\u2019re caught, toss them in the river so that the fellow who lends me the keys won\u2019t be wrongly accused of the crime. And once you\u2019re in the house, you mustn\u2019t touch or take anything. lam actually very interested in it myself. Perhaps it\u2019s under a spell. And remember, you don\u2019t know me.\u201d     I waited for curfew and sneaked out. It was already dark and the sky above the City had be\u00adcome a deep blue. It was almost too easy. I unlocked the door with my second attempt. I carefully closed the door behind me and cautiously peeked around the obscures place. At the top of the staircase, I saw a window covered with a dusty curtain. I moved it aside and beheld the most beautiful scene. The City was drowning in the dark blue sea of the sky; the windows glowed in the scarlet of the sunset; purple light filled the streets. \u201cMy\u201d balcony on the other side of the River was right before me. It was swarming with soldiers in greenish uniforms. They climbed on the fence along si de the River. They were running along the bank, waving their arms and guns, shouting. So I looked down into the River and saw. At first I didn\u2019t understand what I was seeing but then I realized with terror that there were corpses in the river. Two or three tied together, blown up like balloons, floating down the river. The bound clusters collided with one another, bumping each other aside, hitting the slippery bank where they turned and continued floating down the river with their heads or feet first. I stili remember how frightened I was when I ran home. The next day I heard that some time ago, people had been killed in the woods, tied with barbed wire, weighted down with stones and thrown into the river. When they finally came up, their bodies were bloated like balloons and thus they floated down on the surface of the water.     The war ended a few days after the little girl\u2019s death. Her death must have been somehow connected with the end of the war. Foreign armies fled. and other foreign armies came. They spoke astrange language too but it was easier to understand. The policemen remained more or less the same. The same policeman who had pursued me in vain for fishing during the war now threatened me with a gun. From then on I went fishing in the big culvert that meandered under the City. If by some strange chance an elephant were to get lost in that labyrinth, it would never be found. That autumn when beautiful red leaves fell from the huge maple in Town Square, my moth\u00ader was waiting for me in the front of our door. She held in her hands a basket covered with a napkin and something stirred beneath the napkin. My mothers hair practically stood on end be\u00adcause she was afraid of animals but, despite that, she pulled the cloth aside and revealed a beautiful little black cat in the basket. I thanked her politely but already sensed what had hap\u00adpened which she must have already known. Without even looking at the animal in the basket, I rushed to the secret monastery garden.     All over the City buildings were being pulled down and new ones were being built. The monas\u00adtery and its garden were among the first to go. They pulled down a part of the wall, dug up the garden and made a big hole in the wall on the opposite side of the garden. Then they continued to dig. They laid hollow concrete pipes. There was a giant heap of spare pipes in the garden and that was where the workers ate lunch every day. The cat discovered this and ate the crumbs they left behind every day. One day they returned unexpectedly and surprised the cat. Frightened, it scrambled into one of the pipes. The workers stood at the pipe\u2019s two ends to prevent the cat from escaping. A member of the group tore a large branch off a plane and thrust it into the pipe. The cat jumped out in panic. They killed it with the granite blocks they used to support the pipes in the ditch.     I can\u2019t say that I was surprised when I rushed to the monastery garden and saw the little lump of red flesh and black fur because I\u2019d been expecting something like this for some time. Every\u00adthing had pointed in that direction. The workers\u2019 behavior hadn\u2019t augured well. They had devastat\u00aded the garden, broken and uprooted the beautiful flowering bushes and the smaller trees for no reason. They had stomped over plants and flowers and desecrated\u201d every comer of the garden so that instead of with flowers it was sprinkled with tom and dirty pieces of paper printed with black letters and red stars. With their heavy boots, they crushed the stone edges of the stairs carved in the Baroque era. They ripped off the grids protecting the entrance and broke the water pipe so that the water streamed into that infinitely mysterious interior. The smell of decay already floated above the place.     I was terribly angry, filled with indignation. Everyday I went and sat on the monastery wall. I systematically studied the workers\u2019 habits hoping to think up some cruel revenge. Then one day the following story played out. The workers were drinking the contents of a bottle of brandy some\u00adone had \u201cforgotten\u201d on the pipes. Afterwards they went, shouting and roaring with laughter, to a pub to continue drinking. In the pub, Miro treated them to another bottle of brandy \u2013 bought with my savings \u2013 and then left. From where I sat on the wall, I could see almost all the rooms in the pub while a beech tree concealed the view of me from the pub. I watched their wide-open mouths, gulping brandy, guffawing or smugly whispering. I al so watched the waitress who served the merry company, smiling cheerfully all the while. Suddenly she disappeared and I felt a tremor of excitement as if I was waiting for the beginning of agame. Tensely, I watched the window opposite the pub door and felt a great satisfaction when I finally saw the waitress. She approached the telephone cabinet, looked around surreptitiously and placed a GalI. I had the fleeting desire to run to the pub as I usually did and warn the collected company but my rage was stili too great. I concentrated on the image of the crushed cat\u2019s flesh. But then I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. I     jumped from the wall and ran towards the pub. But it was too late. The police had co me faster then they ever had before. They rushed into the pub, snatched the workers, yelled at them and pulled two of them from the group. They threw something into the face of the first and then beat him to the ground with clubs. They chained the other. Two police men seized another worker who was resisting. Each grabbed a foot each and thus they dragged him to the police station. At first, he writhed and twisted but then he cal med himself and used both hands to protect his head as it bump against the ground. Something white and bloody fell from him but this time I didn\u2019t pick it up.     That was when I finally understood my mother who had never beaten me when I did something unpleasant or naughty. instead , she kindly and lovingly explained to me how I should behave the next time. She probably thought that would be the easiest way to spare me pain and, perhaps even more, to spare herself pain. For no beating or punishment will release you from what you did out of hatred, stupidity, envy, self-conceit or ignorance. Although Miro, the shoemaker, comforted me by saying that he hadn\u2019t expected such a denouement, I feel ashamed to this very day.     I didn\u2019t randomly choose the events from my youth I wanted to tell about. Indeed, I think I chose events from my life that did not favor love, grace or forgiveness, poetry or faith. Yet these events are deeply connected with the secrets of being and of Creation, which I must have subconsciously understood even in those years.     I could never imagine God as a Being living in the vastness of the universe, a Being who from a suitable distance controlled, directed or merely observed what was happening. So I have never been able to understand people who even today see k God in this vastness. I didn\u2019t understand them back then and I don\u2019t understand them today. God is present everywhere. In all dimensions. Back then I already had a feeling that God is both cosmic and trans-cosmic.     I have also understood for a long time now that God is not only infinitely loving and understanding but that He also possesses an infinite sense of humor. Whenever I vainly asked God to give me a sign of His presence in those days, I would experience Creation, nature, people and the things all around me with a total openness oft he soul, with the utmost admiration and affection, with a passion and an understanding of mystery. Here I would also like to say that I was critical toward things and deeds, which were not in accord with my own conscience, a growing conscience I instinctively cultivated. The intensity of these feelings and experiences,. especially the tragic ones, gave me the foundation and the breadth to be able to accept everyone. Back then and stili today. From the people on the margins of society \u2013 almost non-persons \u2013 to the greatest people who though some\u00adtimes humble in their needs and potential penetrated through to the transparent truth of this world. As I did right along with them, slowly, though critical dialogue. Mystery inevitably vanishes into the deepest darkest depths of truth, a truth that cannot be delineated by mere walls. The moment you erect a wall or even sense one, you are lost. The poet, Dane Zajc, described it this way: \u201cThis is the first and real death of a poet; the death of his body is only a formality.\u201d There are limits set for man, limits that nevertheless crumble into the darkness of transparent truth. These limits cannot be de\u00adscribed as mere walls. Good and evil cannot be taught by means of a ruler or secular laws; the difference between good and eviI exists in the opaque depths of man, in his soul, in his very origin. And these depths can only be iIIuminated by God and by love for nothing, by love given freely, by active love. Because evil is something spiritual. Although I intend to leave open the possibility of dual explanation of the soul at the end of these reflections, I think it is necessary to look at the foundation of doubt to arrive at a final understanding and explanation of the soul. The opinion of many individu\u00adals and of many great thinkers is that the soul and the body are the unrepeatable essence of man\u2019s personality and cannot be divided from each other. They are a unique gift from Nature or God, a gift which ceases to exist with human death. The ancient Greeks connected this uniqueness of spirit and body with the cosmic order but also believed that the soul ultimately escapes from the body.     However, the effort to understand the immortal soul stems from the very beginning of incarnation, that is from the times when man realized the difference between good and evil and was, as a result, expelled from Eden. Faith in the eternal soul that first emerges or ignites into life in the human embryo floating in the ocean of the mother and only leaves the human being when the body biolog\u00adically dies, is the foundation of our faith and hope. Herein lies the difference between the material universe which is transitory and the spiritual universe which is eternal.     I would like to illuminate the problem of the soul from the standpoint of my own artistic and conceptual nature, from the dimension of my own reason and experience. Therefore, I must first ask some questions connected with my understanding of and doubts about the eternity of the soul. And I must ask these questions on a certain level of perception.     The question of the soul is essentially the question of eternity. And questions about eternity are asked about and limited to death. That means that the (physical) death of the body and the soul are on a certain level asymmetrical. They don\u2019t correspond to the notion of eternity; the experi\u00adence of life is by definition limited by death. Everything in the Nature of Adam is transitory and ephemeral. Active love is the only thing that surpasses the instincts of the man-animal and reach\u00ades toward eternity. But this is onlyahope, an agreement \u2013 pretty much unilateral \u2013 which man made with the eternity of nature, that is with God.     Adam not only conceptualized the distinction between good and evil, but he also recognized the might of Creation and the power of Nature. He knew that the darkness behind which the charming Nature of the day hid represented the Other, .the even mightier entity in the night sky. It represented the infinite side of the same Nature in which he lived. Adam soon understood that he was the only living being to whom the mighty powers of Nature had revealed Creation. This aware\u00adness of the self, the consciousness of a being who can see with his inner eye: this is the fate of Adam and our own fate. Indeed, this inner eye is the origin of man, the origin of the soul. The beginning of man\u2019s consciousness and his conscience mind is this fatal and mysterious feature. Without it, the answer to the question \u2013 who is man? \u2013 can only be expressed in the outward form of man and his existence.     Man submitted to this mighty force, to this vision of nature and he dropped to his knees before it. He felt the divine nature of creation and eternity. Love and awe acquired different dimensions and, not only those that promote the existence of the species, the human race. Along with the development of this active love towards fellow-man and towards Nature, man also developed the spiritual opposite of love \u2013 evil. Cain and Abel are our destiny as well.     It is possible that the idea of the immortal soul emerges precisely from the notion and concep\u00adtualization of the special role of man in Nature. Death doesn\u2019t sever our bonds with loved ones when they die because their spiritual presence remains alive in our souis. Reaching eternity, connection with the Divine, is our only hope. It alane gives a higher purpose to life and to love, both of which are so beautiful as to sometimes seem fatally tragic. Man soon discovered that he could not attain the infinity and eternity of Nature with his mortal body or with his spirit or his soul.     It probably didn\u2019t take long before his inner eye met the eye of the Creator, that is, of God. And thus we can begin to look for the first trace of man\u2019s origins.     Here I need to pose another important question regarding the soul: What is truth and how it is possible to recognize or anticipate it? Is truth something finite that retreats into the most opaque depths of man\u2019s purpose? The question of the soul is also the question of truth and man has forged many pathways to truth.     I would also like to point out the interdependency of process and force in the universe which togeth\u00ader prevent chaos and unpredictability and, left on their own, create the relationships within the universe and the growth (lnclination) of the universe. Similarly, the interdependency of (flesh) man-animal and (spiritual) man facilitates the process of truth. Man wants to know the essence of Nature \u2013 both its material and spiritual essence \u2013 because there exists in man the unending desire to pluck the apple of eternity. Saint Paul already reflected on the four ways to arrive at an understanding of truth. Later in the history of thought and even today, wise men and scholars recognize these four threads that lead to the understanding of truth. This whole method of thinking tries to find traces of these threads that lead to the Knot of truth. They ask the question \u2013 What is truth? \u2013 but do not answer the question. The truth can only be declared by God. This essential wisdom can be traced to the times when man was stili a spontaneous part of nature, left to the blind forces and fullness of his own passions, fears and life. Thus I arrive at the third question of the soul: To what measure are we permeated with and committed to primeval Nature with which our most distant ancestors existed in perfect harmony? To what degree do we possess love for Creation and to what degree do we possess irresponsibility for Creation? How much of this primeval ease and love, competition and struggle to continue the species stili exists within each of us? The great Johann W. Goethe was one of the first who sought to understand the story of Adam. He explored and studied the primitive jawbone, distinctions in which were supposed to account for the difference between Adam and the animals. He arrived at an understanding as to why modern man no longer has this bone. He discovered that in the course of man\u2019s evolution, the bone atrophied and the jaw closed. Goethe believed, as did Leclerc before him, that Man is in fact an animal. Science also began to slowly distinguish mythological heritage from scientific truth. Adam had evolved in a way that ultimately drove him from the harmonious rules of nature and thus separated him from animals. He developed a creative brain (the neocortex dominates here) and, with it, an awareness of himself, his neighbors, of beautiful nature and the sky, especially the night sky into which he seemed to sink and melt. He began to observe and admire the nature that had co-created him over the course of millions of years. He experienced the miracle called Creation. It is said that the human animal exists beneath this cortex. Certainly, it would exist with out the cortex. All that lives emerges from the miracle of trans\u00adforming dead matter into living matter. All that lives was created in the time when the red-hot fiery globe began to cool. Perhaps a comet or an asteroid from the universe brought the seed of life to earth and all living beings on the Earth are thus connected with this ancient life. But ancient life evolved in many different directions. The most wonderful creatures lived in the roots of the human tree: the gentie and tender white gibbon and our common ancestor who lived 25 million years ago on the island of Rufus.     And, of course, there are other less pleasant beings in man, beings whose essence are decanted from remote times into the present.     ln the darkness of his subconscious \u2013 traces of which lead back to the coming to life of dead matter \u2013 man searches for a freedom unencumbered by the moral standards of civilization, the freedom where the pure source of human existence with Nature is presumed to reside. Man searches in pre-civilization, in the times before even families were formed. In the times when he was entirely committed to earthly nature. Back then, the night sky represented only darkness and danger. Night was the time for predators. The time for nightmares Jhat penetrate the darkness no matter how dark it may be. A darkness in which it is impossible to hide. fy1an, trapped as he is in the norms of family and civilization, is often obsessed with the ease and freedom of animals. But there is no true freedom anywhere in nature; rules and laws are strictly defined in herds of animals, in hives and other groups and creatures that transgress these laws are eliminated. There is no less unfortunate being than an animal or a man who is ostracized from its community. Even the mighty lion is destined to a horrible death if he has been defeated by his rivals and exiled from the pride. He will either die of hunger or be mercifully exterminated by hyenas. A few of nature\u2019s creatures may exist in total freedom but they represent humanity\u2019s most frightening night\u00admares. And perhaps even these creatures are too preoccupied with killing to be truly free.     The subconscious reaches towards the origins of incarnation, towards the instinct for survival, love and primeval fear, the unity of Nature and finally towards a conscious understanding of Na\u00adture. Back to the time when man transferred his creative energy from tools and objects of survival to spiritual values, the burial of loved ones, leaving on the walls and in the depths of subterranean caves a physical trace of his spiritual presence. Today the presence of this Other stili exists in us. The presence of Otherness as well.     Purity, which was the basis on which Adam conceived his pri mary understanding of the world and of Nature, represents the artist\u2019s connection with the very foundation of all human under\u00adstanding. Rudolph Arnheim thinks that these pure ancient features are preserved in the depths of the human mind, that they are both irreplaceable and absolutely necessary.     The belief, however, that elementary cognition and images of reality are the one true essence of real art leads inevitably to primitivist aesthetics which can not contain the refinement of the human mind and its output. Because art as the expression of amature personality is never sim\u00adple; it can not necessarily be reduced to the simplicity of the undeveloped mind. The apparent simplicity of the essence of a genuine masterpiece is just as deceitful as the apparent essence of a truly simple artistic product.     The cult of the subconscious in art is one of the most dangerous substitutes for real depth in genuine creation.     According to Arnheim, there is no reason to believe that the deepest wisdom exists only in the most secret parts of the subconscious. Wisdom must emerge from the harmonized efforts of all layers of the mind, from its peculiarity and its refinement. The prototype of art is not, in fact, the stony colossus at Easter Islands; it is rather the connection between what is elemental and the perfection we find on the walls of Lescaux, Altamira, on Cezanne\u2019s canvases or in the statues of Henry Moore.     The fourth question of the soul demands the question of faith: What is faith that binds together and brings sense to all questions of the soul? The question of faith is the question of good and evil as well. Faith is divine grace; it is our salvation from nothingness. Good and evil exist in human understanding and conceptualization of Nature. Therefore in order to con sider good and evil, it is first necessary to explore the possibility that these two features be long in the dualistic structure of the Universe Le. in the very nature of the Universe. Many thinkers and scholars prefer to insist on the indifference of the universe to such trivia as the destiny of mankind or even to the (singular) death of our whole galaxy in a Black hole.     Maksim Sedej ml.: O dobrem in zlem I. variacije na sliko V. Carpaccia Olje in rempera na lesu 100\u00d7100 cm, 1965     Yet good and evil enable us to conceptualize creation in other possible civilizations that may emerge in the endless space of the universe. They al so enable us to conceptualize creation on another level in our own conscious life. Good and evil can only exist at the highest possible level of awareness because they are basically a product of conscience. Good and evil are thus of spiritual origin. There is a great deal of evidence that these two traits or features of everyday life intermingle and transform themselves in asimilar way as subatomic particles, that is in accor\u00addance with Heisenberg\u2019s principle of indeterminacy. In other words, their interaction does not take place simply for cosmic reasons but because of laws, customs and the spiritual dimensions that are the forces behind the civilizing process of mankind and of individual human communities. Good and evil appear differently in the various communities to which individuals belong. Individual human communities consciously or randomly plan the strategies of their survival and evolution regardless of the means and deeds by which they attain these goals. Good and evi I intermingle and exchange in direct proportion to the efficacy of the deeds that ensure the level of prosperity and vitality of individual human communities. Today\u2019s modern scientific society already places itself \u201cbeyond good-and evil\u201d. In other words, it establishes secular laws that make society possi\u00adble regardless of the conscience of individuals. Yet the question of the conscience is the essen\u00adtial question of good and evil precisely because of the relationship between the individual and society. Conscience and faith are the private domain and right of each individual and so they must never be manipulated on behalf of \u201chigher causes\u201d or various ideologies. Soon after Taras and I experienced the storm in my little valley and the apparition of the church outlined with helium light, I made two paintings. Both were closely connected with my attitude to good and evil. The first one, Of Good and Evil, a variation on Carpaccio, was conceived as a triptych. In the middle there were two oblong paintings: at the top was a copy of Carpaccio\u2019s Saint George and the Dragon, and at the bottom, a replica of the top painting but populated with figures that I had discovered and painted before. The side panels were compositions that logically complemented the two in the middle. The second painting was a pentaptych. *     ln the center, I painted a copy of Bosch\u2019s Creation of Eve and the side paintings represented adecomposition of the central painting. At both edges, the painting sinks into the darkness of Ancient Nothingness so lentitled the composition: The Desert Grows.     Maksim Sedej ml.: Pu\u0161\u010dava raste I. variacija na sliko Stvarjenje Eve H, Boscha Olje in tempera na panelni plo\u0161\u010di, 120\u00d7200 cm, 1965     Both Carpaccio\u2019s and Bosch\u2019s paintings are closely connected with concepts of good and evi!. In Carpaccio\u2019s painting, Saint George defeats the dragon (evil). The painting is both utopian and sym\u00adbolic because it depicts the destruction of evil. Evi I must be killed or destroyed so that mankind will be saved from evil and will be able to maintain the purity (virginity) of our relationship to Creation.     Maksim Sedej ml.: Pu\u0161\u010dava raste II. variacija na sliko H. Boscha: Stvarjenje Eve Olje in tempera na panelni plo\u0161\u010di, 100\u00d7200 cm, 1965     The painting depicts that instant when the spear of the knight in armor, mounted on his horse, penetrates the dragon\u2019s gullet. In that precise instant, evil is not yet dead. (This could be com\u00adpared to Freud\u2019s analysis of the hand movement of Michelangelo\u2019s Moses.) The spear has not yet punctured the dragon\u2019s gullet and the dragon stili stands firm, ready to attack. Evil is not yet definitively defeated and eliminated. The townsfolk knew precisely what it meant to defeat \u201cevil\u201d in the City and, as we know from history, they did it frequently enough in those days. There is no anticipation in the painting of the end of the world or of the Last Judgement day. The townsfolk observe Saint George\u2019s performance from the balconies of the palace. Some of them promenade along the coast of the Piran bay, presumably running errands of some sort. The town is surround\u00aded by walls and fortresses and is thus protected from the evil without.     The great fortress doors leading into the town are thrown open. My father had a reproduction of this painting exhibited in his bookcase and I have always been strangely attracted to it. Con\u00adtests of knights and dragons, which as a child I drew again and again, made a mighty impression on me. Father had many reproductions of Saint George, the principal one being Rafael\u2019s depic\u00adtion of the saint but I was only interested in and ultimately convinced by Carpaccio\u2019s depiction. I discovered the mystics in it, had the same feeling looking into it as I did looking from my little valley at the distance city lights glittering in the night sky. Above, there was the galaxy covering the firmament, countless bright lights and remote stars and beyond, the infinity of the Barje mist.     I must admit that the apparition of the church confused me so much that I must have repressed it into my subconscious. It certainly did not cause me to run immediately into a church to give myself to prayer. I understood the sign in my own way and I slowly harmonized it in the mili of my subcon\u00adscious mind, blended it into the way I saw and sensed the world. God was something totally incom\u00adprehensible and unimaginable for me. The Church, on the other hand, was something entirely differ\u00adent. It was a clear easy path to God, much clearer and easier to imagine than the God and creation of my own heart. The Church was the opposite of science; it learned and taught from the greatest poetic work created in this world: from the Holy Bible. No poetry, however, can be completely explained by reason. One can only experience it in the synthesis (the poet Dane Zajc would say: in the symmetry) of the refinement of the spirit and the refinement of the mind.     The first thing I remember being fully aware of was the fact that I lived in times which were a mixture of good and evil. Sometimes the two seemed to be inseparably connected and at other times they stood on opposite poles, in judgment and mutual recognition.     Maksim Sedej yr., General II Tempera on carton, 50 x 70 cm, 1967     Maksim Sedej yr., General IV, 1968 Tempera on carton, 80 x 70 cm     The general situation in those days was so grotesque and tragic that in my later painterly anal\u00adysis of good and evil, I discovered that I must first identify and define these two human features in accordance with the environment in which I had lived. Only afterwards would I be able to establish a critical attitude towards, on the one hand, the meaning of good and evil in a totalitarian system and, on the other hand, towards the problem of conscience and the difference between spiritual good and evil. Of course, this was only one part of my experience; the other part of my thinking at that time was so intimately linked to the transcendental that it didn\u2019t permit submergence into a rational critique of \u201call that exists\u201d. I tried to unite these two attitudes in the development of my work and later to even build on them. But in that initial period, I developed the foundation for all my later cycles of paintings which, united, represent a whole. While studying in these of ten very contradictory modes, I finally did construct my attitude towards \u201call that exists\u201d. I do not intend to analyze or even present in this book all the creative output that resulted from this experiment. But as far as my painting was concerned, I didn\u2019t get much help from it only the certain knowledge that criticizing \u201call that exists\u201d is a futile exercise and would lead me nowhere. At the time however, it was the only thing that could take me close to the edge, to the nothingness that is one of the many dimensions of poetics and paradoxically of \u201call that exists\u201d. Thus, it was an extremely important experience in my development as an artist.     The intellectualization of painting is part of the technical and scientific breakthrough into con\u00adtemporary art. This alone would not be such a bad thing if it were in equilibrium with the poetic side of creation. It may sound extremely strange but I believe that the majority of contemporary painting and other artistic production is explicitly naturalistic and is connected with daily political and cultural events and with the scientific truths that are ceaselessly being discovered in our era. That is, with history itself. Yet the poetic aspect of artistic creation surpasses the limits of this perspective and is itself an integral part of \u201call that exists\u201d. Only outstanding artists succeed in creating a vision of the whole. Poetics and technological development have their common points that can be mitigated and brought into harmony. These common points comprise various nuanc\u00ades from the excitement about human, scientific and technical achievements to doubts about the new man in the scientific epoch, an entity which is becoming more and more redundant and may one day be replaced \u2013 at least in art and poetics \u2013 by cyber-engineers, by the virtual intelligence of contemporary computers and by the so-called culture industry. In terms of business, it is based more and more on the production of artifacts which at the same time cunningly suggests the notion that the era of artifacts in art and poetics has essentially ended with the development of cyber-technology.     Maksim Sedej yr., General V, 1968 Tempera on carton, 130 x 150 cm     There are only two things that transcend any social situation; the first is the conscience and the second is the awareness of Creation among Christians who profess faith in God and the Gospel.     ln a totalitarian system, you never know when you\u2019lI become the prey. So you must behave with extreme caution and conform to the hunter in almost all respects. The hunter, however, is not an individual but the System that, using individuals, recreates the ancient horrific game between the beast and its prey. If you want to be free in such a System, you can only distance yourself from it.     But even this position was tolerated by the System only to a certain extent and in particular cir\u00adcumstances. You have to remain at the margins of society, denied the means of survival and certainly denied the possibility of advancing your artistic ideas. In such situations, good and evil become merely prag matic and it becomes impossible to define any judgement or moralizing on the basis of good and evil.     Essentially, the majority became a part of the System, perhaps hoping that step by litile step it would turn the System in a direction less radical then it had pursued in the beginning, hoping al so that a bond would slowly be re-created with tradition and that this bond would not exist in too great an oppositions to state ideology. Many entered the System consciously to protect and develop their profession or the scientific progress of their profession. The policy of small steps was iIIus\u00adtrated on a practical level in China. The monstrous reaction to the litile steps intended to slowly carry China back to traditional Chinese culture and civilization was dictator Mao\u2019s \u201ccultural revolu\u00adtion\u201d. I think concentration camps are no more humiliating than the physical erasure of a five\u00adthousand-year-old cultural heritage, the daily abuse and even murder of the cultural and scientific elite of the Chinese nation, the killing of sparrows and the other \u201cgreat leaps\u201d the Chinese had to suffer for \u201cthe cultural revolution\u201d promulgated on behalf of the Marxist avant-garde and the revo\u00adlution. This avant-garde zeal reached its climax in Cambodia where the Marxist minority killed more than a half of its own people because they didn\u2019t have the proper proletarian pedigrees. Such an avant-garde leaves behind horrible devastation and barbarity. Indeed, almost every kind of totalitarianism leaves a wasteland behind it. In Slovenia as well.     I added that \u201cal most\u201d because some totalitarianism systems were able to outdo even them\u00adselves. One need only think of Franco\u2019s regime. But the totalitarian systems that were defeated are somehow preferable to those that simply collapsed after exhausting, robbing and annihilating the material and spiritual values of their peoples.     Maksim Sedej yr., Night of Generals, 1970 Tempera on carton, 47,5 x 51 cm     Maksim Sedej yr., Night of Generals, 1972 Mixed technic, 120 x 120 cm     The following is an artistic Gedankenexperiment: consider the possibility that in such histori\u00adcal circumstances, the futurists, for example, longed to trigger an equally fatal avalanche in the arts. But this was prevented by Cezanne and Picasso and by other great twentieth century artists who remained deeply connected with European and global traditions, with traces of the Other. The interdependency of great artists prevents the singularization of art. They knew that to be artistically and spiritually free, one must accept all the world\u2019s art as one\u2019s own, as one\u2019s founda\u00adtion, one\u2019s basis for reflection. Only then can one give material substance to the artistic vision. To the artistic expression of one\u2019s own vision of the Condition of the world.     The concept of building a new world and a new man was something that all totalitarian systems took literally, deadly, seriously. They were the true avant-garde \u2013 or at least they claimed to be. Or perhaps the futurists were only joking. Did they consider their movement to be something option\u00adal, something that was not, in the final analysis, so serious? But isn\u2019t art always a deadly serious activity? A deadly serious game? What possibilities did artists have in totalitarian systems as long as these systems were ru led by Nazis or socialist realists? And, finally, we must ask ourselves what possibilities are there for artist in impoverished post-socialist states as compared to the glamour and glory of the \u201cdeveloped world\u201d and its culture industry?     There is a difference between contemporary and so-called avant-garde art: it is based on the continuity of the world, of its heritage and of the presence of the Other. And Otherness. It is based on respect for everyone because they make us what we are.     The purpose of the avant-garde should be to make a distinction between artistic sameness and artistic similarity but this is, I believe, in total opposition to the wishes and goals of all revolu\u00adtionaries.     Maksim Sedey yr.: Picture 2, variation on picture Marc Chagalla: Revolution Tempera, oil on woodpanel, 72 x 135 cm 1967     One of the paintings I created during this period was based on comparisons between Renais\u00adsance concepts of good and evil and the times in which I was living. It differed from the paintings that had emerged as an experimental pentaptych painted following the motifs in Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s Creation of Eve.     This other painting, The Garden of Sweetness, appears on the left part of the triptych. Bosch\u2019s vision of the world\u2019s condition was cosmic; it was based on the dualism of the divine, which represents both the good and evil aspects of the secular and human. If you observe mankind from a suitable distance, it is no longer necessary to draw the Tempter or the devil separately. There are in these paintings many hidden symbols that allude to sensuality, inclinations toward evil and much more. Mankind is a blind force and evil rules that force. The Creation of Eve herself was supposed to be the beginning of human evil. In Bosch\u2019s painting, Eve was not created in the heavenly Eden but in the earthly Eden. The tree of knowledge, of good and evil, is lost among other trees; beasts hunt and kill other animals in the animal world of this earthly paradise. The fauna arises from alake, evolves into higher forms and colonizes the landscape \u2013 which is the World. What an amazing representation of the theory of evolution for the Middle Ages! On a litile island in the middle of the lake is the source of wisdom.     Maksim Sedey yr.: Premonition of National Reconciliation II, Oil on canvas, 70 x 90 cm 1972     Maksim Sedey yr.: Premonition of National Reconciliation XI, Oil on woodpanel, 110 x 135 cm 1983     So the evil is already at home in paradise, in the tree of knowledge. The Great Tempter is the snake that was chosen for a reason as the symbol of revelation or understanding. (A huge fiery snake, a trace of a meteorite or of the cataclysm to co me are deeply embedded in the subcon\u00adscious of many nations and frequently expressed in their mythologies.) The snake and the dragon symbolize evil in many religions.     The leaves of the fig tree with which Adam and Eve cover their gen italia led many to a totally different symbolism, different from what this gesture should actually mean (our intimacy). When evi I or the devil possessed a woman, devoted sanctimonious believers recognize and destroy it. Yet I have never understood why evil is burnt if hell itself is the scene of the very greatest fire and the devil is the king of fire. In the Europe of those days, they must have burnt half of hell. Perhaps they were consciously enacting hell. Expulsion from paradise meant that Adam was no longer a part of Nature in which all things exist in harmony. Man only freed himself when he was able to distinguish good from evi!. He freed himself from blind forces, from the spontaneity of natural laws and he began to recognize more subtle invisible forces of nature. Both good and evil stem from the dual nature of man: from the man-animal who eats, multiplies and defends his offspring and the borders of his territory just as all living beings do in their struggle for life in nature. Yet at the same time, man discovered eternity, the immortal soul and the godly presence within him \u2013 and therefore al so love for nothing and grace -, knowledge which arose from his primary curiosity, his exploratory zeal. Indeed Cain and Abel so fatally marked mankind precisely because of their struggle for affection. Or perhaps Cain and Abel simply represent two ways of life: the first is a life of freedom, wandering with flocks and herds, hunting on boundless territories while the second is the tame life of agriculture and domestication, surrounded with borders and fortified homes and walls.     Fallen angels as emblems of evi I are mentioned in the Bible only in the New Testament: in Revelation (7, 8, 9, 12) and in Luke (10, 12). Evi I and its representatives were defeated and expelled from paradise and se nt to earth. (Bosch depicted them as swarms of insects.) Heaven is cleansed of them but their evil power grows here on earth and perhaps elsewhere in the universe.     Maksim Sedey yr.: Premonition of National Reconciliation V, Oil on woodpanel, 68 x 80 cm 1980     The human condition will become ever more complicated with the population explosion. What was once paradise\/nature is now threatened by death and extinction. The paradise of an authen\u00adtic nature on earth is disappearing and dying. Increasingly, it is being substituted by urban civiliza\u00adtion where survival for the majority of people is no different than a daily nightmare in the jungle. Today when mankind is able to actually understand the mighty creation of nature by means of technology, it seems sad that most people no longer know what to do with it, what its purpose is.     Bosch\u2019s dualism falls under the strong influence of the old Persian wisdom that prevailed dur\u00ading the Middle Ages. Eduard Meyer formulates the following dilemma as the crucial expression of Zarathustra\u2019s dualism: \u201cThe dilemma is inevitable: either God is omnipotent and the sole creator of all things which means that he also created evil , physical as well as moral evil, along with spirituality and all human beings, in which case He is not good but as truth less as nature itself. If the greatest wisdom essentially equals the greatest good then God is not very wise, or, if he is very wise and very good and therefore omni-gracious then he is not omnipotent as these very features would limit his omnipotence. Physical as well as moral evil stems from a diametrically opposed force which has always been horribly adverse to God.\u201d     Carpaccio\u2019s painting directed me not to a definitive victory over evil, because this is impossi\u00adble, but to the real essence of evil; it directed me to ceaselessly vanquish evil in myself and in my surroundings. The basic construction of the conscience and Identification with the good can be found in the Ten Commandments which are probably much older than Christianity itself. Chris\u00adtianity logically recapitulated these laws and thus committed mankind to them for ever.     But only Christ and his sacrifice on the cross \u2013 sacrifice for universal mankind \u2013 revealed the truth and purpose that resides in fighting evil with goodness and love and forgiveness. Fighting it with faith in the Resurrection. Incarnation is only possible in a sphere where evil exists. The ques\u00adtion of the source of evil is just as mysterious as the question of the purpose of life, of how to make life meaningful.     Evi I can not be precisely defined at all and evil is by no means merely remnants of opposition to the Ten Commandments. There is no evil in the active love of God. Similarly Christian laws are unnecessary in the active love of one\u2019s fellow man. But unfortunately, only very few individuals are capable of such love.     The refinement of the conscience is only possible with ceaseless growth, with the struggle against e,vil, the defeat of evil. And all of this takes place primarily within the self. Only by building love and the conscience, that is by building the self, can one acquire the power and vision to recognize evil and to resist it.     The growth of mankind and the very destiny of mankind depend on the slightest precedence of good over evil. Good and evil are the two great wisdoms of the universe, the motivating power for everything known to man. Every human is caught in this dilemma, the dilemma of deciding be\u00adtween these two destinies.     Carpaccio\u2019s painting is so magnificent in its artistic harmony and purity that I was much more persuaded by its mysterious beauty than by the literal message I was able to discern at first glance. When I saw the originals of both Carpaccio\u2019s and Bosch\u2019s paintings, I felt their enormous creative energy. It filled me and at the same time pulled me into the paintings, making me accept them in their utmost openness and purity. I have felt this energy in other masterpieces; it is an energy that radiates into the purity of the soul. Into the essence of man.     There are very few people who come into being with goodness, grace and love in their hearts. Christ, at least insofar as he was a man, was the first among them. Such people are our paragons and give us the ho pe and the strength to resist evil even in the darkest times and to try to forgive. Or at least maintain our good intentions by means of grace even when we are unable to love evil people.     I have not finished the cycle Of Good and Evi! though I have already divided it into three possibilities or, rather, three relationships, which I shall explore in this text.     Before I began to systematically deal with these various distinctions, I tried to paint all possible variations and combinations of recognizable symbols of good and evil. (In the case discussed in this chapter, it was Saint George on a horse and the dragon destroying innocence and purity represented in the image of an innocent girl.) Evil is fed by purity and innocence. Variations ex\u00adplored different possible relationships between good and evil , from opposition to equality to an indifferent environment and people who reconciled themselves to whatever was given to them. Evil and good in totalitarian system are almost always grotesque.     The first possibility l explored was simply to identify evil in the surroundings in which I lived; Slovenia, at the time independent republic of the Yugoslav state that itself belonged to the global empire of communism that controlled one half of the planet, a position which was silently con\u00adfirmed- though not directly agreed with \u2013 by the free capital its world. But actual confirmation or agreement was, in any case, rendered irrelevant since the true symbolic signature was the pos\u00adsession of nuclear weapons.     This cycle of paintings revealed the grotesque interconnection between and identification of military and other repressive powers with ideology. The mass extermination of any possible future opposition, political trials, concentration camps and other horrors were closely linked with the Party\u2019s maintenance of power. *     The first paintings in this series featured \u201cgenerals\u201d , a response to the military nature of Yugo\u00adslav and Slovenian political parties. Later on, I added to this cycle a series of paintings of generals and images of Lenin as symbols of communism whose clock \u2013 and time \u2013 had stopped. The second part of the cycle represented the blind forces of revolution as a variation on Marc Chagall\u2019s painting The Revolution.     First, I softened the distinctly biased view of the world\u2019s condition by depicting an image of Christ\u2019s hand, pierced and bloody, calming these blind forces. A new viewpoint and approach to the whole imagery of good and evil emerged from this understanding and thus the cycle The Anticipation of National Pacification was born. I treated the relationship of good and evil in this work in terms of right and wrong ways of delivering the Slovenian nation and the consequences of the search for and materialization of ideas.     There is Christ, symbolically present, who in the chaos of prevailing values shows the hope and purpose of suffering; and what seems the most important to me, Christ\u2019s sign shows man how to endure this chaos, to maintain a good conscience and to resist evil , thus remaining human. With the acceptance of Christ, values are finally defined as well as the limit between good and evil.     Hatred and vengefulness are the greatest evils and therefore the temptations which are the hardest to resist.     He last part of the cycle is dedicated to God\u2019s presence in the world. The largest work in this cycle is The Slovenian Way of the Cross. I painted it for a church which has miraculously re\u00admained standing for more than seven hundred years though it is situated at the very place where the most horrible fratricide in contemporary Slovenian history occurred. Nobody wanted to listen to or understand the vision of the poet, France Pre\u0161eren, who wrote long ago, \u201cSlovenian murder\u00ading Slovenian brother. How horribly blind is man.\u201d     The passions of the cross, which symbolically represents the opening of the soul\u2019s eyes, is depicted in the Church of Saint Vid. Blindness of the soul is surely the most horrible form of blindness.     I have not yet finished my cycle on the theme of good and evil. I still do not have the final answer: the synthesis and purpose of humanity and of the cosmic duality.     The pentaptych I painted according to Bosch\u2019s vision led me in another direction. At first I painted several variations and then I discovered that I too was a part of this same humanity, this same nature permeated with evil, the mankind which \u2013 according to Bosch \u2013 can not be saved.

      "text":" Complex Matter F7     The research within the department of Complex Matter encompasses a variety of research fields, ranging from the synthesis of new materials to fundamental investigations of elementary excitations, self-organising behaviour and adaptive functionality in complex systems. These include anything from nano-biosystems and biomolecules to superconductors and nanowires. The experimental methods used are suitably diverse, from synthetic chemistry to biomedicine, femtosecond laser spectroscopy and magnetometry. The experimental research within the department is strongly supported by theory. Recently, the research activities on new nanomaterials and nanotechnology, such as nanolithography were greatly expanded. Apart from fundamental research, some viable applications have also emerged, particularly in the field of new nanomaterials such as MOsix nanowires. The Department is also involved in the Center of Excellence for Nanotehnology     Dynamics of complex systems We investigate relaxation processes in strongly correlated electron systems. The dynamics of photoexcited electrons is studied in several systems, including superconductors, CDW systems, manganites, heavy fermions, MgB2 and systems with electonically driven transitions.     Theory of complex systems The discoveries of novel functional dynamics in new complex materials requires fundamentally new theoretical approaches for reaching an understanding of the underlying physics. The dynamics of charged complex systems with correlated electrons, particularly high-Tc superconductors and related functional materials is investigated using a variety of phenomelogical and numerical methods.     Nanomaterials: MOSIx, nanowires, fullerene magnetism ... The synthesis of novel nanomaterials is mainly focussed on transition metal cluster nanomaterials such as MoSI nanowires. The research includes synthesis, basic characterisation, measurement of physical properties and functionalisation on the nanoscale.     Applications of nanomaterials and nanotechnology MOSI nanowires promise a variety of possible applications, ranging from monomolecular substrates for biomolecular sensors to fillers in advanced composites. Other applications include field emission devices and tribological composites.     Soft matter research Soft matter research includes several different systems, from confined liquid crystals (in planar, cylindrical, spherical geometries or even HPDLCs) and observations of surface effects, to self-assembly of guanosine and investigations of polymeric aligning layers using optical methods.     Biophysics and Biomedical optics Biophysics research at our department includes experimental studies of molecular motors and protein manipulation with optical tweezers and investigation of electron dynamics in DNA using optical spectroscopy. Biomedical optics and engineering involves studies of laser-tissue interaction and development of novel laser-based diagnostic and therapeutic applications.     Nonlinear optics In Nonlinear optics laboratory we study new materials and their interaction with laser light. We are especially interested in new materials which promise new applications in the following highly competitive fields: optical data storage, optical processing and telecommunications, especially in the form of integrated optics. We are also interested in compact laser sources in the eye-safe wavelength region of 1550 nm. We cooperated with a laser company Fotona from Ljubljana and with the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Japan, studying the optical properties of domain engineered LiTaO3 crystals with Mg doping and various degrees of stoichiometry. These crystals are especially suited for optical parametric conversion from the Nd:YAG wavelength to the eye-safe region. "

(Law Abiding Citizen (2009))     You should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity. (Snatch (2000))     Even being the best is not enough. You have to inspire. Some kind of fear, any kind of fear. (Animal (2005))     Man is allowed to do anything... if he's protecting his family. You know I'm right! (The Cleaner (2007))     Mercy? Sorry, all out of mercy! (Ghostrider (2007))     Who's gonna clean you up?! (The Cleaner (2007))     Resistance is futile. (Star Trek: The Next Generation)     Because the person who wrote that is dangerous. (Fight Club (1999))     What goes around, comes around. What goes up, must come down. (Alicia - Karma)     I'm just getting warmed up... (Law Abiding Citizen (2009))     Just as every cop is a criminal... and all the sinners saints... (Sympathy For The Devil - Rolling Stones)     All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I'm free in all the ways that you are not. (Fight Club (1999))     This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time. (Fight Club (1999))     There is something inside, that they cant get to it, they cant touch. Its yours. Hope. (The Shawshank Redemption (1994))     Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. (The Shawshank Redemption (1994))     Kevin Costner: V stati\u010dnih polo\u017eajih sem zani\u010d. Noge mi zaspijo. (Frank Farmer - Telesni stra\u017ear (2004))     1. The only way to get smarter, is to play a smarter opponent. 2. The more sophisticated the game, the more sophisticated the opponent. (These are the only two given \"rules\". The following are a part of the equation.) The bigger the environment, the easier to control. Find the opponent's weakness. Give them just a little of what they think they want so the opponent simply distracts their victim by getting them consumed by their own consumption. The bigger the trick and the older the trick, the easier to pull. Eventually when the opponent is challenged or questioned, means the victim's investment, and thus his intelligence, is questioned. (Revolver (2006))     There is something about yourself that you don't know. (Revolver (2006))     \u010clovek se za krivico ma\u0161\u010duje, pes pa, \u010deprav je trpin\u010den, ostane prijazen.

(Valhalla Rising (2009))     A wiseguy is always right, even when he's wrong, he's right. Remember that. (Al Pacino v Carlito's Way)     Bipolar. Sadomasochistic tendencies... Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to violence... probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill, the big rush. (Crank 2006)     Evil has a new address... yours!

(Don Corleone, The Godfather)     Take your big stick, and your boyfriend, and go find a bus to catch. (Hard Target (1993))     The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist... (Revolver (2006))     There are two kinds of angry people: explosive and implosive. Explosive is the kind of individual that you see screaming at the cashier... for not taking their coupons. Implosive is the cashier who remains quiet, day after day... and finally shoots everyone in the store. (Anger Management (2003))     Ve\u010dina strelja da ubije. On je streljal, da bi ranil, \u010dakal, da so mu prijatelji prihiteli pomagat. Ubil tudi njih. Iz ene tar\u010de je naredil \u0161tiri. Most boys shoot to kill. He'd shoot to wound, wait till his friends come to help, kill them too. Turned one target into four. (Shooter (2007))     You must never recuperate! (The Rock (1996))     You want reality? Here's my fucking reality! (The Condemned (2007))     Z ljubeznijo je kot z ozonskim pla\u0161\u010dem: pogre\u0161a\u0161 jo \u0161ele, ko je ni ve\u010d. (Gola pi\u0161tola (1988)) "

      "text":" Discover the Joys of Castle Life     Castles usually had the most beautiful vantage points, and the Ljubljana Castle is no exception. Castle cellars and storerooms were always full of the finest selection of delicacies, and castle halls were the stage of the best artists of their time. It is the same now. Yet there is one big difference: today, everyone who appreciates history, art and the joys of everything that is good is welcome at the castle.     Above Ljubljana, the nobility of medieval architecture goes hand in hand with the art of contemporary architecture. The renovated rooms and halls preserve the stories of the past while also hosting new ones. The castle dungeon whispers its dark secrets and the Viewing Tower opens a unique view of the horizon.     There are many wonderful things at the peak of the city. Around the walls of our castle, there is a new world away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Discover the many architectural and historical monuments on the Castle Hill, which you will be led to along pleasant walking trails.     You can climb to the castle every day and still always discover something new. You might be surprised by a fragment of painting on a wall, a book in a reading corner, the first grapes on a grapevine, or the melody of a piper that sounds a little different that day.     There are many castle challenges for the taste buds. Both fans of traditional Slovenian dishes and explorers of new flavours smile with satisfaction. Those with a sweet tooth or lovers of good coffee have an excuse to come back time and time again.     At the castle, we respect and appreciate the culture of the noble drop. We proudly nurture our ancient grapevine, carefully cultivate the Castle Vineyard, which we share with lovers of good wine, and ensure that our cellars are full of bottles of the best wines. You are invited to propose a toast in our wine cellar with premium wines.     Experiences that bring you closer to the mysterious world of the castle     When the lights come on in the city and the stars wake up, it\u2019s time for some great live music. At the castle, you will be able to socialise to the sounds of jazz and a variety of jazz-related rhythms and genres, such as blues, rock, Latin, funk and soul.     The Castle Hill and the Ljubljana Castle have a colourful and sometimes turbulent past. As well as good times, there were sometimes difficult and gruelling periods, but it is all fascinating for history buffs. Learn how the castle lived and survived through centuries of turbulent history.     With selected photographic material, which has been preserved by the architectural bureau Ambient, we seek to guide you through yet another story of the Ljubljana Castle \u2013 the story of its fundamental revitalisation in the 20th century.     STOP! YOU HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING!     Remember to include your stomach in your plans when visiting the castle. It\u2019s the least it deserves! Take it to Gostilna na Gradu or the Strelec Restaurant for lunch or dinner, or to the Castle Wine Bar and Shop for a snack. "

Thus, as over 7,000 companies in the twenty-five Member States prepare their consolidated financial statements in early 2006, they will be making a major, and possibly difficult, transition to the IFRS from various predecessor national GAAP standards. Other major nations, including Russia, China, and Australia are also transitioning to IFRS, and both the U.S. and U.K. standard setters are committed to a process of convergence with the IFRS. Thus, there is accelerating momentum toward worldwide embrace of these financial reporting standards-which a few short years ago were virtually unknown to most major reporting entities.

      "text":" INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE | The non-aligned contemporaneity?     27 and 28 May 2019 | auditorium of the Museum of Modern Art     Conference will be dedicated to the question how to harness the historical visions of the non-alignment movement (NAM) in the light of the current global geopolitical situation. Another important question will tackle the legacy of culture in the spirit of NAM's internationalism and its potentials for the present day.     Naturally, these questions should not be considered as part of some kind of exoticism linked to the past, nor should they harbor nostalgia for the movement itself, for as we know, what many NAM states actually practiced was quite far from the principles the movement promoted. From today's perspective, the concepts of nation-states, identity politics, and exclusive national cultures, which appeared in the cultural political agendas of the time, can be seen as highly problematic. The concept of solidarity also needs to be treated with caution: with whom are we solidary, and how are we solidary? How can we avoid the \u201cwhite savior complex\u201d? And what should be done with the fact that Syria, Pakistan, Libya and most African states are still members of the NAM?     Nevertheless, the movement should not be forgotten in so far as it envisioned forms of politics that took as their starting point peoples and societies that had been forcibly relegated to the margins of the global economic, political and cultural system. The movement also proposed new models that \u201cenabled people to live and not merely to survive\u201d (Svetlana Alexievitch). The struggle against poverty, inequality, and colonialism in the world system, coupled with trans-national solidarity could be useful in a reconsideration of the history and legacies of the NAM today, at a time when colonialism has yet again become more than evident.     However, to truly reconsider the legacy of the NAM in the cultural framework of today more radical measures would need to be considered \u2013 not only on the declarative level, but on practical, applicative levels: on the level of governance, knowledge production and heritage. Next, it would be necessary to translate these new formats and concepts into the spaces of policymaking, not only into those of art and culture, but also in relation to the state, national welfare, and the mechanisms of public administration.     These are some of the topics planned for discussion at the conference.

Ple\u010dnik\u2019s Actuality     How we should understand Ple\u010dnik\u2019s work today     Ple\u010dnik\u2019s work is usually divided in three parts, connected with the three cities in which he worked: Vienna, Prague and Ljubljana. For many years his work was also considered in this order as art history appreciated his early work the most. At that time he was still part of the avant-garde that gathered around professor Otto Wagner. Today, more and more, we appreciate the virtues of his mature period when he deliberately chose his own architectural path. We declared the year 2017 as Ple\u010dnik\u2019s year because of the 145th anniversary of his birth and 60 years since he died.     We should understand that Ple\u010dnik\u2019s move to Prague in 1911 and the First World War caused a break in his work that lasted several years. When he arrived to Prague he was 39 years old, in the year 1920 when he started do get important commissions again, he was 48. During almost ten years of interruption of his work he was at the peak of his creativity. During the war he also faced with unbelievable destruction and loss of lives that shocked the very sensitive Ple\u010dnik. He had enough time to reconsider his attitude towards architecture and chose his own way ignoring the development of contemporary architecture. He saw the essence of architecture in its exceeding of time and therefore he strove towards eternal architecture (architectura perennis) that everyone would understand, not only today but also in the distant future.     Eternal architecture is not the one that stands against the time because of its physical strength, but the one that people can understand and appreciate also in the future. For this reason architecture must contain certain universality, like the great classical pieces of art, for which it seems they have something to tell to all historical periods. And when we would like to tell something, we use language that all understand. For this reason Ple\u010dnik used traditional architectural language of classical elements: column, arch, pyramid, and obelisk \u2013 elements with strong symbolic meanings. Ple\u010dnik believed in Etruscan roots of Slovene nation and therefore considered Slovene nation as legitimate successor of Antique architecture.     This is only the outer address, the real essence of Ple\u010dnik\u2019s architecture lies in its creativity. There is no recipe for good architecture as every architect has to deal with several conflicting requirements that exclude in advance any ideal solution. So architecture is always a compromise between desires and possibilities. The quality of architecture lies in the creativity of this compromise and not in its appearance. Beside this Ple\u010dnik\u2019s architectural solutions are also original: a bridge is not a bridge but rather a square on the water, library is a temple of wisdom and the morgue is not central exhibition of the dead, as Ple\u010dnik used to say, but an architectural park of farewell chapels.     The exhibition would like to explain that Ple\u010dnik\u2019s work is not only part of our past, but a live tradition where lessons could be learnt for contemporary architecture.

September 2013     Protey Temen was born in 1984 in Moscow and has been creating and designing for most of his life. Over the last 8 years he has been working in a field that covers design as well as art. He studied at the Art and Production Department of the Humanitarian Institute of Television and Radio for a year (2011) and then transferred to the International Institute of Advertising, specialising in art direction, where he graduated in 2006. He joined ZungeDesign Studio in 2004 and was promoted to Art Director in 2004. He has worked freelance since 2008. The following year, he launched an art project group called Krovi with Dima Kavko. In 2010, the group won the Bronze Prize at the European Design Awards for the project Dollars and Rozes. His current work is marked by the on-going project Abstract Identity, which is supplied by various workshops, publications and exhibitions.     This exhibition will showcase posters and prints which the author has designed especially for this occasion. The concept of his work is best described as abstract identity, workaday spectacularity. Extremes such as body and spirit, artificial and natural, real and abstract are confronted in his work, producing a spark in their collision. The dialogue between these two extremes grows by itself, and is compared by the author to \"growing flesh on the carcass\". That carcass becomes a framework, peeped in the environment, taken out of context. To be able to provide acute attention to each subject, the use of language of abstraction seems appropriate. Flexible, vibrant and absorbing new meanings taken out of context. As a result, we obtain artefacts of these events. A chronicle documenting itself.

Abstract: Knowledge is the most crucial resource of the 21st century. For professional service firms (PSFs), knowledge represents the input as well as the output, and thus the fundamental base for performance. As every organization, PSFs have to deal with errors \u2013 and how they do that indicates their error culture. Considering the positive potential of errors (e.g., innovation), error management culture is positively related to organizational performance. This longitudinal quantitative study investigates the impact of error management culture on knowledge performance in four waves. The study was conducted in 131 PSFs, i.e. tax accounting offices. As a standard quality management system (QMS) was assumed to moderate the relationship between error management culture and knowledge performance, offices' ISO 9000 certification was assessed. Error management culture correlated positively with knowledge performance at a significant level and predicted knowledge performance one year later. While the ISO 9000 certification correlated positively with knowledge performance, its assumed moderation of the relationship between error management culture and knowledge performance was not consistent. The process-oriented QMS seems to function as facilitator for the more behavior-oriented error management culture. However, the benefit of ISO 9000 certification for tax accounting remains to be proven. Given the impact of error management culture on knowledge performance, PSFs should focus on actively promoting positive attitudes towards errors.

      "text":" Sanja Ivekovi\u0107, Triangle 2000+, 1979 photograph (1 from a series of 4). Collection of Moderna galerija, Ljubljana     The museum confederation L'Internationale has invited artists Babi Badalov, Osman Bozkurt, Simnikiwe Buhlungu, Ola Hassanain, Sanja Ivekovi\u0107, Sini\u0161a Labrovi\u0107, Rogelio L\u00f3pez Cuenca & Elo Vega, Kate Newby, Daniela Ortiz, Zeyno Pek\u00fcnl\u00fc, Maja Smrekar, Isidoro Valc\u00e1rcel Medina, Guy Wouet\u00e9, Akram Zaatari, and Pawe\u0142 \u017bukowski to join a conversation from their present working and living spaces, conditions and places. Their reflections suggest new perspectives on public\/private space, solidarity and critique that are intrinsically connected with the present time.     In 1979, on the day of President Tito\u2019s visit to Zagreb, the artist Sanja Ivekovi\u0107 carried out an 18-minute performance titled Triangle (1979) on her balcony. She went out and started to read a book, drink a whisky, and made gestures as if she was masturbating until a security official arrived and ordered her inside. Do such domestic spaces still have the potential to be subservive and make a public statement, as Ivekovic's balcony did in the late 1970s?     During this time of global isolation, virtual space, as well as the windows, balconies or facades of our homes have taken on the role and importance of town squares for collective expression, while also blurring the boundaries between public and private spheres. Artists in Quarantine is a modest way to contribute to the conversation about the effects of the current pandemic, redeliberating the communication channels that have influenced the present perception and consumption of information, as well as rethinking the potentiality of existing spaces.     Artists contributions will be shared online through L'Internationale\u2019s social media channels, @internationaleonline, and via the websites and social media channels of members of the confederation from April 21st. Artists' proposals will be published twice a week, every Tuesday and Thursday.     L\u2019Internationale confederation gathers seven major European art institutions: Moderna galerija (MG+MSUM, Ljubljana, Slovenia); Museo Reina Sof\u00eda (Madrid, Spain); MACBA Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (Spain); Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst Antwerpen (M HKA, Antwerp, Belgium); Muzeum Sztuki Nowoczesnej w Warszawie (Warsaw, Poland), SALT (Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey) and Van Abbemuseum (VAM, Eindhoven, Netherlands), which team up with HDK-Valand Academy (Gothenburg, Sweden) and the National College of Art and Design (NCAD, Dublin, Ireland). The confederation and its partners are working now within the frame of the project Our Many Europes, co-funded by the Creative Europe programme of the European Union, featuring over 40 public activities including exhibitions, workshops and research.     Other ongoing transversal projects by L\u2019Internationale     L\u2019Internationale Online, a common project for sharing research, arts and politics, aiming to enhance the multiplicity of vocabularies for production and distribution of knowledge through a lens of a shared sense of urgency towards the world we co-inhabit.

      "text":" Ten startups presented their innovative business solutions to more than 350 event participants as well as a couple of thousand viewers online, including those in ABC\u2019s premises in Munich, Kiev, and Silicon Valley.     The Demo Day represents the closing event and the pinnacle of the three-month-long startup programme aimed at accelerating products and services. Since the intention is to showcase products open to potential investors, it is full of mixed emotions \u2013 anxiety, stress, but also joy and happiness after the presentation is done. Out of the 21 startups that participated in the programme, ten had the opportunity to present their solutions at the event: Slovenian startups Melon & Lime, Taia, Semaforum, Sleepy bottle, SnapGuest, and Codebrainer, the mixed American-Slovenian team Bare Peak, Octopull from Chile, Stormborn Studio from Italy, and Videobolt from Serbia.     Dejan Rolji\u010d, founder and CEO of Acceleration Business City, opened the event by thanking its loyal partners, including BTC, Zavarovalnica Triglav, EnaA, Petrol, and Telekom Slovenije. He emphasised the importance of a good business partner, especially right at the beginning of a given enterprise. Together with Ur\u0161ka Je\u017e, co-founder and CEO of ABC Accelerator Ljubljana, they also presented partners and participants with a couple of awards. This time, the award for best partner went to Zavarovalnica Triglav, whose team is also part of the ABC Enterprise programme and is already working on two new products. The ABC Enterprise best mentor award went to Ernest \u017dejn and the best lecturer award to Pier Francesco Geraci, as voted by the participating startups. Rolji\u0107 concluded the event with the thought that ideas should be realised right away instead of being put off until tomorrow, and that it might just happen that you will not always be the best at something, but that it is therefore all the more important that you give it your best shot.     Part of the event was also a panel on the particularities, similarities, and differences between Slovenian, Austrian, Czech, and Hungarian ecosystems. The discussion was moderated by the ABC Accelerator\u2019s Jakob Gaj\u0161ek, while guests included Eva Rez (Day One Capital, Budapest), Andrej Kiska (Credo Ventures, Prague), and Markus Lang (Pioneers Ventures, Vienna).     All the startups will now tackle new challenges, as will the ABC Accelerator team, which is about to start preparations for its new and redesigned programme. In October they will welcome 10 of the best \u201cDeep Tech\u201d startups, who will work and accelerate for at least a month in Silicon Valley as part of the three-month-long programme. They will accelerate even faster than before as they focus on products pertaining to blockchains, artificial intelligence, big data, and analytics. "

You may also visit us at our workshop by making an appointment via +386 31 631 002.     How to measure your foot size? Please follow our instructions here.     Feel elegant and classy! Even at home.     You come home, take off you shoes and slam into slippers. You're still elegant, your legs screaming for joy, as Ursanina women's wool felt slippers are simply comfortable and beautiful.     For ten years now, these women's wool felt slippers are our bestseller. This fact is not surprising, because they are distinguished by unique design, vibrant colors and natural materials. Even the finest guests will get excited when they see such splendid slippers.     Invite a friend to tea, dance alone in the living room, read your favorite book or magazine.     Yes, you will be happy to be home! ;)     Ursanina women's felt slippers are made of 100% woolen felt. Due to its unique natural characteristics, your feet will feel pleasantly calm in Ursanina women's felt slippers both in winter and in summer. They will not sweat because the wool breathes and radiates heat.     The soles are coated and do not slip.     Rubber can also be added to the sole.     Since the felt is a flexible material, the shoe is well formed on the leg after a few days of wearing. If you have a wider foot, we recommend selecting a larger number.     39 (8)     When the slippers get dusty, they should be slaked or stamped, and the harder dust is removed with an adhesive tape. How? Simply stick it over the seam, press well and peel off. Voila! The dust will be applied to the adhesive tape.     We do not brush our shoes (nor soles), as the fabric will crawl or tear.     Wash them in a washing machine, on a wool program at 30\u00b0C, with gentle wool detergent. Vacuum them before washing. Since wool slightly shrinks by washing, after washing insert bare feet to form their shape again. Then let them dry. We can also fill them with soft polybags to keep their shape. "

      "text":" Pregled razpisa     NASLOV     Better prepared regional and local authorities to adapt to climate change     Kratica razpisa\/topic identifier: HORIZON-MISS-2021-CLIMA-01 Zanimivo za IJS: neposredno Objava ali napoved razpisa: razpis IJS podro\u010dje razpisa: fizika, kemija, biokemija, materiali in okolje, informacijske tehnologije     NAMEN RAZPISA     This action should provide services to support regional and local authorities in their preparation to meet the current requirements of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism legislation, and the foreseen adaptation objectives in the Climate Law, underpinning the new EU strategy on adaptation to climate change in terms of research and innovation, data and knowledge, and capacity and skills.     Furthermore, this action should take stock of past, ongoing and future activities related to climate change adaptation, including innovative approaches to climate adaptation plans to implement a mix of solutions \u2013 based on technological, non-technological, and social innovations \u2013 and to explore transformative pathways. This would give an indication of best practices and solutions already available, gaps and barriers to address climate change adaptation in a more holistic matter; as well as options for transformative and innovative approaches.     In particular, the action should help regional and local authorities to:     better understand their climate risks, solutions available to mitigate such risks and ways to achieve climate resilience, including by some of the following activities: facilitating access to services specific to climate risk assessments at regional and\/or local level, focusing on particularly vulnerable regions; assisting in the elaboration of climate risk management plans, including provisions for their monitoring and evaluation; providing a tailor-made overview of potential technological, non-technological, and social solutions \u2013 in particular breakthroughs, disruptive and radically new innovations \u2013 (which includes their effectiveness, inclusiveness, costs and benefits) and establishing close synergies with the Horizon 2020 European Green Deal call, in particular the topic on Climate-resilient Innovation Packages for EU regions (LC-GD-1-3-2020), and the topic on developing end-user products and services for all stakeholders and citizens supporting climate adaptation and mitigation (LC-GD-9-2-2020), as well as drawing on the results from relevant projects from Horizon 2020 and the LIFE Programme; identifying and mapping of priority research and innovation areas where gaps exist; facilitating a process designed to co-develop a vision of what a transformation towards climate resilience might mean in their regional and\/or local context taking a systems approach (key community systems and enabling conditions), and including an analysis of levers, barriers and tipping points for transformation; jointly (consortium participants, regional\/local authorities and relevant stakeholders) assess adaptation capacity, behavioural insights, changes in social practices, skills and conditions (e.g., framework, governance, finance) needed to undergo a transformation towards climate resilience, with the objective to develop a self-assessment tool available to those authorities that are not able to receive the services from the consortium. establish approaches and processes that enable co-design , co-development, and co-implementation with citizens and stakeholders (including academia, industry, social partners, public authorities and regulatory agencies) in line with the recently adopted Climate Pact[6], through some of the following activities: cross-fertilisation of cutting-edge science on climate change impacts and risks that is locally\/regionally relevant and comprehensible; fostering co-production of data at local level and knowledge and co-design of climate services to support a transformation towards climate resilience; supporting the implementation of citizen science, citizen observatories, social innovation and other means of joint knowledge gathering and monitoring to support a transformation towards climate resilience (e.g. the projects on air quality[7]); assisting regional and local communities in the preparation of large-scale living labs[8] for the development and testing of transformative inclusive solutions towards climate resilience (exploring synergies with living labs foreseen in relevant Horizon Europe partnerships); facilitating the establishment of inclusive and deliberative governance processes supporting just transitions; map and facilitate synergies by identifying funding and financing opportunities for the creation of important R&I-related enabling conditions in support of reaching climate resilience, including in the context of establishing close synergies with the preparatory action on Coordination of complementary actions for missions in this Work Programme, (topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-COOR-01): Data and operational climate services, including National Meteorological Services, Copernicus Climate Change Service, and Copernicus Emergency Management, Horizon 2020 and Europe relevant projects, as well as relevant action of GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems); the region-specific smart specialization strategies (ERDF\/CF PO1) and regional operational programmes for Strategic Objective 2; the Digital Europe Programme, in particular the digital twin on climate change adaptation; the skills agenda and the European Social Fund (ESF+) to create the needed capacities and skills; Horizon Europe instruments, including those of bottom-up nature like the European Research Council or the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions, and its partnerships and missions; other relevant EU, national and or regional programmes and instruments (e.g. Just Transition Fund, Recovery and Resilience Facility, European Structural and Investment Funds, Erasmus+ programme, European Solidarity Corps, Invest EU, and relevant financing by the European Investment Bank). Actions should address all the three main objectives under the scope, tackling some of the specific outcomes (sub-bullets under the three main objectives). Therefore, the consortium[9] should possess the expertise necessary to successfully deliver on the three main objectives. Regional and local authorities are not expected to be consortium participants, but to receive services from the consortium; in other words, they are the target groups of the projects activities.     The services covered by this topic should be accessible to as many regional and local authorities as possible. The consortium is expected to accompany the authorities and relevant stakeholders through the delivery of the services needed and to the achievement of clear outcomes. Priority should be given to regions or locations with the high vulnerability[10], limited resources and\/or low adaptive capacity[11] to climate change impacts. Demand could be higher than what can be supplied within the limits of this action, therefore proposals should include criteria for how to identify the regional and local authorities most in need of these services. These criteria will ensure that a variety of locations are represented, in as many countries as possible, reflecting the diversity in climatic risks in Europe, as well as differences in socio-economic and demographic conditions, and in approaches to mitigating such risks. Such criteria should also take into account the characteristics of the populations concerned and the vulnerability of the locations in order to subsequently understand the effectiveness of the services provided by the consortium.     The project is expected to have a duration of three years. Early in the project the consortium should define a list of regional and local authorities that would benefit from the projects activities. By the end of the project, the consortium should propose a strategy to maintain the services offered through a platform, entity or partnership with relevant organisations.     Consortium participants should establish synergies with relevant projects funded under this Work Programme as well those originating from Horizon 2020, in particular the Green Deal Call (topics in area 1, as well as LC-GD-9-2-2020 and LC-GD-10-1-2020), should be explored and established during the course of the project. In particular, projects resulting from the calls mentioned above, as well as from Cluster 3 on Disaster Resilient Societies should be foreseen, Cluster 5 on Climate, Energy and Mobility, and Cluster 6 on Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment. In addition, the consortium should draw, when appropriate, upon the capabilities, expertise and data available at the Joint Research Centre in the area of Smart Specialization and urban sustainable development strategies, and the European Environment Agency through the European Climate Adaptation Platform (Climate-ADAPT), the European Topic Centre on Adaptation and the EIONET network of Member States.     The possible participation of the JRC in the project will consist of connecting to the regions, local communities and cities, which in their smart specialisation \/ local-urban development strategies are interested in the priority themes relevant for the mission.

      "text":" TROLLFEST: \u2018Svet je tornado driske\u2019     15. aprila, 2021, 18:49 Gal Jerman Intervjuji Komentarji so izklopljeni za TROLLFEST: \u2018Svet je tornado driske\u2019     Pravi norve\u0161ki balkan metalci so nazaj! Iz doma\u010dega mesta Oslo so Trollfest izdali EP \u2018Happy Heroes\u2019 (iz\u0161el 19. marca pri Napalm Records). Skupina je od\u0161tekana kombinacija elementov folk, metal in punk glasbe, njihove skladbe pa odlikuje predvsem veliko drznosti, energije in neobrzdanega veselja. Tokrat so se \u2013 za njih zna\u010dilno drzno \u2013 lotili skladb \u2018Happy\u2019 (Pharrell Williams) in \u2018Don\u2019t Worry Be Happy\u2019 (Bobby McFerrin).     Z nami je govoril Jostein Austvik.     Trollfest transfomirajo znane hite v svojo energi\u010dno \u201cbalkan metal nori\u0161nico\u201d. Na platformah YouTube in Spotify se lahko pohvalijo z milijoni ogledov, v teh te\u017ekih \u010dasih, ko mnogim primanjkuje upanja, pa so izdali \u0161e dodatno optmisti\u010den mali plo\u0161\u010dek z veselim naslovom \u2018Happy Heroes\u2019, ki vam zagotovo pri\u010daral nasmeh na obraz. Vse skladbe se namre\u010d nahajajo v svetu opitih trolov in risanih junakov. To je veseli metal.     ROCKER.SI: Pozdravljen, Jostein! Kako si? Ali si zaposlen te dni?     TROLLFEST: Po\u010dutim se kar v dobro, sploh glede na vse, kar se dogaja. Zelo pogre\u0161am koncerte, druga\u010de pa u\u017eivam v vsem tem \u010dasu, ki mi je bil dan. S skupino ustvarjamo novo glasbo, snemamo naslednji album in pridno vadimo, da bomo \u0161e bolj\u0161i.     ROCKER.SI: \u201cNorve\u0161ki balkan metal!\u201d Tega pa ne sli\u0161i\u0161 pogosto \u2013 kako prera\u010dunljiva je bila odlo\u010ditev, da boste igrali tovrstno glasbo? Je bila od za\u010detka?     TROLLFEST: Skorajda od za\u010detka. \u017de od za\u010detka smo si \u017eeleli ustvarjati tako glasbo, ampak balkanska glasba je te\u017eavna, z vsemi \u010dudnimi \u010dasovnimi podpisi in specifi\u010dnimi lestvicami, \u0161e posebej za nas Norve\u017eane, ki se radi dr\u017eimo klasi\u010dnih 4\/4 durov ali pa si redko dovolimo kak\u0161no 6\/8 molovsko pustolov\u0161\u010dino, zato smo potrebovali kar nekaj \u010dasa, da smo se privadili. Ampak vsi smo veliki obo\u017eevalci vzhodne Evrope, v resnici imamo \u017ee od nekdaj radi vse vrste folk glasbe.     ROCKER.SI: V marcu ste izdali EP plo\u0161\u010do \u2018Happy Heroes\u2019, ki naj bi bila \u201cnori\u0161nica folk, metal in punk glasbe\u201d (kar lahko po poslu\u0161anju tudi potrdim!). Kako ti \u201csli\u0161i\u0161\u201d va\u0161o glasbo?     TROLLFEST: Nedvomno vem, o \u010dem govori\u0161. Te\u017eko bi kategoriziral na\u0161o glasbo, preprosto zato, ker ko jo poslu\u0161am, sli\u0161im vse te glasbene vplive in je te\u017eko izbrati zgolj enega. Zato tudi te\u017eko napovem, kaj bodo sli\u0161ali poslu\u0161alci. Upam, da bodo sli\u0161ali preklemansko kul skladbe z veliko drznosti, energije in neobrzdanega veselja.     ROCKER.SI: Kako se odlo\u010dite, katere skladbe boste priredili? Ali posnamete ve\u010d verzij iste skladbe?     TROLLFEST: Ko se odlo\u010damo, katere skladbe bomo priredili, preprosto izberemo tiste, ki so nam v\u0161e\u010d in za katere mislimo, da bodo dobro zvenele v na\u0161em slogu. Nato nekdo od nas posname demo posnetek, nakar se pogovorimo, \u010de stvar deluje. Podajamo si posnetek, ga vsi poslu\u0161amo in \u010de smo zadovoljni, skladbo posnamemo in jo izdamo. V\u010dasih takoj deluje, spet drugi\u010d posnamemo ve\u010d verzij, preden pristanemo na tisti, ki nam je najbolj v\u0161e\u010d. Na primer za skladbo \u2018Happy\u2019 smo posneli ve\u010d verzij, preden smo bili zadovoljni, skladba \u2018Don\u2019t Worry Be Happy\u2019 pa je delovala v \u017ee prvem poskusu.     ROCKER.SI: Koliko vas je uradno v skupini? Na\u0161tel sem vas osem. Kako potujete in kje ste do zdaj odigrali najve\u010d koncertov? Ali imate napovedane nastope za leto 2021?     TROLLFEST: Za poleti imamo napovedanih nekaj festivalov, za katere sr\u010dno upamo, da se bodo zgodili. Trenutno nas je v zasedbi osem, na odru ponavadi sicer sedem, vendar skoraj vedno pripeljemo zraven \u0161e prijatelje. Na nekaj koncertih nas je bilo na odru dvanajst. Na\u0161a \u017eelja je, da bi dodali \u0161e trobila. Kdo ve, kaj bo prihodnost prinesla! Nisem prepri\u010dan, ali smo najve\u010d koncertov imeli v Nem\u010diji ali pa mogo\u010de v Franciji, ampak gre za eno imed teh dveh dr\u017eav. Tja potujemo z letalom, v\u010dasih z busom za turneje.     ROCKER.SI: Ste \u017ee obiskali Slovenijo? Morate priti! Glede na va\u0161 zna\u010dilni balkanski metal, lahko zatrdim, da bi vas o\u010dinstvo obo\u017eevalo!     TROLLFEST: Igrali smo na Metalcamp festivalu, in to ve\u010dkrat! Takrat, ko je festival nosil \u0161e to ime. Nekajkrat pa smo se oglasili kar tako tekom na\u0161e turneje, ampak bi si \u017eeleli \u0161e ve\u010dkrat obiskati va\u0161o dr\u017eavo! Vsaki\u010d, ko smo bili tam, smo res u\u017eivali. Publika je bila absolutno fantasti\u010dna!     ROCKER.SI: EP \u2018Happy Heroes\u2019 je plo\u0161\u010dek, ki govori o sre\u010di. Prekipeva od veselja. Kako ostajate sre\u010dni in veseli v teh \u010dasih? Zaupaj nam skrivnost! Res ste kot superheroji, ki jih lahko pokli\u010demo, kadar potrebujemo v \u017eivljenju ve\u010d optimizma!     TROLLFEST: Klju\u010dna sestavina za sre\u010do, \u010de vpra\u0161a\u0161 mene, je dober smisel za humor. \u010ce si se zmo\u017een smejati na svoj ra\u010dun, je pa \u0161e toliko bolje. Svet je nevihta dreka, pravi tornado driske in veliko je ljudi, ki teptajo po vsem, kar vsaj malo spominja na pozitivno naravnanost. \u010ce si osredoto\u010den na to, potem je te\u017eko ostati sre\u010den ali pri zdravi pameti. Absurdnost vsega je dobro videti skozi o\u010di humorja, na ta na\u010din se je mogo\u010de smejati prav vsem. Smejati se v obraz te\u017ekim situacijam je tisto, kar te navdaja z mo\u010djo.     ROCKER.SI: Katere so glasbene zasedbe, ki vas trenutno navdihujejo? Poleg tistih, katerih skladbe ste priredili na EP-ju \u2018Happy Heroes\u2019?     TROLLFEST: Zadnje \u010dase sem veliko poslu\u0161al izvajalce, kot so Jordi Savall, The Coconut Monkeyrocket, Diablo Swing Orchestra, Tool, Igorrr, Moron Police, Mr. Bungle, Troldhaugen, Znous, The Longest John\u2019s, Chotokoeu, Zeal & Ardor, Dennis Pavao, Renaissance, Farmers Market, Hot Head Show, Origin, Oceans Ate Alaska, Merle Hazard, Hans Reichel in The End. Vsak teden sku\u0161am odkriti nekaj novega.     ROCKER.SI: Ali so vam v\u0161e\u010d originalne verzije skladb? Ali gre bolj za preprosto miselnost: \u201cTe skladbe bi zvenele dobro, \u010de bi jih priredili?\u201d     TROLLFEST: Vsaj nekomu izmed nas mora biti v\u0161e\u010d originalna verzija! \u010ce se nas strinja vseh sedem, potem je to odli\u010dno! Balkanska glasba je eden tistih primerov, kjer smo soglasni.     ROCKER.SI: Kako boste promovirali EP? Ste te skladbe \u017ee imeli prilo\u017enost igrati v \u017eivo?     TROLLFEST: Nazadnje smo igrali januarja lansko leto, ampak ko bo pri\u0161el pravi trenutek, bomo v \u017eivo odigrali vse te skladbe. Tudi te z nove EP-ja.     ROCKER.SI: Hvala za tvoj \u010das!     TROLLFEST: Hvala tebi, da nam pomaga\u0161 promovirati na\u0161 EP!     *Angle\u0161ka verzija intervjuja     ROCKER.SI: Hello, Jostein! How are you? Are you keeping yourself busy these days?     TROLLFEST: I am doing fairly well all things considered, really miss playing shows, but otherwise I am enjoying having all this time on my hands. With the band we are staying busy writing more music, recording our next album and trying to get better at stuff in our rehearsal space.     ROCKER.SI: \u201cNorwegian balkan metal!\u201d That you don\u2019t hear too often \u2013 how calculated was the decision to play this kind of music? Was this your desire from the beginning?     TROLLFEST: Almost from the beginning. We wanted to do it from the very beginning, but Balkan music is a bit hard to play with the odd time signatures and the specific scales, especially for \u201cstraight major 4\/4, maybe go on a wild minor 6\/8 adventure\u201d \u2013 norwegians, so we needed some time to learn it. We have however all of us been huge fans of eastern european (actually all kinds of) folk music since forever.     ROCKER.SI: On 19th of March you released EP \u2018Happy Heroes\u2019. It is a madhouse of folk, metal and punk (we confirm!). Do you also see it like that?     TROLLFEST: I can definitely see what you are talking about. I do find it a bit hard to categorize our own music though, simply because I hear and know of so many different influences that are in there and it becomes hard to pick out just a few. In the same way it is very hard to guess at what the audience will hear. My hope is they will hear fucking cool songs with a whole lot of nerve, energy and unbridled joy.     ROCKER.SI: How do you decide which hits you will transform into your \u201cmadhouse#? What is the process like? Do you have multiple versions of the same song that you release?     TROLLFEST: To select songs we basically pick out songs we love that we think will sound good in our style. Then one of us will make a demo tape, we pass it around and discuss it and if it works we will record it and release it. Sometimes it works right away and other times we try many different versions before landing on one we like. For instance, we tried many different versions of the song Happy before we were happy with it, but Don\u2019t Worry Be Happy worked immediately and gave us no worries.     ROCKER.SI: What is the official lineup now in the band? I counted eight members. How do you travel and where do you perform the most? Are there any shows on the horizon?     TROLLFEST: We have a few festivals this summer and currently we have crossed everything we have available in the hope that it won\u2019t be canceled. There are 8 of us in the band, but the usual live line up is seven of us. However we do like bringing along friends to play with us, we did one show with twelve people once and we would love to get a brass band to join us sometime so who knows what the future will bring. I am not sure if we have played the most shows in Germany or in France but it\u2019s usually one of those two countries so most travel is by plane, sometimes a tourbus.     ROCKER.SI: Have you visited Slovenia? You sing balkan metal, crowd would love you here!     TROLLFEST: We played the Metalcamp festival in Slovenia a couple of times back when it was called that, and we have also occasionally stopped by while touring, but we would love to play more in Slovenia. We have enjoyed ourselves immensely every time we\u2019ve been there,and the crowds have been absolutely fantastic!     ROCKER.SI: This EP is all about happiness. How do you stay happy? Give us the recipe! You truly are like superheroes we can call when we need you to get optimistic about life!     TROLLFEST: In my opinion the key ingredient to happiness is a strong and good sense of humor, if you also have the ability to laugh at yourself you are set to go. The world is an absolute shit storm of diarrhea tornados, and there are also alot of people who actively seek to stomp down on anything resembling positive relief. If you focus on that it is very hard to stay happy or indeed stay sane, if however you manage to focus on the absurdities of it all and look for humor in everything there is so much to laugh at. It is also very empowering to laugh in the face of shittiness.     ROCKER.SI: What are some bands that are inluencing you right now? Besides the ones that you decided to cover?     TROLLFEST: I can only speak for myself here, but the artists I\u2019ve been listening to lately are Jordi Savall, the coconut monkeyrocket, diablo swing orchestra, tool, Igorrr, moron police, Mr. Bungle, troldhaugen, znous, the longest John\u2019s, chotokoeu, zeal & ardor, Dennis Pavao, Renaissance, farmers market, hot head show, origin, oceans ate Alaska, Merle Hazard, Hans Reichel, the end and many more. I try to check out something new every week.     ROCKER.SI: Do you like the original versions of the songs? Or is it more of a this kind of thinking involved: \u201cWe think it will sound good if we make a cover\u201d?     TROLLFEST: There is at least one person in the band that absolutely loves the original versions, but between the seven of us there are very few things we all agree is awesome. Balkan music is one of those few things.     ROCKER.SI: Did you the chance to play these songs live?     TROLLFEST: We have not played live since January last year, but when the time comes we intend to play some, if not all of those songs live.     ROCKER.SI: Thank you for your time!     TROLLFEST: Thank you for helping us promote this ep!!!

      "text":" Sites of Sustainability. Pavilions, Manifestos, and Crypts     Curator: Zdenka Badovinac     Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova, +MSUM     Duration: 15 November 2018 \u2014 17 February 2019     In April this year, the exhibition Hello World opened in one of the central Berlin museum\/gallery spaces, the Hamburger Bahnhof \u2013 Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwart, which forms part of the Nationalgalerie. Also Moderna galerija, Ljubljana participated in the exhibition, and this part of the exhibition will now be on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova in Ljubljana.     The exhibition Sites of Sustainability: Pavilions, Manifestos and Crypts consists largely of selected works by Eastern European avant-garde artists from Moderna galerija\u2019s Arteast 2000+ and national collections, combined with works from a number of other public and private collections from Slovenia, Croatia, Germany, Serbia, and Poland. The exhibition was presented earlier this year as a chapter in the extensive exhibition project Hello World, staged in one of central Berlin\u2019s museum\/gallery spaces, the Hamburger Bahnhof \u2013 Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwart, which forms part of the Nationalgalerie. While the Berlin show was comprised mostly of works from the 1950s to the 1990s, the Ljubljana show presents another two, more recent art collectives to underscore the important tradition of collective work in the region.     The exhibition foregrounds alternative models of artistic production such as they developed in Eastern Europe in socialist times, in particular in the territory of former Yugoslavia. Between the 1950s and the 1990s, artists in Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland devised various alternative models of artistic production, in particular as a performative aspect of their art. Rather than merely critically describing the existing conditions, either directly or indirectly, they used their art to actually shape their conditions of work. Thus sites of sustainability can be understood as a kind of parallel infrastructure, built especially through work in local and international collectives and networks, through exhibitions in self-organized spaces, through self-publishing, through parallel economies, and through self-historicizing. This was art that built and maintained social relations and a critical understanding of the world, which it continues to do to this day.     Sites of sustainability are not characteristic only of art, since art always critically affects also its institutions (as long as they are open to alternative approaches). One of the main challenges museums face today how to participate with autonomy in global cultural networks, how to find or shape alternative distribution channels for contents, channels that will not only serve the most affluent and powerful global cultural spaces. In this sense, the Berlin exhibition features more than just works from the Arteast 2000+ collection, but also Moderna galerija and its Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova as an institution with a vision for the globalized world.

      "text":" Route Description     Gaj\u0161evsko jezero Lake is an accumulation lake situated on the \u0160\u010davnica River. It lies between the town of Gaj\u0161evci and the town of Grabe pri Ljutomeru in the municipality of Kri\u017eevci. It is a result of the 1973 construction of a dam on the \u0160\u010davnica River and it became a reservoir for floodwaters. During normal water levels, it is shallow and muddy, with an average depth of less than 3 meters (9 feet).     This lake is the largest and richest fishing area around here. The fishing regime is managed by the Ljutomer Fishing Club, which maintains 10 hectares of the lake as a fish reserve. There are many predatory fish swimming around, such as carps and catfish.     Due to its flat location and relatively constant winds, Gaj\u0161evsko jezero Lake is popular among surfers, who come in large numbers from all over Slovenia and the surrounding countries when there are suitable wind conditions. Unfortunately, the water itself is quite polluted, and it is additionally overloaded with fish, so swimming is not recommended. Never mind that, the nature around the lake is more interesting anyway.     There is a very nicely arranged sandy path lined with wooden planks and it is four kilometres (2.8 milers) long. The diverse wildlife can make any child giddy with excitement and the path is easy enough for toddlers as well.     You can leave your car by the road, in a marked parking lot.     Interesting Facts     \ufeffAdventure Park Kri\u017eevci (\u201cPark do\u017eivetij Kri\u017eevci\u201d) is an activity perfect for both parents and children.

There are currently no other plastic processing methods which could offer such wide array of products and economic advantage.     Thanks to our 20-year experience with this technology we can provide production of many different hollow products with volume from below 0.5L to 30L. The combination of our know-how and suppliers provides a proper processing of semi-products with various devices and robot technology. Furthermore, we also offer counselling in product construction or take over the complete product and tool development. With the year 2016 we now kave knowledge on suction blow molding technology, which in our technical part represents one machine with 7 ton of clamping force.     With blowing technology we can meet the highest quality demands in different industries such as automotive and appliance industries.     Blowing can be done with PE-HD and PP. However, we also have sufficient capacities and know-how to perform custom tests per customer needs. We have 9 blowing machines with closing force from 10 to 40 kN at our disposal. "

      "text":" Tragi\u010dna nesre\u010da na balonarkem tekmovanju. Tragi\u010dno sta se ponesre\u010dila Richard Abruzzo (47) in Carol Rymer Davis (65) po pribli\u017eno 1.660 preletenih kilometrih, potem ko sta izginila v slabem vremenu nad Jadranskim morjem.     Richard Abruzzo and Carol Rymer Davis, a participants in the 54th Gordon Bennett Gas Balloon Race, went missing. Officials said Wednesday that now coast guards are on the search for the pair of balloonists who was last detected piloting the balloon aircraft over the Adriatic Sea in what was reported as rough weather. Abruzzo and Davis were out to see if they can fly the farthest from a set point on a maximum of about 1,000 cubic meters, or 35,300 cubic feet, of gas, according to The Guardian. A search, which includes helicopters, three boats, and military aircraft, is now underway for the balloon, one of twenty that set off Saturday from the English coastal city of Bristol. Spokesman Lt. Massimo Maccheroni said the last signal received from the balloon's GPS was at 8 a.m. local time Wednesday. The signal showed the craft was 13 miles off the Gargano coast in the Adriatic Sea. Richard Abruzzo's sister-in-law, Sandra Abruzzo said she had been told the balloonists had suffered \"an issue with the electrical\" components in the balloon. The loss, it is speculated, could be related to that. Abruzzo is the son of famed balloonist Ben Abruzzo, who was part of the first team to cross the Pacific Ocean by balloon, in 1981. Abruzzo and Davis have competed together in the past, winning the 2006 America's Challenge gas balloon race by traveling 1,478 miles from the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.     O tem so pisali tudi na uradni strani FAI.     The bodies of the two missing American balloonists have been found today in the Adriatic Sea, off the Italian coast 10 miles north of Vieste, Italian officials say. Richard Abruzzo, 47, and Carol Rymer Davis, 65, were competing in 54th Coupe A\u00e9ronautique Gordon Bennett long-distance balloon competition out of Bristol (UK) when, after having flown approximately 1,660 km, they disappeared very early on 29 September 2010 over the Adriatic Sea in bad weather. The balloon's last tracking reports had shown it heading towards the sea at high speed. The balloon's basket with their bodies still inside was located and hauled from the water by the crew of an Italian fishing boat, an official said. "

The unforgettable trip starts a mere shout from Boka, the largest and most watery waterfall in Slovenia. At the beginning of our rafting Bovec adventure we enter the crystal clear and lingering Soca. Our special and safe dinghies are rocking with currents to the point, where the Ucje river adds some water mass to Soca and thus we gradually, albeit excitingly escalate our speed and excitement. We are always under the watchful eye of the Velika Baba mountain of Kanin. The moment we see the steep slopes of Krn, the green banks start to narrow so our experienced guides will skilfully evade the rocks and other traps together with Your help. The green flowing path begins to show off its power and the water gets stormier each passing moment of playful anticipation. The tension is ever rising and the adrenaline is flooding in our active crew, which is getting ready for the last battle with final rapids. We expertly evade the boulders, that with their might invoke awe & reverence to mother\u2019s nature miracles in humans. The raft is strongly yet relentlessly hitting the waves, so we firmly grab onto ropes before entering the final rapid and row to the bank with zeal. We\u2019re out of breath, soaking wet, slightly tired, but surely refreshingly satisfied. Our active descent is finished with disembarkment in the idyllic small village of Trnovo ob Soci.

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Bank of Slovenia Governor\u00b4s Meeting with a European Commissioner     04\/28\/2005 \/ Press release     Today, Mr. Mitja Gaspari, the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, accorded a welcome to Mr. Joaquin Almunio, the European Commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, who is paying a 2-day visit to Slovenia. Holding their discussion, they exchanged standing points and opinions with reference to the planned adoption of the euro in Slovenia, economic conditions in the European Union and in the euro area, as well as with reference to the change management concerning the Stability and Growth Pact. Governor Mr. Mitja Gaspari gave a presentation to the European Commissioner regarding Slovenia\u00b4s planned activities on her way to entry into the Eurosystem and regarding the latest projections drawn up by the Bank of Slovenia of the future economic and monetary developments. As he emphasised, the exchange rate has been stable after Slovenia\u00b4s entry into ERMII, and the projections of the future economic and monetary developments show that Slovenia could, should there be no significant deviation from the goals set, adopt the euro at the beginning of 2007, as it is envisaged.

Most often, documents are delivered to us electronically and we also accept documents sent by post or fax. Once the translation text is finalised and the file completed, we email it back to the client or send it by fax or post.     Notarised and certified translation     Notarised (also referred to as certified, official, court or sworn) translations are documents prepared in paper form which are stamped with the official seal of the certified translator. The original document, its translated version and the translator\u2019s statement on accuracy and correctness of the translated text are bound together with the Slovenian national string and sealed at the back. This gives the translation a status of an official document. Such certification is legally valid and permitted only by a translator, sworn-in by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Slovenia. Sarah Cooper, the head of Cooper Translations holds such certification powers. When do you require a notarised translation?     Once the translation document is certified we most often send it to the client via post or express delivery. Often such certified translations are required to be filed with a particular government office or a regulative body in Slovenia in which case we can provide filing service as well.     Free translation     If you have a document in Slovenian and do not know what it is, we are happy to tell you its title and the brief content for free!

      "text":" Gran Paradiso\u2014the great paradise among ibex and marmots     Literally. We found ourselves in the middle of those mighty mountains completely unexpectedly. We were considering going on holiday the last week of July and the first week of August (a few years back, though) and due to forecasts of heavy rain we changed the initially planned direction towards the Dolomites at the last minute, basically right before leaving home, and decided to go \"a bit\" further, to Gran Paradiso. We knew that the park was wonderful, the many photos we\u2019d seen of it had been encouraging us to visit it for a long time, and so the decision wasn\u2019t even that surprising.     The goal wasn\u2019t as much mountaineering in the sense of conquering the highest peaks, but more of the \u201cwandering and photographing\u201d sort as I like to say: with plenty of walking around hills and valleys and a good amount of taking photos and of course intensely experiencing the beautiful nature.     And we had all of the above in abundance. We set up our tent in the camp and then discovered hairpin bends, first by car that occasionally made some puffing noises, and then on foot. The mighty summits reigned over by ibex were inviting. The Gran Paradiso National Park is not known only for its mighty peak of the same name reaching 4061 metres but also for ibex. Gran Paradiso is also where the ibex living in our Julian Alps originate; they were brought to the valley of Zadnjica after 1965. Sharp verticals, patches of colourful soft pillows of mountain flowers and herbs. Somewhere in between, the wind brings along the calls of eagles, marmots and ibex.     \u201cIt really is paradise-like,\u201d Stane and I quietly exclaimed to ourselves and out loud. You know how it is, sharing a pleasant experience with our loved ones multiplies it at least a thousand fold. This was also true in this case. Invisible threads were weaving together earthly reality and imaginary world \u2026 Indeed, the mountains are precisely that holy place where time and time again legends are born about gods and heroes, mythical creatures, and along with them those about the creation and the end of the world. They emerge from unspoiled nature, inaccessibility or difficult access to this wild world and from the awe of humans who use their imagination to depict this special bond and feelings using the language of various arts too.     A thought by Roland Dellagiacoma comes to mind: \u201cHigh mountains always reminded me that high above them or deep inside of them, above the highest peak and under the lowest chasm, anywhere and everywhere, lies a big secret: the limit of what is allowed, the limit of our capabilities and the limit of the last realization.\u201d     My heart nods. How could it not, next to this magnificent kingdom of the mountain world.     We did have some luck with ibex, but the big ones prefer staying higher up during the summer, whereas another type of sound can be heard much beyond the tree line but in the grassier areas of the park. You\u2019re on the lookout for them and then you see, appearing from out of the grass in front of you, a furry head curiously observing the surroundings of its burrow. No, these aren\u2019t bears, even though they too like sleeping through the winter. Of course, we\u2019re talking about marmots. However, these ones are not wrapping Milka chocolate.     Sometimes they casually rest in front of their burrows, but in reality they are alert and notice every little rustle near or far. And when they sense danger, they immediately stand up on hind legs, raise their head high up in the air and warn their entire nearby community with shrill whistles. Soon after, others do the same and hide inside their burrows until the danger passes.     We zigzagged among marmots, mountains, waterfalls, peaks and ibex for a bit more than a fortnight. Not long enough to see all the views and do all the walking, but the impressions are strong enough and so we\u2019re already picking dates for returning in autumn. Perhaps we should take a peek from the French side as well, climb to reach other views or refresh ourselves by looking at lovely lakes, but also feel the vibe of the mountain wilderness during a slightly less touristy season. Until next time.     Petra Dra\u0161kovi\u010d Pelc     Born in the Slovene \u0160tajerska, she chose to live in Ko\u010devje and the mere thought of adventures in the wild nature of Alaska gets her heart racing like a wild animal. She enjoys silence, peace and the beauty of the light-flooded wilds of all the untouched corners of the world, as well as the beauty of her local Ko\u010devje-area and Slovenia. She is an enthusiastic traveler, a curious admirer of nature, a tourist guide, author of countless articles in Slovenia as well as abroad and a doctor in biomedical science, who found her calling in (natural scientific) photography. Throughout her work with ARS NATURAE she tries to express love towards nature and its preservation. "

Po pregledu ponudbe in primerjav razli\u010dnih navigacij preko internetne strani, sem hitro izbral ustrezno navigacijo in jo prejel v 2 dnevih.     Janez iz Ko\u010devja     V podjetju Gepoint se zavedamo, da je za pravilno uporabo navigacije potrebno nekaj \u010dasa in truda. Da bi vam to olaj\u0161ali smo uvedli celovite te\u010daje, ki smo jih razdelili v dva dela in sicer:     What is it?     The Farmnavigator Auto-steering System controls your vehicle steering, and helps you stay on track following with great precision the guide lines set on the Farmnavigator.     This way, you can switch from the \u201clight bar\u201d system to automatic driving, meaning you can focus on controlling the implements instead of worrying about the steering wheel, which improves the quality and effectiveness of the job. Such a system is very useful in scarce visibility conditions, in case of fog and dusty fields.     You can disengage the auto steering by firmly grasping the steering wheel; vice versa you can engage it very easily by tapping the corresponding icon on the Farmnavigator display.     All the advantages of Automatic Steering     The Farmnavigator Auto-steering System allows you using the whole length of your implements, maximizing the crop area and reducing overlapping. This system saves you time (as the headland maneuvers will be faster) and saves you money, reducing waste of fuel, seeds and fertilizers. This results in a quantitative and qualitative improvement of your crop, and a higher return on investment.

For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

      "text":" Dr Janez Drnov\u00b9ek: Some Good May Come Of The Uproar Over Austria     Published in European Affairs, Volume 1, No3, Summer 2000, European Institute (\u00e8lanek je v angle\u00b9kem jeziku)     The entry into the Austrian government of the extreme right Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider provoked controversy throughout Europe this spring. The hasty reaction of Austria's 14 partners in the European Union, who decided to freeze bilateral political relations with Vienna, was applauded by some, criticized by others. Some of the 14 countries are now having second thoughts. What is actually happening in Austria and in Europe? Are fundamental European democratic values under threat? Is what has happened in Austria so special and dramatic as to have warranted the EU's unprecedented response? For some, the Freedom Party represents a step backwards, reminiscent of the events that occurred before and during World War II. The first question is whether 27 per cent of the Austrian electorate supported Haider because of statements he has made about National Socialism, which he later corrected or denied, or because of his hostile attitude towards foreigners and minorities? Many political parties are in trouble Judging by the reaction of politicians in the other 14 countries, one might think that this is exactly what they did, and that there is a danger that these retrograde tendencies will gain ascendancy in Austria and spread to other European countries. That could present a grave danger to the EU and to its democratic development and stability. Critics say that Austrians have never fully come to terms with Nazism and World War II. If this is the case, the warnings of the international community would be fully justified. Many others, however, believe that the Freedom Party achieved its electoral success above all because of the weaknesses of the two traditional governing parties, which had failed to prevent the rise of right-wing populism. More than anything, it would appear that Haider exploited the political and bureaucratic inertia of the Austrian establishment, successfully challenging it with populist rhetoric. A substantial number of voters were perhaps taking a stand against political inertia and incompetence rather than supporting a clearly defined political alternative. Although the two major political parties in Austria had secured solid progress and a relatively high standard of living for the country during their long period in power, they also allowed a lack of political motivation to grow. The sharing out of political and official positions between the two parties, the constant battling for every millimetre of influence and the occasional political scandals allowed room for dissatisfaction and exasperation to develop. Perhaps it is on this point that the reaction of Europe's politicians is even more understandable. There may be a conscious or unconscious fear of similar populist exploitation of political paralysis in other European countries. Many traditional European parties are in difficulty, shaken by corruption scandals, often rigid and perhaps incapable of adapting to people's expectations and demands. The European institutions in Brussels are themselves under increasing pressure as demands grow for improved transparency and efficiency. They, too, could be subject to populist attacks in the future. In many places European citizens have a sense of alienation, not only from their national governments but also, and more particularly, from Brussels. A revolt against outmoded and paralysed political parties and structures that was xenophobic, intolerant and retrograde on the one hand, and anti-bureaucratic and populist on the other, could be very dangerous. Perhaps it is precisely this that so alarmed Europe's politicians when the Austrians voted in their new government. It seems almost as if Europe needed a Haider because of the accumulated domestic fears in certain European countries. And, in the end, it is no longer important what Haider says or does today. Europe has already responded to his populism in a populist manner. Just as right-wing populists demonize either foreigners or a minority population or some external threat, today European democrats are demonizing Haider. Austria hasn't done anything wrong The paradox is that the new Austrian government has not done anything yet. It has not hurt anyone, nor violated any human rights. The stance taken by some other European countries towards foreigners is at least as restrictive as that of Austria. In many places there is a fear that EU expansion will bring with it an influx of people and workers from the East. Is the EU not increasingly becoming a fortress which non-Europeans find it harder and harder to enter? Although there is support in principle for enlargement of the EU, will the practical difficulties and conditions placed on the applicants perhaps be greater than anything so far contemplated in Austria? We have to ask what is the best way to confront the dangers of such populism and the political challenge presented by the Haider phenomenon. Is the political isolation of the Austrian government, of which the Freedom Party is part, really the right reaction? Is it better in such cases to try to prevent such governments being formed at any price? Or is it better to let them go ahead, in the expectation that their populism will lose its charm once it is confronted with reality, and that the populist politicians will become ordinary politicians who have to tackle day-to-day problems? The EU has opted for isolation and the suspension of political bilateral dialogue with the Vienna government, although Austria still participates in EU meetings. With all the accompanying political demonstrations and media attention, the Austrian situation could be an important precedent, a warning for all other similar cases. I believe that the EU's preventive action is important. The question is whether it would have been enough merely to issue a very serious warning, and then take action in specific cases if there were any violations of human rights or any other intolerant acts. Do not re-open post-War treaties Furthermore, one might ask what effect the reaction of the international community will have on Austria's internal politics, and whether it will be positive or negative. Do not the Austrians see this as unjustified meddling in their internal affairs, in the democratic decision they have taken? Another important aspect, which quite wrongly has remained in the background, is the matter of making corrections to the post-war arrangements in Europe. The Austrian coalition is raising the question of the Sudetenland Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia and ethnic Germans evicted from Slovenia, then part of Yugoslavia, after the war. Responsibility for compensating the losses incurred by Austrian citizens through the confiscation of assets on the territory of Yugoslavia was later formally assumed by the Austrian state under the provisions of the Austrian State Treaty. With this treaty Austria was bound to compensate its citizens for damages incurred, instead of paying war reparations to Yugoslavia.Trying to revise these arrangements could jeopardize the basis of the European international system - and yet, that is exactly what the Austrian coalition has been doing. The reopening of post-war issues that had been settled by international treaties has a precedent from the period of the right-wing Italian government of 1994 and 1995. At that time the Italian government demanded that Slovenia return property that had been nationalized after the war, even though the matter had been settled with the Osimo and Rome accords between Italy and Yugoslavia and financial compensation had been paid. The Italians linked the acceptance of the Association Agreement between Slovenia and the EU to the return of this property. That was in effect an attempt to correct the post-war legal arrangements. For two years Italy blocked the signing of the Association Agreement and Slovenia's potential accession to the EU. But the EU did not react to this reopening of post-war historical issues or to the link with EU accession. It was only when a new Italian government, headed by Romano Prodi, came to power that we were able to resolve the issue by means of a compromise involving the gradual opening up of the property market in Slovenia, while Italy lifted its objections to Slovenia joining the EU. The EU did not react to a very clear case of linkage and blackmail. At the time we warned strongly of the danger of allowing such a precedent to be set, that it could spread to other cases (German-Czech, Czech-Austrian or German-Polish relations), and that compensation had been provided by treaties, which had also settled border issues and other vital matters. This is why the reopening of post-war legal arrangements is such a dangerous road to go down and, moreover, conflicts with the very foundations on which the EU is built. Nazism and fascism in World War II caused untold suffering and horror, and maybe the legal arrangements imposed by the victors after the war are not equitable in every little detail. But reopening these questions introduces tension into European relations, opens old wounds, and incites the old emotions to flare once again. When the EU considers the actual policies of the new Austrian government, it would be well advised to give special attention to this issue, and to head off any direct or indirect inclusion of such questions in the enlargement negotiations. If the countries concerned are able to resolve any questions that remain open, then they should do so bilaterally. EU member-states should not attempt to block or slow down the entry of an applicant country, which may then be forced into making unjustified concessions. Genocide is still possible today All this shows that there is a very thin line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in the EU, and that this line is movable. It is quite clear that playing with ideas and emotions that are not so very far from Nazism, fascism or revanchism is unacceptable. This is the most solid point of the European response to Haider. The horrors of World War II must not be repeated at any price. The Yugoslav war provides all the proof we need that today's Europe is not immune to such events. Ethnic cleansing, the slaughter of people from different ethnic backgrounds, genocide - it is all still possible today. The nations of Yugoslavia were not at a level of culture or civilization so very different from that of many other European countries. Policies based on the establishment of either a Greater Serbia or a Greater Germany lead to catastrophe. Politicians who incite such emotions, who seek to repair historical injustices committed against their people, are playing with fire. Sooner or later the flames will take hold. This is why preventive action and reaction make sense, even if they are excessive as in the Austrian case. It is better than not reacting at all. On these issues, Europe and the wider international community must be firm and decisive. A fear of foreigners Another issue is attitudes towards foreigners. Tolerance is one of the fundamental democratic European values. Yet intolerance of foreigners is a common phenomenon in European countries. The EU itself (and some individual countries even more so) is introducing a range of restrictive measures aimed at limiting immigration. Hence the flow of people, and especially workers, between the EU countries and the rest of Europe, including certain EU applicants, is becoming a major problem. Europe is taking preventive measures because of the fear that at some point a spontaneous reaction will occur when a certain threshold of immigration is exceeded. The problem is compounded when politicians stir up emotions and hostile reactions towards immigrants. While most European politicians continue to express their tolerance of foreigners, minorities and different religious groups, a ways must be found of ensuring that practical reactions to the problems of immigration are consistent with these principles. This will be one of the more difficult tasks facing the European Union and Europe as a whole in the future. The issue is intimately linked to the enlargement process. The EU must gradually expand and take in those parts of Europe that have the same goals and values. If part of Europe were to be excluded, and a sharp boundary created between the EU and the rest of Europe, the line between stability and instability would cause new tensions and threats. This is a difficult and very important issue for the future of Europe. The EU has slowed down the enlargement process and tightened the conditions for applicants because it is concerned about its own absorption capacities. But anyone who seeks to develop from this a policy against EU expansion - against foreigners - begins to threaten the very foundations of the European idea. Another issue is that of the transparency and effectiveness of the workings of the democratic structures in the EU countries, and particularly in the EU itself. Anti-bureaucratic populism may be hard to distinguish from normal pressures for greater effectiveness and transparency. It is in the nature of a democracy that the opposition will always look for errors and seek to exert pressure, and it may do so in a way that is populist - it may simplify things and it may be entirely unrealistic. This usually becomes evident once such politicians or parties enter government themselves and are confronted with reality. Here again Europe's politicians and bureaucrats face a difficult task. A constant battle for greater effectiveness and transparency will need to be fought. If not, sooner or later, politicians offering a program directed against the EU, against its alleged alienation of ordinary people, its lack of transparency and its bureaucratic inefficiency, will be victorious in one of the member countries. Haider may no longer be the official leader of the Freedom Party. But he has shown himself capable of exploiting populism, the mistakes of the establishment, and the sluggishness of politics. But his goals are probably not extreme. In a way he has been making them up as he goes along. He has even begun to renounce them, probably partly as a result of the European reaction. Difficult task for Europe He has highlighted a danger, and many Europeans have been shaken by fear. But some good may come of it. Events in Austria, and the reaction to them, have given all European politicians an opportunity to reflect seriously on our values, goals and policies. "

Additionally to the built-in parsers, you can find more of them on ParserMarket.     1. How Parsers are applied     A parser reads some portion of text, analyzes it and creates some specially formatted output from it. You can choose the parser to use using 2 different techniques:     A #format processing instruction     A #format processing instruction can be used to tell MoinMoin which parser to use for the whole page content. By default this is the wiki parser (for moin wiki markup). For details see: The #format Processing Instruction     A Parser section - see HelpOnFormatting With the use of a parser section, a parser can be applied to only a part of a page. You specify which parser to call by using a shebang-like construct in the first line. A shebang is a concept known from Unix command line scripts, where they serve the exact same purpose: the first line tells the shell what program to start to process the remaining lines of the script.     1.1. Example: Processing instruction     1.2. Example: Parser section     1.3. Parser sections and nesting     Please note that there are 2 ways to solve nesting problems related to }}}:     Use more than 3 curly braces for beginning \/ ending of the parser section (what you use must not be contained in the section you are enclosing). E.g.:     Use 3 curly braces + some unique string:     For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing.     2. Parsers for writing text content     Some of the parsers are intended for writing normal page text (like e.g. a document):     wiki \u2013 the standard moin wiki parser, see HelpOnMoinWikiSyntax     creole \u2013 the creole wiki markup parser, see HelpOnCreoleSyntax     3. csv parser     The CSV parser works on so-called comma separated values, though the comma is now usually and by default a semicolon. The first line is considered to contain column titles that are rendered in bold, so when you don't want table headers, leave the first line empty.     The shebang can contain the following arguments:     delimiter or separator: delimiter=, will set the delimiter to a comma     quotechar: quotechar=\" will allow quoting values with a double-quote     show: comma-separated list of columns to show only     hide: comma-separated list of columns to hide     autofilter: comma-separated list of columns to add auto-filters on     name: name of the dataset     link: comma-separated list of columns consisting of http:\/\/example.com\/link description text rather than just text     static_cols, static_vals: columns (and respective values) added to each record     -N (where N is a number): hide column N (useful when column names are omitted)     The parser also supports the old, deprecated syntax for the shebang.     Example (please see the raw text of this page for the markup used):     These parsers were provided with MoinMoin versions < 1.9 using a moin-specific parsing \/ syntax highlighting implementation. Since MoinMoin 1.9 these parsers are just shortcuts, calling the highlight parser (see below).     5. highlight parser     MoinMoin comes with a special parser called highlight that uses Pygments internally.     You can use it to highlight many sorts of programming source code, configuration files and other sorts of text files used on computers (just use the corresponding Lexer name from the table below).     Usage:     renders as:     Of course you can also use it for a complete page as a processing instruction, e.g.: #format highlight python     5.1. Arguments     The highlight parser accepts arguments for line numbering:     numbers= might be on, off, or disable and defaults to on. on or off means that line numbers are switchable via JavaScript (html formatter). disabled means that line numbers are disabled completely.     start= must be a non negative number and defaults to 1,     step= must be a non negative number and defaults to 1.     Usage:     renders as: "

      "text":" History     The Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television has been a member of the University of Ljubljana since 1975.     It was in 1945, when the National Government of Slovenia founded Academy of Drama Arts by its decree. This was the first higher education institution of theatre training in former Yugoslavia. It began to operate in March 1946. In 1949 it was moved from its premises at \u0160tefanova ulica in Ljubljana to three floors of a nationalised monastery at 3, Nazorjeva ulica (basement, ground floor and a section of the 1st floor).     In 1963, however, The Academy of Drama Arts was renamed to become the Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television. It operated as an independent, rector-led higher education institution until 1975.     The needs of audio-visual media called for an expansion of the Academy\u2019s curriculum from theatre to other related, and yet independent fields. In the early years these consisted mainly of film and radio, and later on television studires. The Academy gradually established a vibrant production of student films, as well as radio and television shows.     UL AGRFT is the only higher education institution in Slovenia offering university-level training for professions in theatre, film, radio and television. In 2014, the bulk of the Academy\u2019s activities were moved to its new premises at Trubarjeva cesta. For the first time since its foundation, persistent efforts made by the Academy\u2019s direction to solve the issue of its premises were partially met. Today, the Academy implements teaching process at rented premises at Nazorjeva ulica, Trubarjeva cesta and Kvedrova ulica, as well as in rented production spaces in public and private theatre houses. The Academy\u2019s efforts regarding the issue of its premises remain directed towards ensuring a suitable and permanent solution. "

Artists     Brad Downey     03.06.2020 18:49     Brad Downey (1980, Louisville, Kentucky) can best be described as a conceptual artist and the most famous stranger. Downey, a master of fine arts and sculpture, developed his skills at the Slade School of Art under the mentorship of Bruce McLean. In 1998, at the Pratt Institute's initiative, he decided to continue his life in New York. Downey's projects distort the habits and conventions of the urban environment and cast doubt on norms that are so firmly embedded in society that it perceives them as real and appropriate rather than restrictive and invasive. The lack of discourse and dialogue is a theme that Downey touches in each of his works. These question customs and moral values and encourage viewers to re-evaluate their environment.     He has exhibited at venues such as Tate Modern, the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in the USA, the Kunsthalle Dominikanerkirche in Osnabr\u00fcck, the Kunstcentret Silkeborg Bad in Denmark and others. He also made several free, mass works of art outside the enclosed exhibition space. He has been creating his radical and inspiring works worldwide for the last two decades, and in recent years he has been working mainly in Berlin.     He found himself in Slovenia for the first time almost by accident, after a call from a Ukrainian friend who was interested in coming to Slovenia for a haircut. Downey responded to the invitation and, together with other participants, attended the Fotopub festival in Novo mesto. All of them were a part of the group show with the same hairstyle.     During the exhibition, he got the idea to explore the homeland of Melania Trump, whose work and life he followed from the migrant perspective. Being an American who is no stranger to the European perspective, he felt a responsibility to explore the environment in which she grew up. His idea was carved into a wooden statue of Melania Trump with a chainsaw by Ale\u0161 \u017dupevc - Maxi. It is located near Sevnica.     Melania's copy was exhibited in Berlin and the Ljubljana V\u017eigalica Gallery. The story also received overseas media attention, CNN, and some other media houses. He now wants to add a new kind of cultural value to Melania's work and analyze the depth of artistic creation.     He returned to Slovenia often, most recently before the start of quarantine due to the positive experience. He wanted to stay here only for a few days due to some works of art, which soon turned into months due to the epidemiological situation. Thus, he remained trapped in Slovenia with projects that were already underway and were given a new form. At the same time, the environment of Izola, where he lived, inspired him to such an extent that he managed to create new works and as part of our project residence, collaborating with CO Nanocentar, name: intermedia artist Marko Vivoda, Rok Pahor, and others.     One of the results of the collaboration with the CO Nanocenter is the work Space on a Grain of Sand. The idea was to carve into the smallest unit still suitable for processing, and that was a grain of sand from Santa Barbara, California. With the help of a colleague from the CO Nanocentre Bojan Ambro\u017ei\u010d, using a focused ion beam, they \"carved\" an image from a Sumerian stone tablet on grains of sand. The second project is still ongoing. As part of this, they are restoring important foreign work of art from a layer of a painted wall using X-rays and infrared images.     There are new projects on the horizon, inspired by the community he lived in, artists and friends whom he made new acquaintances with, and created various artistic projects.

      "text":" Seminar iz kriptografije in teorije kodiranja - 6. okt. 2005     On Design and Security of Modern Stream Ciphers     Enes Pa\u0161ali\u0107     Povzetek:     In a modern society cryptology plays a fundamental role in many public services that demand privacy in data communication. Its wide range of use covers the services such as internet banking, mobile communication encryption, e-mail encryption ...., to name just a few. One huge subclass of cryptographic primitives consists of so called symmetric-key ciphers which in itself contains block ciphers and stream ciphers. These encryption schemes are used for a fast symmetric-key encryption, that is the same secret key is shared by the sender and receiver in a two-party communication. A few years ago, a new block cipher standard was adopted (Advanced Encryption Standard that uses the Rijndael encryption algorithm) as a replacement of the famous block cipher DES. Stream cipher encryption technique has not yet been standardized except of certain mobile applications such as GSM. Due to faster encryption when compared to block ciphers, this encryption method still remains attractive for fast encryption applications where a huge amount of data is to be encrypted. Also, some real-time applications such as encryption of streaming video sequence are preferably performed in an extremely fast fashion. In this talk we discuss general design strategies for modern stream cipher schemes. The security aspects of certain design approaches are illustrated. In the second part, the concept of algebraic attacks is treated in greater depth. These attacks, being a relatively new security threat, have in certain sense compromised the security of many encryption schemes that were believed to be cryptographically strong. "

      "text":" The study will examine the economic and social conditions in the Slovenian part of the Habsburg monarchy during transition from feudalism to capitalism. The main studied period will be the one between the end of Illyric provinces in 1813 and the stock market breakdown in 1873. The essential focus will be on the economic and social changes, caused by the transition from one political and economic system to the other. The multi-layered impact of a predominantly rural society's transition into the post-feudal or pre-industrial and industrial society will interest us from the perspective of the majority rural population, as well as from the perspective of the emerging proletariat. Economic and social changes will be demonstrated by a series of case studies. Individual studies will examine (a) economic causes for the deterioration of the rural population's situation, (b) economic effects of railway network construction and its impact on industrialization, with special focus on the role of Slovenian businessmen, (c) social consequences of transition on the example of a large increase in alcohol consumption, (d) hygienic conditions of city and rural proletariat and (e) medico-social changes on the example of transformation of the public healthcare network due to the extinction of the healer profession and the establishment of \"bratovske skladnice\" (fraterneties' funds) as a new form of medico-social care to meet the needs of the emerging industrial workers' class. The research will be predominantly based on archival material of the state, provincial, district and communal level, held by the Slovenian and Austrian archives. Other sources such as topographies, administrative indexes (\u0161ematizmi) and newspapers will, among others, contribute to the study. Due to the fact that the Slovenian historiography until the present did not study economic and even more social history of the first capitalist transition, the research will have an essential impact on this segment of history of the 19th century. Moreover, it will raise interest in social and economic history that is, compared to political history, under-represented in the Slovenian historiography.

Based on the recommendations of the National Institute of Public Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) and our medical staff, we have enhanced our cleanliness and hygiene measures in order to ensure you feel safe and comfortable at Terme Vivat.     Below are the measures we have taken:     RECEPTION AND LOBBY     The prescribed safety distance between individuals that wait in front of the reception is at least 1.5 m. The proper distance is indicated by the floor markings on the floor.     Hand disinfectants are installed at the reception and in the hotel lobby.     An automatic body temperature meter is installed at the reception.     We regularly disinfect work surfaces.     We ventilate the area several times a day.     We recommend non-cash payment.     Room access cards are disinfected for each guest and handed over to the guest in a safe manner.     It is compulsory to wear a mask in the restaurant, in the toilets, in public areas (lobby, hallways), in the Thai massage salon and in the wellness center.     Guests are assigned meal times and check-out times.     We recommend that you only take the elevator alone or, if possible, take the stairs (the latter also contributes to your well-being).     Receptionists wear protective face masks.     We have removed various printed materials. We will gladly present them to you at your request.     GUEST ARRIVAL AND HOTEL ROOM     Guests receive disinfected towels and room access cards upon arrival.     Each room is thoroughly cleaned, ventilated and disinfected before the arrival of a new guest.     In hotel rooms, we pay special attention to the most-touched areas \u2013 we clean, ventilate and disinfect them even more thoroughly.     We removed all the decorative elements on the upholstered furniture and bed.     In case of a multi-day stay in the accommodation unit, the guest decides whether he wants the staff to perform daily cleaning.     Bed linen, towels and bathrobes are cleaned according to the recommendations.     Housekeeping staff wears protective face masks and gloves.     FOOD SERVICE     Tables in restaurants are set at a distance of 3 m.     We recommend that guests maintain sufficient interpersonal distance of 1.5 m and protect themselves with face masks.     Hand disinfectants are installed in front of restaurant and restroom entrances.     We regularly disinfect all common and work surfaces, tables and chairs.

      "text":" Masculine Penetrating - Ezra Pound     Geun Young Jang English and French Feminist Approaches to Pound's Poetics (Part 3)*     The father is dead, yet, for Pound, the past and its language is of much importance, for he can identify himself with the phallic signifier only through the fusion of the past and the present. However, the present is the unpoetic and feminized age In the line, \"For an old bitch gone in the teeth,\" of Hugh Selwyn Mauberley, Pound describes that the age demanded\" is the abominable and decrepit feminine (HSM 176). Here, as in the pejorative term, an old bitch representing a botched civilization, which takes young artists' life, is sexed as female. Pound's abhorrence to the old woman is also, in particular, manifested in his article, \"Suffragettes.\" Even though he proclaims that \"their [women's] demand is irrevocably just,\" in this case Pound paradoxically notes that \"Politics is unfit for men,\" and that \"it may be good enough for women, we doubt it\" (369, 370). Pound concludes, thus, \"The Male mind does not want a state run by women or by 'old women'\" (370), and one of the old women is the \"old bitch,\" \"a botched civilization.\" Here, as Bruce Clarke defined, this crone figure, \"an old bitch gone in the teeth,\" is similar to \"woman transformed by fertility and motherhood, metamorphosed by natural commerce with an aging and procreating body, and then, thrown away, rejected from the house\" (Allegories 146). Then, in his endnote, Clarke details this logic of the crone as the abject mother who \"shares the lost landscape of metamorphic allegory with the phallic mother\" (Allegories 177 n. 31). However, in this context, even though, by using the very pejorative term, indicating some victimization, \"an old bitch,\" seems, rather than the abject mother, to imply the omnipotent, phallic mother.[17] In The Freudian Mystique, Samual Slipp defines the \"omnipotent preoedipal mother\" as follows     To cope with its helplessness in very early childhood, the infant needs to empower the mother by projecting a fantasy of omnipotence and merging with her. We could hypothesize that this merged symbiotic relationship with the preoedipal mother, which occurs during each person's childhood, was externalized onto the goddess in early societies to provide a sense of security. Like the omnipotent preoedipal mother, the great mother goddess was perceived as all powerful over life and death (29-30).     Ezra Pound, arrested.     For Lacanian psychoanalysis, \"the imaginary\" means to describe \"the preoedipal identification of the infant with its mirror image\", at this stage in its development, the child is neither feminine nor masculine (Weedon 51). The child's helpless dependence on its mother at the preoedipal stage without distinct sexual identifications renders the omnipotent mother as \"the great mother goddess perceived as all powerful over life and death.\" In Pound's poetics, the omnipotent phallic mother is abhortent, yet persistently present in that he cannot break from the tie with the mother, and. in this instance, the mother\u2014perhaps preoedipal\u2014can represent his softness rooted in the Nineties In addition, the blurring of gender is also occasioned with the preoedipal mother, for in the preoedipal mother-child dyad gender identifications cannot occur. The Eleusinian myth\u2014which seems dominant in later Cantos\u2014may indicate Pound's inability to enter into the symbolic in terms reminiscent of Demeter, who can represent the omnipotent preoedipal mother; she brings Fall and Winter which symbolize the spiritual death and seems to have the power over life and death.     Ezra Pound, Prolegomena 1: How to Read, Toulon , 1932.     Perhaps, Pound's masks are devices for escaping the reign of the phallic and hostile mother. However, these masks are definitely indicating the locus of the in between of the subject and the object. Of masks, young Pound writes:     Therefore, asking you to pardon what is yet imperfect, looking rather to what I have striven to express than to the technicalities and minutiae of that expression, I give you that part of me which is most real, fartherest distilled most removed from the transient personality, (Persona, a mask), most nearly related to things that more [sic] permanent than this smoke wraith the earth (\"Letters to 'Viola Baxter Jordan\" 109).     Quoting this paragraph, Maud Ellmann notes that \"Pound begins to advocate impersonality as early as 1907, at the same time that he clings to a subjectivist aesthetic (139) The poetics of the in-between of subjectivity and objectivity may be, then, said to be presented in the use of the persona While the persona or mask can be a method of impersonality to get objectivity, at the same time, this masquerade is, for Pound, surely the expression of the inner self A sincere expression of the self, the mask, is implicating the myth as strange, unfamiliar, and, moreover, hostile:     These tales of old disguisings are they not myths of souls that found themselves among Unwonted folk that spake an hostile tongue. Some soul from all the rest who'd not forget The star-span acres of a former lot Where boundless mid the clouds his course he swung. Or carnate with his elder brothers sung Ere ballad-makers lisped of Camelot? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . All they that with strange sadness in their eyes Ponder in silence o'er earth's queynt devyse? (\"Masks,\" CEP 34)     In particular, on the first three lines, Ellmann comments that \"Pound speculates that myths like these evolved as masks to screen their own creators\" (142). The masks\u2014 myths\u2014as screens or disguisings are, thus, alienated, split from their own creator, and they are intricate forms of \"queynt devyse.\" With \"strange sadness,\" Pound's mythic metamorphoses of personae show the distance between masks and their own creator. Originally, as Donald Davie says, the mask is a Yeatsian term (82). Such critics as Christ and Marianne Korn consider Pound's masks as deriving from his Romanticism Christ argues that the \"mask serves both Pound and Yeats as a defense against those limitations which they felt the age placed upon the voice and the tradition to which the artist could lay claim\" (41). In other words, as a method to escape from the hostile, limited world, personae and the search for masks provide the creator with an unbounded, unlimited possibility of going beyond through multiplicity and fluidities of identities in terms of wearing masks. Consistent with Christ, Korn places Pound in the continuity of Romantic tradition from Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Shelly, for Pound\u2019s Masks \"shows\u201d a portrait of the artist as a social outcast, alienated by his very nature from the very world\". Moreover, Korn says that young Pound's attitude is rather a romantic Bohemian's (14) Korn writes:     It is this kind of statement that has led critics to comment on the passivity of the poetic experience which is described in these early years, as opposed to an energetic, form-making imagination which becomes central to Vorticist theory five years later. (15)     According to Korn, Pound's experiment with the masks seems to be passive, but opposed to the energy-seeking poetics of Vorticist theory. While we can see later Pound's poetics as seeking for hardness, in this respect, early Pound's poetics of passivity might be seen as the poetics of softness in terms of the Decadent.     In \"Und Drang,\" the last lines of section 'VIII, \"The Flame,\" Pound describes the self as eluding a fixed identity:     If I have merged my soul, or utterly Am solved and bound in, through aught here on earth. There canst thou find me, 0 thou anxious thou. Who call'st about my gates for some lost me; I say my soul flowed back, became translucent. Search not my lips, O Love, let go my hands. This thing that moves as man is no more mortal If thou hast seen that mirror of all moments, That glass to all things that o'ershadow it Call not that mirror me, for I have slipped Your grasp, I have eluded. (CEP 172)     Ellmann notes, \"Rather than endangering the self. Pound revels in its gateway, as it its slippage were the source of its resilience, \"and\u201d It seems that he denies the self only to restore it elsewhere, in another guise\" (143) Ellmann also sees Pound's self-denial or annihilation in his use of persona as a method to get his resilience to become a vehicle for his variable and multiple identifications with \"you\" the mythical and past masculine heroes; self-annihilation becomes the restoration of the elastic self In Pound's \"Histrion,\" this self becomes a receptacle or receptive vehicle.     No man hath dared to write this thing as yet. And yet I know, how that the souls of all men great At times pass through us. And we are melted into them, and are not Save reflexions of their souls. Thus am I Dante for a space and am One Fran9ois Villon, ballad-lord and thief Or am such holy ones I may not write. Lest blasphemy be writ against my name; This for an instant and the flame is gone.     'Tis as in midmost us there glows a sphere Translucent, molten gold, that is the \"F' And into this some form projects itself Christus, or John, or eke the Florentine; And as the clear space is not if a form's Imposed thereon, So cease we from all being for the time. And these, the Masters of the Soul, live on. (71)     The Eyes Turn Topaz     The mirror almost always serves to reduce us to a pure exteriority -of a very particular kind. It functions as a possible way to constitute screens between the other and myself In a way quite different from the mucous membranes of the skin that serve as living, porous, fluid media to achieve communion as well as difference, the mirror is a frozen\u2014and polemical\u2014weapon to keep us apart. (Irigaray, Sexes and Genealogies 65)     As I have discussed earlier, the light, that is, the gaze is closely related to the traditional metaphoric use of mirroring. While the mirror can mean the patriarchal frame as well as the subversive, transgressive tool through the miming, the light, the gaze seems to be associated with the Image through its rigorous visual immediacy. As Elizabeth Hirsh has indicated, thus, the Image is in close connection with the relation of the eye and I, \"specularization\" and \"speculation\" (141-3). According to Hirsh the \"image\" and the \"imagery\" evokes imaginative perception or sensation\u2014a \"synedoche which itself implies the subordination of the sensory manifold under hegemony of a single eye\"; the word. Image, by its bearing of a capital \"I.\" is coined by, that famous egotist, Ezra Pound, and marked by the poetic father's seal (143).     In Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty says, \"to look at an object is to inhabit it, and from this habitation to grasp all things in terms of the aspect which they present to it\" (68). Moreover, this relation between the viewer and the object is that of the master and the slave, the self and the other: \"Shame and immodesty, then, take their place in a dialectic of the self and the other which is that of master and slave: in so far as I have a body, I may be reduced to the status of an object beneath the gaze of another person, and no longer count as a person for him, or else 1 may become his master and. in my turn, look at him\u00ab (Merleau-Ponty 167). At this point, Butler argues Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception as an expression of sexual ideology while she notes the significance of the \"prevalence of visual metaphors in Merleau-Ponty's descriptions of normal sexuality\", \"Indeed, it sometimes appears as if sexuality itself were reduced to the erotics of the gaze\" (\"Sexual Ideology\" 93) Further, Butler argues, \"the body\" Merleau-Ponty perceives is female, and the \"normal subject\" is male (\"Sexual Ideology\" 93) Butler writes:     Although Merleau-Ponty does not equate the master with the male body or the slave with the female body, he does tend, as we have seen, to identify the female body with a sexual schema of a decontextualized and fragmented body. Read in light of Simone de Beauvoir's later claim in The Second Sex, that women are culturally constructed as the Other, reduced to their bodies and, further, to their sex, to Merleau-Ponty's description of the \"metaphysical\" structure of bodily existence appears to encode and reify that specific cultural dynamic of heterosexual relations. (\"Sexual Ideology \"9\")     Woman as the other, the body, is the reified object, matter, and this binary opposite of form and matter originates with Aristotle. Irigaray criticizes Plato's form\/matter distinction, this binary opposition and the exclusion of the feminine matter from Western metaphysical discourse in, \"Plato's Hysteria\" in Speculum. According to Butler' reading of Merleau-Ponty and Irigaray, Merleau-Ponty's notion of sexuality and the body, though fragmented and reified, is the feminine, not the masculine. Here, borrowing Irigaray's notion of materiality, Butler is making a distinction between matter and materiality     Inasmuch as a distinction between form and matter is offered within phallogocentrism, it is articulated through a further materiality In other words, every explicit distinction takes place in an inscriptional space that the distinction itself cannot accommodate. Matter as a site of inscription cannot be explicitly thematized. And this inscriptional site or space is, for Irigaray, a materiality that is not the same as the category of \"matter\" whose articulation it conditions and enables. It is this unthematizable materiality that Irigaray claims becomes the site, the repository, indeed, the receptacle of and for the feminine within a phallogocentric economy. (Bodies 38)     For Butler's reading of Irigaray's notion of matter, matter imposed upon by phallogocentrism is unthematizable. Rather, the materiality of the feminine becomes the site, \"the repository,\" and \"the receptacle\" within a phallogocentric economy because matter is excluded from the discourse. In other words, not outside, but within phallogocentrism, Irigaray's materiality is one part of her miming strategy of becoming against and within phallogocentrism.     Considering man's eye as substitute for the penis, moreover, Irigaray states, man's eye will \"be able to prospect woman's sexual parts, seek there new sources of profit\" and, further, in this theoretical process, \"man fetishizes (his) desire\" (S 145), desire and the gaze is, thus, masculine in that through the masculine gaze femininity is fetishized.[18] However, the male exploration of the feminine is vain because there still remains the realm of mystery, the dark continent of the feminine, the hysteric, that cannot be penetrated by the masculine, exploring gaze. In a proper example of Irigaray's logic for Pound, the gaze is certainly masculine, and this masculine penetrating, seeking, and exploring gaze reacts to the colour, sensuality: \"Thus, if her colour \/ came against his gaze, \/ Tempered as if\/ It were through a perfect glaze\" (\"The Age Demanded,\" HSM 184). In this instance, however, the feminine gaze shows an ambiguity or ambivalence, which may result in a blurting of gender:     Then like brook-water, With a vacant gaze. The English Rubaiyat was still born In those days.     The thin, clear gaze, the same Still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd face. Questing and passive. . . \"Ah, poor Jenny's case\" . . (\"Yeux Glauques,\" HSM 176, Pound's Ellipses)     According to K. K. Ruthven, Jenny is probably an allusion to two women, the one in Rossetti's poem is a fired prostitute, \"Jenny,\" and the other is the famous pre-Raphaelite beauty, Jane Burden (Mrs. William Morris) who was known to the group as \"Janey\" (135). In particular, Hugh Witemeyer notes that \"the eyes of the Pre-Raphaelite muse symbolize both the strength and the limitation of Pre-Raphaelite vision\" (184) Witemeyer adds: \"But though this muse embodies the 'faun's flesh,' she lacks something of 'saint's vision.' Her gaze is 'clear,' but it is 'thin' and vacant', in Odyssean terms her gaze is 'questing' but 'passive ' Jenny\u2014confused, enervated, and exploited by her society\u2014becomes typical of the entire English tradition from which Mauberley descends\" (184). This English tradition can be seen as Pre-Raphaelite or Decadent movement of the Nineties, which might belong to the soft; yet, this softness is curiously paralleled with hardness such as passive\/questing and thin\/clear. In the above-cited lines, I think, Jenny is a signifier of the feminine vision of the Pre-Raphaelite, Jenny's gaze can comprise both the \"clear\" masculine Odyssean questing and the \"vacant\" feminine passive, while her gaze becomes a fetishized part object. This feminine gaze also seems to be made up of water, liquid, not light, and, thus, inevitably to signify the nothing\/excess of the fluids, because the fluids do not have motive force or form, however, this gaze is ambiguous, rather, heterogeneous, and can transgress and blur the binary of masculine\/feminine. Instead of penetration, therefore, the masculine transparent, lucid, and homogeneous, not hysteric, gaze is strangely juxtaposed to the vacant, opaque, and heterogeneous gaze[19] of feminine lack     Along with the masculine penetrating gaze, the gaze of the engraver is inscribing and engraving a phallic, self-same discourse into the feminine through the masculine form-creating force:     \"His true Penelope Was Flaubert,\" And his tool The engraver's. (HSM 182)     Mauberley's true Penelope, Flaubert, by his so-called realistic, scientific, and objectifying tools, inscribes his phallic pattern into his sentimental Bovary. Bovarism as Andreas Huyssen argues, although Flaubert says that Bovary is Flaubert himself (\"Madame Bovary, c'est moi\"), indeed, Bovary, Bovarism is not Flaubert, Madame Bovary, woman. is \"positioned as reader of inferior literature\u2014subjective, emotional, and passive\" while Flaubert, man, \"emerges as writer of genuine, authentic literature\u2014objective, ironic, and in control of his aesthetic means\" (46). Bovarism is, in fact, one of the representations of the objectification of a sentimental and feminized culture. Flaubert\/Mauberley is, here engraving phallic intervention into the feminized and sentimental culture by the masculine form-creating force, engraver's tool. Mauberley\/Flaubert, therefore, as in the form-creating force compelling the ovule into \"a given pattern\" in Pound's review of Gourmont's book, becomes the man who attempts to make the intaglio as well as the hollow by phallic assertions. In this respect, the direct quotation of Irigaray's remark would be illuminating for these details: \"By converting her to a discourse that denies the specificity of her pleasure by inscribing it as the hollow, the intaglio, the negative, even as the censured other of its phallic assertions. By hom(m)osexualizing her\" (S 140-1) In this case, her term, hom(m)osexuaIization, rather than the homosexual itself, means the male specular economy of the self-same from which woman is excluded, unmarked, and signifies nothing. This male economy of the self-same, hom(m)osexual, based on the narcissistic reflection, accordingly, just produces the same and auto-copies, the male economy of the hom(m)osexual is no more than a mimetic version of the male of \"Immaculate Conception\".     But there still remains the heterogeneous and disjunctive indeterminacy despite Mauberley's vain efforts to resuscitate the patriarchal, homogeneous, and self-same culture:     A conscious disjunct, Being but this overblotted Series Of intermittences; (HSM 186)     And this indeterminacy is located in Mauberley\/Pounds unconsciousness, which is heterogeneously, excessively presenting the epiphany of sexuality the body.     Body Is Fluid     That the body is inside the soul\u2014 the lifting and folding brightness the darkness shattered, the fragment. (113 788-9)[20]     Several critics have pointed out Pound's hierarchical sexual dualism, while his sexual dualism itself seems contradictory Suggesting modernist aesthetics as the persistent hierarchical sexual dualism; D. B. Jones defines \"that archetypal modernist.\" Pound's poetry and poetics as contaminated by an offensive sexist metaphysics (172) Indicating Pound's sexual politics as hierarchical, Michael Andr\u00e9 Bernstein says, in The Cantos, color, polysemy, and sexuality are \"seen as vital components of a full human realization\u2014but only as long as they are bounded and made serviceable by the shaping, linear, and phallic male order\" (358). Pointing out Pound's contradictory notions of the feminine, Barbara Will also notes that Pound persistently situates the feminine as a diminished or weaker version of the masculine, however, what is important in Will's argument is that Pound has appropriated \"the mysterious feminine essence' which metamorphoses the male poet into a resonant, transhistorical soundpiece (142).[21]     While some Pound critics point out Pound's hierarchical sexual dualism. Pounds appropriation of the fluidities has also been observed by several Pound scholars first, Ronald Bush points out, \"Pound took Upward's universe of fluid force[22] and made his own interpretation of the way man's swirl outward interpenetrates nature\" (Genesis 99) For Pound, the consciousness is \"germinal\" (SR 92). As the \"germinal\" is reminiscent of Gourmont's spermatozoid brain, in fact, Pound seems to appropriate the fluidities on account of his translation of Gourmont's book. Noting Pound's fluidities as coming from Gourmont, Leslie Heywood also observes, \"fluidity is for Pound a positive quality. . . . so in this sense the feminine is not necessarily negative\" (95) While, for Pound, the chaotic fluidities are not negative, the fluid is still giving primacy to the sperm fluid in his review of the translation of Gourmont's book.     More importantly, Kevin Oderman says. Pound\u2019s allusion to electricity and sexuality is described terms of fluidity (31); in his endnote, Oderman observes that in Pound's thought the \"radiant world\" and the world of \"fluid force\" seem to be synonymous (140 n. 10). Emphasizing the liquidity and fluidity of Pound in his poetic medium, Oderman reveals that Pound's radiant or light philosophy is coexistent with fluidity. In the Pisan Cantos, Oderman points out that the glaukopis \"which Upward is glossing is an adjective applied to the eyes of 'the goddess Athene,'\" and these eyes are the intermittent nature of Pound's vision because glaukopis \"that which gleams and then does not gleam\" (127-8). As Will notes, after all. Pound's female goddess, Athene, seems to be \"the very embodiment of a specifically feminine virtu.\" (142)     Noting Canto 29's lines, \"She is submarine, she is octopus, she is \/ A biological process,\" Will argues this process as osmosis. Will writes     It is the wave pattern cut in the stone which gives Pound hope in the etched clarity of its fluid lines it signifies an aesthetic, democratic union between binary differences: hard, eternal. towering, masculine stone joined with fluid, shifting, feminine writing For Pound to experience this epiphany, he must reveal his own feminine \"essence\" as the source of osmosis \"Sea weed dried now, and now floated, \/ mind drifts, weed, slow youth, drifts \u201cNel ventre tuo, o nella mente mia . . . \" At this moment, the speaker appropriates a female productivity as his own, womb becomes mind, and a multiplicity of voices form past generations \"fills\" the empty space of the text. (141. Will's ellipses)     The process of osmosis is that of gendering from the masculine to feminine. Pound's appropriation of the feminine \"essence\" gives him female productivity, in which Pound can have H.D.'s womb-mind, \"vision of the womb,\" not the spermatozoid brain, and the multiple, shifting, and fluid voices, not the masculine gaze. This female productivity functions as supplementary to the phallic, dead father's empty space of the text, for the feminine gives the mind and voice from the process of osmosis.     Pound's gender dynamics, as I have discussed, is recording the bordering area between the feminine and the masculine. While Pound persistently denigrates the feminine and pursues the phallic hardness, in his poetic writing, he apparently indicates his appropriation of the feminine fluidities. This ambivalence of Pound's gender issues will be discussed in the fourth chapter, \"The Economic of Metamorphic Fluidities.\"     [17] I'm now using the term \"phallic\" with \"omnipotent preoedipal.\" Rather, the preoedipal means the semiotic or the imaginary, not the phallic. In this case, I think, as Gallop argues, my use of the term \"phallic\" may indicate that \"to speak of a phallic mother' is to subsume female experience into male categories\" (117). Though Gallop's tone is quite critical, it is true that the Phallus seems to signifying an authority \\'et, while a feminist argues the \"phallic mother\" as a fraud, this phallic mother's supposed omniscience and omnipotence may compare to the preoedipal mother' power over life and death (Gallop 117). [18] Defining the gaze as the masculine, Ofelia Schutte points out that, by the masculine gaze, Irigaray presents the status of fefishized femininity (66). [19] According to Peter Brooker, in \"Yeux Glauques,\" the subtitle of this poem, the French word, \"Glauque\" means \"glaucous,\" dull bluish-green or grey in English (201) I think, this color of dull bluish-green or grey is signifying the feminine, disruptive, opaque gaze as opposed to the masculine penetrating, transparent, lucid one. Referring to Upward's study, Pound says, \"Glaux, owl, totem or symbolic bird (gods connected with the divine animals, as stupid bitch Hera has bull eyes), glare-eyed, owl-eyed Athena\" (cited in Berryman 115). For Berryman, \"Yeux Glauques\" refers to the duality, \"the characteristic of glittering\u2014of alternating\u2014of being one thing and then another\" \"It is this quality of changeability, or duality, that is significant for Pound\u2014that characterizes his goddess\" (115). Berryman writes: \"When Mauberley refers to 'Yeux Glauques,' he alludes to the clich\u00e9, to the decorative and ornamental style associated with the Pre- Raphaelite and the nineties in France. But for Pound, the term can suggest the quality of immediate and sudden change\u2014the characteristic that links it with the goddess who, like a Circe, the Cyprian, 'Jenny,' or Athene, can instantly metamorphose from one form to another. From goddess of love to whore, from divine to damned, goddesses with 'Yeux Glauques' share an ambivalent nature \"(116). [20] Oderman notes that, in terms of Plotinus, Pound \"describes this luminous envelope which he sees surrounding the body\" (119). [21] Will argues that Pound appropriates the feminine essence, but she is questioning of what is the relation between various women in Pound's text. For example, there are Pernella and Cunizza in Canto 29 who represent the bad and the good women respectively (141-2). [22] For Pound, the universe is fluid: \"We have about us the universe of fluid force, and below us the germinal universe of wood alive, of stone alive Man is\u2014the sensitive physical part of him\u2014a mechanism, for the purpose of our further discussion a mechanism rather like an electric appliance, switches, wires, etc. As to his consciousness, the consciousness of some seems to rest, or to have its center more properly, in what the Greek psychologists called phantastikon. Their minds are, that is, circumvolved about them like soap bubbles reflecting sundry patches of the macrocosmos. And with certain others their consciousness is 'germinal.' Their thoughts are in them as the thought of the tree is in the seed, or in the grass, or the grain, or the blossom. And these minds are the more poetic, and they affect mind about them, and transmute it as the seed the earth. And this latter sort of mind is close on the vital universe; and the strength of the Greek beauty rests in this, that it is ever at the interpretation of this vital universe, by its signs of gods and godly attendants and oreads\" (SR 92-3).     - Bacigalupo, Massimo.

Intro question: What is the social innovation Nefiks about? Nefiks is about young people obtaining skills away from school or university Nefiks works with young people aged 14 to 29, which is also the defined age range of young people in Slovenia. Nefiks helps you to record all the skills you gain from extra curricular activities, from non-formal education, and from voluntary work. Basically, you can get these skills anywhere apart from school. All these skills help you with your personal growth, with job-hunting, and with your CV.     Why did you (or your partners) start this social innovation? The idea came to me during my NGO work. It was developed in the 90\u2019s and it comes out of youth work. Youth work is a big field of activities, volunteering, advising young people, and providing workshops. It takes up a lot of time of the people involved, but they didn\u2019t have any tools to bring all those experiences to future employers to prove that they knew how to lead a team, work in a team, organize activities, and that they also knew how to do expert work and so on. My colleagues went to Finland and they saw that there was a small book that people could write in and then confirm with a stamp and sign that somebody had done something. So they brought the idea here and made a book. It started with the activities of youth work. It was designed in a way so that young people could acquire competences all non-educational fields. It was designed for youth work but has been developed in a way that means anyone can write something in it.     How did you come up with the idea? Was a creative or collaborative process involved? I think it was the need which brought this. It was a question of how we could show to the employer that we knew something and that we could also demonstrate the knowledge and skills. It was a collaborative process of two people at first, which then led to the formation of an organization.     What were you afraid of in the beginning and how (if at all) did you overcome your fear? I don\u2019t think there was any fear present in the beginning, because they had nothing to lose in bringing that out and they also had good support from The Office of the Republic of Slovenia for Youth. This is an independent body within the Ministry of Education. With the development Nefiks had a lot of other tools which did the same but didn\u2019t exist for very long. The biggest fear was that the Ministry was giving out money for all these tools but none of them were as resistant or had a long history or as many functions as Nefiks.     What were the beginnings of the social innovation? (i.e. how did you build your initiative, business, NGO from scratch). Nefiks grew in another youth organization called Mladinski ceh, which also had a lot of other projects. One of those was Nefiks but at one point this project become too big for one NGO. It took up too many resources, too much finance, and too many people. At that point, it became a spin-off and became the independent institution, NGO Nefiks. Our main aim today is to organize all the activities that allow young people to meet employers.     How did you attract public attention to the issue you wanted to tackle and make others believe in your purpose and potential? That is still a work in process. No matter how long Nefiks exists, we are still fighting for attention. When young people search for a job and suddenly connect with Nefiks, they are very happy because they can make a record of all their past experiences. A very strong point is when young people really need Nefiks. No matter what we are also trying to promote, with Nefiks already in high schools and universities they usually write to Nefiks when they are looking for jobs. And we also never get financing for the tool itself but for the projects around the tools. Young people believe in an idea when they need it. (NB \u2013 consider re-writing this section, it doesn\u2019t really make sense)     How did you make sure that your idea actually fits the needs of the users? It is a process because it came out of a need but then the reality changed. We adjust the system all the time and in the meantime it has also become an electronic system. We don\u2019t only do this, but we also adjust the idea to the needs of young people and also link it to the employment market. It is an on-going process. Also, young people who are in a situation, who need Nefiks, work closely with us. In our organization young people also have power.     How did you raise the money for your idea and what is your advice for others considering DIY fundraising? The inventors of Nefiks, Dru\u0161tvo Mladinski Ceh, got support from the Office of the Republic of Slovenia for Youth. Later on, the Ministry of Education remained a supporter but not with big financial assistance. We had to search for projects all the time to support at least one part of Nefiks. We also have dedicated IT people who started the tools and they are trying to maintain these with us and provide insights. Recently, we got an EU project, financed from European Structure Funds (ESF) and we developed the Nefiks tools system for acquiring competencies towards the platform for meeting young people and employers. We struggle all the time.     How did you scale your social innovation and what tips for scaling could you share? It was a very intuitive process. It was never a very planned process. This was the background for our NGO. Nefiks is not the only thing we do. We build strong activities around Nefiks (employment club, career club, the \u2018Kolegice\u2019 project for young women). Nefiks grows with these activities. We also have a group of Nefiks tutors. These are young people who promote Nefiks and they give us feedback on how to make it even better for young people. This is a very spontaneous process that would be difficult to scale.     How do you change the whole system? The idea is that they have to collect skills and knowledge in one portfolio. But young people only realize this when they are searching for a job and I guess with Nefiks they at least get to know this. Our influence is limited to the network. Also, the youth organization starts to write down the content they can develop within their framework when they are working with them. Our greatest achievement was when Nefiks was presented at the EU Summit in Belgium in 2014. The international community gave Nefiks credit for being a good tool and a good system.     What it the one piece of advice you can give to an aspiring social innovator, a member of the Social Innovation Academy? You have to believe in what you are doing. Our experience shows that you cannot enrich it. You have to believe in it because of its costs. We believe in Nefiks because we see that many people have better positions in the job market. Many who use our system are also more self-confident. Many young people are even happier because of it. If we didn\u2019t believe in Nefiks, the project would not survive because it works with very low financial support. We also need to have other activities to financially and logistically support social innovation.     Interviewed by Maja Novak *** Alenka Blazin\u0161ek Domenis is the manager of Nefiks. She believes in sincere enthusiasm and in people. Through many different ways of voluntary work (learning assistance, leisure activities with children and young people, organizing projects, working with the elderly, helping disabled people, conducting events) and in the mentoring of volunteers in the field of non-formal education, she learned respect for diversity, working with people, gaining pedagogical qualities and motivation for spreading awareness of the importance of volunteering.

      "text":" Moje poro\u010dilo z What\u2019s Best Foruma o zanimivi izku\u0161nji z zunanjimi kretnicami...     I first heard AlsyVox Botticelli speakers in Munich Hi-Fi Deluxe in 2017 and since I was on a hunt for new speakers, became extremely intrigued since they sounded surprisingly full-bodied, transparent and refined, and they produced bass I have never heard from any planar speakers. Demos on following Munich shows were unfortunately less successful but I made my homework and decided to buy them. I\u2019ll not describe how Botticellis sound to me since my experience has been basically the same as other owners already reported and no need to repeat what was already written or invent new adjectives. So, I would just like to describe in a few words how my Botticellis sound with external crossovers.     If you buy AlsyVox Botticelli speakers with external crossovers, the package is called Botticelli X but they can also be bought separately as an upgrade to the standard Botticelli. External crossovers come in a high quality, huge and very heavy case, weighting 50kg\/110lbs. Speakers are finished in black plexiglass, but external crossovers are made completely from that material (aluminum is optional) and are resting on a separate isolation platforms, made from transparent plexiglass. Inside you would find only high quality Mundorf capacitors and resistors, Jantzen inductors and there\u2019s also an option to fine tune the mid and high frequencies (+-0.6dB). The topology of the crossover is patent pending by Omega Audio Concepts, also umbilical connections between speaker and crossover are made with Omega AC Nano extra cables. You can choose black color if you wish...     Connection between internal and external crossovers is simple but you need to by-pass the internal crossovers first (a quick and simple procedure), and then you just connect three cables to appropriate inputs of speakers and outputs of crossovers, and connect them to power amps. Unfortunately my experience with this beautiful pieces of equipment lasted only a few hours but still enough to get a feeling how good they are. Even though I expected they would sound better than build-in crossovers, they did surprise me since I never imagined the improvement could be so huge. Obviously the design is crucial and, as I wrote above, is patent pending.     The most obvious improvement was in soundstage width and depth. Soundstage wasn\u2019t small to begin with but it literally exploded the moment music started to roll. The sensation was like opening big doors or windows to the event. Everything became more clear and in more realistic proportions. System was breathing even more freely and sounded more unobtrusively open (and these speakers already sound very open and clean). Room walls disappeared much more convincingly, there was more distinction among the instruments and images were also more stable. Next thing were lower registers. Bass was \u201cturbo charged\u201d - much more powerful, had greater impact and control. It was like speakers were driven by a high power solid state amps. Since this is very important to me, I was also paying attention to colors of instruments, their timbre and density, and this was also improved. Not as much as bass or soundstage but tonal density was on a higher level too.     I would write more if I could listen longer, but this short audition was enough to get an idea of what these crossovers basically bring to the table. For me, they represent important sonic upgrade to beautifully made, finished and sounding Botticelli speakers. Also they offer a bit of welcome and simple fine tuning via connection possibilities and look as gorgeous as speakers themselves. Perfect combination. Yes, they\u2019re expensive but judging from this audition, easily worth their money.     Pripenjam \u0161e eno poro\u010dilo uporabnika Botticelli X:     \u201cI have been searching for a suitable replacement for our Focal Utopia EVO loudspeakers for quite a while as they were starting to become a limiting factor in our product development. They have served their purpose very well but we have reached a point where the audibility of certain aspects of music reproduction exceed their \"pay grade\". This was becoming obvious during our visits to Matej, Steve, Mike, Rob, Bob, Jeroen and \"the French\", all very different systems with different presentations, but all laying bare shortcomings in our own in house system.     I am a big ribbon fan. I have owned the original Apogee Full Range which I finally sold due to driving headaches. From memory the tweeter was around 0.8 ohms and the midrange 0.2 ohms, combined with a very low sensitivity which was estimated in the 80-84dB range and a maximum excursion of 3mm on the bass ribbon before it started to seriously buzz. It was really hard to get these to sing. I had custom better transformers made for the midrange, for the tweeter you could get away with something like a 2.2 ohm series resistor. For good results you really needed an active crossover and 6(mono) power amplifiers. But they were capable of a mind blowing sound.     Enter Alsyvox, an easy 4 ohm load, first order crossovers, 18mm-20mm excursion capability, a 94-95dB sensitivity and a full 20Hz-40Khz frequency response. We heard the Tintoretto at Bob (Rhapsody.Audio NY), zero driver integration issues, moves serious air, you will not lust for a subwoofer with these, an incredible transparency from the lowest to the highest registers, full soundstage envelopment and very fast and dynamic with real punch and impact. These are really everything an Apogee owner would have wanted them to be capable of, and I'm sure had Apogee not gone bust this is how they would look today.     I went back and forth with Bob on the options available to us and decided to contact Daniele Coen. Daniele turned out to be a very nice guy, passionate about what he does, completely understood what I was after, what was important to me and 2 weeks later a pair of Alsyvox Botticellis showed up. These honestly exceeded my (high) expectations cold out of the box, we had them playing about an hour after delivery and our whole crew did nothing else then listen to music for the remainder of the day, all of us even ended up calling home with the excuse we had to put in some overtime that day! Incredibly musical, impressive sound and just plain fun to listen to.     Being aware there was an \"X\" upgrade available to the Botticelli which consists of external crossovers with a patent pending crossover topology I was curious how much that could possibly improve the already incredible Botticellis, so I called Daniele and he offered to come over to visit us and personally install them.     One of the guys took some photos of Daniele's visit which have been posted online by Mono&Stereo. I will include the higher resolution versions here:\u201d     In \u0161e eno... \u201cI am excitedly writing this post as a Maggie fan from more than 20 years ago, a hobbyist who organised a group buy for Hovland caps from Alex Crespi and Alphacore copper foil inductors to build 17 sets of external crossovers DIY kits for other Maggie 1.6's owner's.     There was gorgeous tonality for female vocals but the big negatives were the large size of the singers mouths and lack of bass. I then moved on to stand mount monitors for the pin point imaging they could deliver, and tried my best to integrate them with a subwoofer.     Now the Botticelli X's have taken center stage on my audiophile journey. They exhibit such a well defined soundstage, that I had come up with a new term in my audio vocabulary \"Spatial Resolution\". The standard description of depth and layering does not adequately describe the sonic landscape of instruments and singers which is painted by the Botticelli X.     Whenever I audition a new piece of gear, the first track I always play is Miles Davis Time after Time, the live version. A somewhat challenged recording with sound system hum at the venue and other problems. As I listened to Miles playing, the beautiful tonality of his trumpet made me search for words to describe the experience. What came to mind was \"harmonic canvass\" and how the system presented richness, texture and above all sheer beauty of Miles' trumpet performance. The decays had a clarity and naturalness that had me ooing and arrghing.     I have always suspected from the soundstage spatial cues that the venue space was pretty large. The spatial resolution of the Botticellis convinced me more than ever that the venue was very large. A quick Google search listed the concert venue as a 2,500 seat cinema \/ theatre in Milan, confirming the spatial resolution was indeed delivering an accurate depiction of hall size     Then came Eva Cassidy's Fields of Gold vocal check. The texture of the voice, the harmonic tones of the guitar breathtakingly beautiful. The thought that I could not get out of my mind, was \"Beam me up Scotty\", I have been teleported through time and space and inserted into the recording venue, up front and center.     Glen Gould, Goldberg Variations, BWV 988 - a great performance but a so so, somewhat muffled recording. Good tube amps driving horn speakers can really bring this recording to life. In my experience very good solid state amps driving conventional speakers often struggle to deliver the attack needed to make the performance exciting. Here the Botticelli's were delivering attack at a level competitive with good horn systems I have heard.     The tonality of Glen Gould's piano reminded me of a day about 30 years ago when a Steinway trained piano tuner came to my previous home in New York to tune a very consumer \/ hobby grade baby grand piano. After tuner was done, the piano sounded like a Steinway for the next six months. The Botticelli to my ear is able to carry out a similar harmonic enhancement and sonic alchemy.     Large orchestral pieces are truly an experience to behold. The separation of the instruments, you think that you are hearing and seeing the movement of the bows over the strings. No instrument is attached to the speakers, the level of distortion is that low. Each section of the orchestra is communicating its distinct musical motif with emotion, drive and clarity to their fellow players, PRAT in spades !     For bass drum depiction, my go to track is Jamie Cullum's \"If I rule the World\" When I heard the tightness and texture, I called out to the others in the room, \"Absolutely no subwoofer needed\"     For any audiophile interested in planars, the Botticelli X is a must audition     My personal thanks to Daniele for creating a planar that is so musically satisfying that it has propelled my listening enjoyment to levels beyond my expectations.\u201d     Originalni prispevek je na isti strani kot prej\u0161nji.     Continuing Edward's report, I would like to share my feelings about the Botticellis too after an extensive 2-day-audition in Hengelo:     I gladly followed Emiles invitation to hear his newest toys along with Edward. This has been my second visit to Taiko and boy did his system evolve from the former SGM2015\/T+A\/VTL\/KEF Blade combo I heard roughly 3 years ago. My first encounter with these marvels was at Hifi Deluxe last year, where I certainly liked them but didn't fall in love with them - that has changed now.     The Botticellis are the most transparent, resolving and revealing speakers I have encountered so far. We started with some HD Tape Transfer recordings I brought along which I know quite well from home - but what I heard was so far ahead that at first I couldn't believe my ears. The texture of the saxes on a Mulligan\/Desmond recording was breathtaking, the intensity of the choir of a Carmina Burana recording was spooky. These HDTT recordings mostly sound fantastic, although at home my attention is sometimes focused on the tape noise\/hiss. In Emile's system the noise is of course also displayed, but it does not distract from the music in any way. Quite the contrary, it gave the recordings a vintage atmosphere that was kind of beneficial instead of distracting. The system was able to reproduce depth in a way I thought was not possible, on Antiphone Blues I was seeing the organ 30 meters behind the sax player and the space of the venue was clearly laid bare - proof that no sub is needed with these as Edward pointed out. The individual voices of the choir on Joni Mitchel's Sire of Sorrow (live) were clearly audible with a reach out and touch effect to them. The proof that a system is an over achiever for me is always classical. I do not listen to classical music very often, I can appreciate it though when reproduced well. I can count the occasions on one hand where classical music was played and I actually felt the urge to play more. Those occasions were a full MBL reference system, a full Ypsilon system, a Devore O\/Reference and the LV Vox Olympian. The Botticellis with the Audionet combo is now leading that pack and gets my very seldom given classical approved stamp.     I was amazed when we did a comparison of hard drive vs Tidal vs Quobuz on the Extreme. The Botticellis (and of course the downstream components of Extreme, TD12 and Audionet) were able to show the differences clearly, although as the evening moved on, the differences became notable smaller and smaller - an interesting observation. As the second day came to an end though we were so in the zone, that we didn't care what the source material was and just enjoyed everything big time - that for me is the real essence what a great system should be able to deliver.     Are the Botticellis for everyone? No, they do have a certain aesthetic which conventional cones do not have which may be not for everybody. They do not have the concentrated and focused energy of horns, but they are close. Nor do they have the super-pinpoint and razor sharp imaging of a small 2-way, but they come very close (In fact I was especially surprised at the rendering of height differences of sound events relative to each other, something I didn't expect). What they do though is complete transparency and control at any volume. They can show very high color intensity when it is on the recording, they completely disappear and have this special boxless sound to them that makes you think of a window being opened completely.     In summary, Emiles system is one of the top 3 I have heard so far and in certain areas the best. My hats off to Daniele for building an incredible speaker, every owner can be sure to have an absolute worldclass transducer at home.     Poro\u010dilo z Norve\u0161ke... \u201cAlsyVox BOTTICELLI - a brief and hectic meeting at PM Audio Featured Written by Karl Erik Sylthe     AlsyVox is a new and exciting addition to the Scandinavian speaker flora. And it was this loudspeaker that urged me taking a break from family and zoo this summer day towards the end of the holiday.     I received a very warm welcome from Paul Mortensen this day in july towards the end of the holiday. Fiery, one might say, because the temperature moved up into spheres where it has no habit of traveling in our latitudes, although this is in the South - a foreign territory to me.     PM Audio is located in Nodeland, approx. 10 minutes drive west of Kristiansand, in premises that are really a somewhat large detached house where HiFi business, listening room, cable workshop and housing are integrated in an unusual way. I know of men who would be thrown out of home because of far less gear than what we find here. But on the other hand, it is not so easy to determin who should throw out who at Mortensen's. Because PM Audio is a family business where both Marion and Paul are involved in the operation of the company. In fact, I did not find many traces of Prestbakken 26 being a residence. But this must be a very practical solution when working almost 24 hours a day, and most people lack their sharp distinction between work and leisure. There is reason to assume that Marion and Paul live for PM Audio most part of the day.     Then we finally got to the main attraction. These speakers we reported earlier this summer , and for which Paul got the agency hijacked after this year's HigEnd in Munich. He has cast a lustful look at these speakers from a distance for a few years, but the opportunity to listen to them has not flipped until now this year.     Alsyvox is located in Valencia, the Spanish city that is otherwise filled to the brim with spectacular architecture by Santiago Calatrava. But since designer and designer is Italian Daniele Coen, these speakers are referred to as Spanish-Italian, and all have model names with unmistakable Italian sound.     AlsyVox has four different models - Tintoretto, Botticelli, Caravaggio and Michelangelo. Paul has initially chosed to bring in the second smallest model Botticelli, but without \"second least\" is the most descriptive characteristic I can imagine. These 115 kg heavy flakes has a height of 1770 mm and is 640 mm wide.     The structure of the AlsyVox speakers are 3-way magnetostatic dipoles. At the top they reach up to 40kHz, while Botticelli goes flat Down to 22 Hz! The larger models go even lower, respectively. 18 and 20 Hz, still flat, with most manufacturers indicating frequency response that includes a roll-off of -3dB, or even -6 dB.     The layout Magical sound never arise in a vacuum. Therefore, it is important to present the rest of the layout that contributed to the exquisite result. Paul has been helpful, sending me an outline of the set we played on this merry Christmas day:     CD player: KALISTA - DreamPlay One (with external power supply \/ 1Farad) Mounted on a searate vibration damper in the same design as the player itself Turntable: Scheu - DAS LAUFWERK Tonearm: Shy - TACCO 12 \u00bb Pickup: Gold Note \u2013 TUSCANY GOLD RIAA: Sutherland - PHONOBLOCK REFINED - 2 monoblocks Preamplifier: CODA - 07X Power Amplifier: CODA No.8 Speakers: AlsyVox - BOTTICELLI Signal Cables: Black Magic Cables \u2013 REVELATION IC MKIII Speaker Cables: Black Magic Cables - EMOTION Current Cables: Furutech - NANOFLUX NCF Current suppliers: Furutech - Pure Power 6 NCF + TP-809E NCF Power filter: Furutech - FLUX 50 NCF Vibration \/ resonance control: PM ISOLATION and Black Magic Cones Special products for canceling static electricity and mechanical damping of connectors and cables: Furutech - NCF Booster \/ NCF Booster Signal AlsyVox BOTTICELLI plays music It started with the KKV classic Desemberbarn , where Kari Bremnes sings with Rikard Wolff, who passed away a couple of years ago. On the opening track, Wolff sings alone, and there is a rather magical presence in his vocals accompanied by a piano, and eventually also the violin. The soundscape is huge and the sound is crystal clear. The bass is cellar deep, effortless and with great authority.     The next disc on the CD player was Sheffield Labs' Matter of Time , with Michael Allen Harrison & Friends. I can't remember the last time I heard such a compelling and natural rendering of a piano, without the piano itself being present in the room.     More from Sheffield Labs - The Moscow Sessions Complete is a triple CD with works by various composers. Paul started with CD 2, and I took the opportunity for a small quiz. I met pretty precisely on dating and nation, but have to admit a little shamefully that I didn't take Shostakovich. To my defense, he had not yet developed much of his character yet at Symphony No.1. But anyway - the sound reproduction was magical. Very few are able to present such good resolution and precision of the instruments in a symphony orchestra. And again, this deep, authoritarian bass impresses, even though it is only fairly secluded in the soundscape. That's when good bass really shows up, not on megabass releases. And there was also a pretty formidable dynamic on this recording, a dynamic that really got to romp on BOTTICELLI.     A small visit of Tschaikovski on CD 1 showed that the magical sound reproduction was not a coincidence, related to Dmitri's first symphony.     Finally, Paul also had to play some vinyl. The film music from Dances with Wolves is film music with American accent signed John Barry, almost a bit Copland. Here exquisitely reproduced with great dynamics and fantastic resolution. And I am reminded of how lucrative it is to listen to this type of music when the facility is unable to convey the whole while preserving all the details, but collapses in the experiment. At BOTTICELLI it sounds fantastic.     We lift our eyes Here is the order of the wiring ...BOTTICELLI held a very compelling and impressive concert for a short hour at PM Audio. Paul himself thinks that he has now reached the finish in his quest for the optimal sound, although he is not quite done with the process of placing the speakers in the room. One of the factors he wants to work more on is acoustically disconnecting the speakers from the floor as much as possible. And when that process is finished, he is fiddling with the idea of \u200b\u200barranging some sort of mini-mass at PM Audio.\u201d     Alsyvox, Omega Audio Concepts | RMAF 2019 Posted on September 11, 2019 by Eric Franklin Shook\u2122 in RMAF 2019     DENVER (PTA) \u2014 I love big panel speakers. They play the room unlike any other loudspeakers I know of. However, the most common (and annoying) myth about them is that panel speakers have trouble producing real bass without a ton of power. Alsyvox and Omega Audio Concepts joined forces at the Rocky Mountain International Audio Fest 2019 to shake-up these misconceptions.     The Story:     In recent years Alsyvox has had many great showings around the audio show circuit. Most of these were personally missed due to the fact that I like to choose what rooms I cover at shows after all others on our writing team have expressed their own interests. Subsequently, the low draft status of my own choosing puts me at the disadvantage, as Alsyvox was never available for me to experience and write about until now. Luckily for me, this go round Alsyvox\u2019s new Botticelli X panels being held in a larger room than I\u2019ve previously seen.     I say I\u2019m lucky about the Alsyvox Botticelli X ($87,000 pr USD) being in a larger room as in previous instances I felt the previous model Botticelli (standard version) were a bit much for the smaller spaces I\u2019d previously heard them in. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they sounded lifelike and thrilling, but a little throttled by the room size. The Botticelli and Botticelli X are by company terms considered to be the \u201cmiddle\u201d sized offering in the Alsyvox product line-up. However, I do not consider them small or even mid-sized in the least, especially when it comes to how they play.     The Botticelli X is a full-range true three-way ribbon design, with distinctly higher crossover points than conventional loudspeakers (750Hz, 6000kHz), and in this new upgraded range, the ability to opt for dual-outboard crossovers which bypass the stock internal ones. Also of note about the Botticelli platform is that these are high sensitivity speakers at 94db. Making amplifier options more diverse than other panel speakers on the market.     It is possible to upgrade existing Botticelli loudspeakers to Botticelli X status by purchasing the two external passive crossovers. Each crossover is made out of CNC machined aluminum billets and uses an exclusive patent pending topology designed by Omega Audio Concepts. The crossover umbilical connection between the speaker and external crossover is made using Omega Audio Concepts\u2019s AC NANO Extra cabling.     Powering the whole affair, were a table full of Omega Audio Concepts DNA mono amplifiers, DNA CD Player, DNA Digital-to-Analog Converter, and NANO Extra silver plated copper cables.     In a static display were a few samples of the Omega\u2019s The Element(s) series of cables, and literature. I can\u2019t be certain if any of the cables in the system were from The Element(s) series as it was quite busy behind the equipment as you can see by the photos.     The Sound:     Essentially the Alsyvox Botticelli as just a single panel speaker. But how it plays the room so authoritatively. You\u2019d be convinced that there were dynamic-driver sub-woofers somewhere in the building. This is one of the largest exhibit rooms in the Gaylord Rockies Hotel, and it seems like the Botticelli and Omega Audio Concepts components and cables were seeing little in any sense of struggle. The traditional three-way crossover points found on most traditional speakers are moved upwards with the Botticelli panels. I am urged to credit these crossover points for the more full-range slam of the Botticelli X speakers, but I can\u2019t be sure. Being a generous stack of Omega Audio Concepts electronics at play, the power and silent background delivery of this pairing were top of the class. "

      "text":" Alumni event: \u201cLook into the unknown, into the chaos.\u201d     \u201cGet to know yourself, get to know the leader inside you\u201d was the recurring theme of the alumni event held on 18 October 2018 at the Faculty of Economics at the University of Ljubljana. The discussion revolved around the tremendous impact of a profound personal change on a person\u2019s business and interpersonal relations. Experienced experts who work in this area in one way or another delved into the aspect of a conscious leader of the current times, whereas the guest Du\u0161ica Kunaver, a collector of traditional folk materials, recounted an antique story about leadership and intellect.     Dr. Matja\u017e Luna\u010dek, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, first touched upon the issue of identity crisis and, consequently, the trigger that forces a person to find an overall purpose and meaning. Endless competitiveness (and its growing importance in society) can undermine a person\u2019s self-image already in adolescence when they fail to achieve something. It is not only self-image that is affected, but interpersonal relations, too. We thus have fanatic parents on one side and children, overburdened by knowledge, on the other, and there is insufficient communication among them, which usually leads to a number of psychosomatic disorders.     \u201cWe must be aware that we are essentially not only intellectual beings, but also emotional and spiritual\u201d, emphasised Barbara Sari\u0107, BSc in Psychotherapy and trainee specialist in psychoanalysis, adding that the path towards oneself is the most important and inevitable way for those wishing to discover what makes them happy and become aware of how to overcome fear. We can only overcome fear if we focus on ourselves, if we know what we want and are aware that we can always rely on our inner strength.     Sandi Dolinar, a well-established meditation instructor, stressed the importance of intuition and inner emotions which help us grow personally and spiritually. \u201cChildren adopt and accept patterns from their parents. If parents give love to their children, that is the most they can give\u201d, he said. If we want to give something, we can only give it, if we have it. This means that one must become love, accept and love oneself as well as work on oneself, while also being aware of the fact that if one wishes a change, one must change oneself first because it is impossible to change other people, at least not completely.     \u201cWe must look into the unknown, into the chaos\u201d, said Ksenija \u0160piler Bo\u017ei\u010d, Director and Business Coach at the BB Svetovanje consulting company. She explained chaos is something we are unfamiliar with, something that is not evident enough. Therefore, chaos should be accepted and, in the midst of chaos, decisions made and paths that make us happy chosen. But before we can do that, we must first be in contact with ourselves and listen to our internal feeling. That is precisely why it is important to never stop researching, as no solution is an \u2018instant\u2019 answer.     Marja \u010cerneli\u010d, MSc, personal advisor and author of the book \u2018Second Birth\u2019, spoke about family determination that can influence our dark side and become an obstacle in life. If you are very meticulous, you look for reasons for everything. But if you want to reach deeper into your findings, your essence and truth, you must research as only this way will you find your sparkle, your true self. It is important you find your own essence, on top of all knowledge.     The experienced experts also discussed leadership and agreed that interconnecting, interaction and mutual influence are all extremely important. Moreover, one should be aware of authority and respectfulness. A good leader must live according to their mission, search for solutions and not for mistakes and, most importantly, must act inclusively because they influence other people by setting an example and acting as a role model.     The event was enriched by an art exhibition by Jan Bernot and Prof. Dr Deja Muck who has developed personally through fine arts. She presented her work entitled \u2018Path of Love \u2013 Path towards Oneself\u2019 where she employed the fractal drawing method to achieve freedom of the heart.

      "text":" Weather and climate     The weather is an important part of the natural environment. It directly or indirectly affects many of our activities. We tend to be acutely aware of the weather when we are faced with exceptional or dangerous phenomena that could endanger our property, safety or even lives. Such phenomena are, for example, gale-force winds, hail, heavy rainfall, sleet, ice and frost.     On these pages you will find warnings about dangerous weather events so that you will not be surprised by them, and you will be able to take appropriate action. The weather is, of course, also important for us when it remains within the limits of normal conditions. That is why we provide you with an up-to-date weather forecast for the current day and the next day, as well as with predictions for the following days. Since the weather knows no national boundaries, we also provide forecasts for neighbouring regions.     If you are interested in current weather conditions, you can view data from our meteorological stations and stations across Europe. We also enable you to view weather conditions across Europe as seen by a meteorological satellite from a height of 36,000 km above the equator. All those wondering whether to take an umbrella or not will find it interesting to look at a radar image of precipitation taken by our meteorological radar on Mount Lisca.     On these pages you will also find special weather forecasts, forecasts for pilots, mountain area forecasts, coastal forecasts, warnings about fire risk in the natural environment, and the latest snow conditions in the mountain area. Here you will find the forecast of the impact of weather on human health and behaviour, as well as UV index forecasts during the summer months so that you can properly protect yourselves against harmful sun rays. Together with the Institute of Public Health, we provide information on the concentration of allergenic pollen in the air.     Amateurs and others who would like to know more about the weather can access the results of calculations of our prognostic model, which provides a more detailed picture of future weather developments across Slovenia.     On our pages, in addition to the forecasts and data mentioned, you will also find some of our major projects, national as well as international, and various interesting facts, answers and frequently asked questions about the weather.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:     Improvement of the environmental footprint and resource efficiency of freshwater aquaculture and stimulation of its diversification and growth in the framework of an integrated freshwater bioeconomy strategy. Preservation of freshwater biodiversity by reducing the freshwater aquaculture impacts (e.g. with appropriate spatial planning) and assessment of its potential for biotechnological applications Stimulation of sustainable economic growth and jobs creation in the freshwater bioeconomy sector for people living in lakeside and riverside areas in Europe. Improvement of the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy. Scope: Freshwater systems host an immense biodiversity and support a multitude of activities providing livelihoods to inland populations. Lakes, ponds and rivers require a transition to more sustainable and environment-friendly productive ecosystems through optimal water management and planning, mutually benefiting the different ecosystem services by developing economic activities in rural areas, maintaining the biodiversity, and increasing resilience to climate change and water crises.     Aquaculture, in particular integrated multi-trophic or recirculating aquaculture systems, can be key for the development of lakeside and riverside areas as it can be combined with other bio-based activities, such as farming, livestock and the use of hitherto unused naturally produced biomass. Addressing environmental concerns, such as the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive, are essential for sustainable growth of freshwater aquaculture. Preserving biodiversity, including health and biosecurity issues, is also key for potential biotechnological applications that should also be explored under this topic.     The Strategic Working Group on Fisheries and Aquaculture (SCAR-Fish) of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) highlighted in a recent study[1] several issues that urgently need to be explored by research and addressed by innovation, such as climate change-related issues and issues of profitability. Research in this topic should consider the priorities of the SCAR-Fish study.     Strong and active involvement of stakeholders and end-users, including industry and NGOs, in a co-creation approach, is key for the success of the projects that will be selected.     International co-operation with partners from non-associated third countries is strongly encouraged as a win-win scenario, while contributing to the European competitiveness and resilience.     Where relevant, proposals may seek synergies and capitalise on the results of projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, its continuation European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and other funding streams     Specific Topic Conditions: Activities are expected to achieve TRL 3-6 by the end of the project \u2013 see General Annex B.

The two presidents began the second day of the official visit in Kranj. They visited Gimnazija France Pre\u0161eren Kranj, where they met with students and talked to them about the European future. This is how the two presidents take part in the Conference on the Future of Europe. Presidents Pahor and de Sousa discussed the role of the European Union in our common future with upper secondary students from Kranj. A particular focus was on sustainable development and the climate future. The topics included the opportunities offered by the European Union to young people and the role of the EU in the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end, the presidents and students talked about the possibilities of EU enlargement and exchanged views on Brexit.

They unveiled a bench of friendship between Slovenia and Portugal in front of the France Pre\u0161eren Monument in the town centre. The location was chosen with good reason as Pre\u0161eren, when writing the Sonnets of Misfortune, was inspired by the great Portuguese poet Camoes, to whom he also paid homage in his Gloss. As part of his official visit, President de Sousa met in the morning with students of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana who attend the Portuguese language course. On this occasion, the University of Ljubljana confirmed the introduction of the study programme \"Portuguese Language and Literature\", which is to start in the next academic year. According to President de Sousa, this will further strengthen the bonds between the Slovenian and Portuguese cultures. The official visit ended with a lunch hosted by President of the Portuguese Republic de Sousa in honor of President of the Republic of Slovenia Pahor.

      "text":" Pierre Mechain was born on August 16, 1744 in Laon. He was son of an architect, and originally wanted to follow his father in a career in architecture. He studied math and physics, but due to financial difficulties left college. For some time, he worked as a tutor. Then he became friend of Jerome de Lalande, who let him proof-read parts of his book \"L'Astronomie\". In 1772, Lalande obtained a position for Mechain as assistant hydrographer at the Depot of Maps and Charts of the Navy in Versailles. In the beginning, this was only a temporary position, and Mechain was forced to get additional income from teaching mathematics.     In 1774, Mechain obtained the more permanent post as a calculator with the Depot of the Navy. At that time, he has met Charles Messier, who worked for the same department, but at the small observatory at Hotel de Cluny. Apparently, the two astronomers became friends around this time.     On the new post, Mechain was first involved in surveys of the French coastline. In addition, he had occasion to make some observations at Versailles. In 1774, he observed an occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon, which he later presented as a memoir to the Academy of Sciences.     Like Messier, Pierre Mechain became much devoted to comet observing and hunting. Also like Messier, he soon started to stumble over nebulous objects, and between 1779 and 1782, discovered the considerable number of 30 deep sky objects, 29 of which were original firsts. As apparently he had got in close cooperation with Charles Messier at that time, he almost instantly communicated his observations to Charles Messier, who usually checked their positions and added them to his catalog. Both astronomers undertook a vigorous effort to find more nebulae between late August 1780 and March 1781, when the manuscript for the final version of the Messier catalog was sent out to print. Mechain's last two contributions, M102 and M103, went into the publication unchecked and without positions.     Four additional findings of Mechain missed the publication; these are now known as M104, M105, M106, and M107. He communicated them to Bernoulli, the editor of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch, in a letter dated May 6, 1783. As these four objects were not contained in the original Messier catalog, they were longly attributed separately to Pierre Mechain (e.g. by John Herschel and J.L.E. Dreyer, the author of the NGC). In this same letter, Mechain disclaimed - possibly in error - his discovery of M102 as an erroneous re-observation of M101, thereby initiating a still open discussion on the identity of this object.     Mechain discovered his first two comets in 1781, and because of his mathematical skills, he was able to calculate their orbits. He was made a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1782. A third comet followed in 1785, and in 1786, he discovered another one which later became famous as \"Comet Encke\" (after the calculater of its orbit, the German astronomer J.F. Encke). Comet Encke was later independently rediscovered by Caroline Herschel in 1792 and by Pons in 1805, and is the shortest-periodic comet ever discovered, with a period of 3.5 years.     In 1786, Pierre Mechain became an associate editor of the Connaissance des Temps, the journal which had e.g. published the Messier Catalog - one year after Charles Messier had been appointed for the same job.     In 1787, Mechain collaborated with J.D. Cassini and Legendre on measuring the acurate longitude difference between Paris and Greenwich. All three visited William Herschel at his observatory in Slough in the same year.     Mechain discovered his fifth comet in the same year, 1787. His next, 6th discovery occurred in 1790; this finding was periodic comet Tuttle with a period of 13.75 years, as recognized by Tuttle in 1858.     In 1791, a project was initiated of a new survey of the meridian from Dunkirk to Barcelona, and Mechain undertook the southern part, together with an assistant, Tranchot. The operation started June 25, 1792, suffering from various difficulties caused by the French revolution: At one time, Mechain and Tranchot got arrested by revolutioneers in Essone, who first mistook their instruments as weapons, but later let them proceed.     When in Spain, Mechain got hurt in an accident, and when he had recovered, war had broken out between France and Spain, and he got interned. Nevertheless, he discovered another comet, his 7th, from Barcelona on January 10, 1793. During the terror regime in Paris, while Mechain himself was away, all of his property got lost, and his family suffered greatly. Mechain was eventually allowed to leave Spain for Italy, where he stayed at Genoa for some time, and returned to Paris finally in 1795.     On his return, he bacame member of the new Academy of Sciences, and the Bureau of Longitudes. Moreover, he was made director of the Paris Observatory, where he discovered his 8th and last comet on December 26, 1799; Messier took part in observing this one in order to obtain its orbit.     Apparently, Mechain was concerned about the quality of the results of his survey, and refused to publish them for a long time. Eventually, he got permission from Napoleon to extend the survey, and left Paris in 1803.     After completing part of this work, Pierre Mechain caught yellow fever and died in Castillion de la Plana in Spain on September 20, 1804.     Mechain originally discovered 29 deepsky objects, all of which are contained in the modern-version Messier catalog, plus 4 independent co-discoveries; of these he disclaimed one (M102). The four objects which missed the original publication of the Messier catalog, M104, M105, M106, and M107 were eventually added by Camille Flammarion in 1921 (M104) and Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947; the two mentioned with M97 (M108 and M109) by Owen Gingerich in 1953.

This is not the first visit to Croatia for the exhibition Ple\u010dnik on Brioni, the realisation of which was based on cooperation between the National and University Library and the Ple\u010dnik House where it was mounted from January to April 2017. Following the incentive of the City of Zagreb Slovenian National Minority Council, Embassy of the Republic of Slovenia Zagreb and the Slovenski dom, Zagreb association, it was put on display last autumn at The Croatian Museum of Architecture, Zagreb.     The current visit of the exhibition to Vara\u017edin has been supported significantly by the Embassy of the Republic of Slovenia Zagreb and inaugurated by the ambassador Smiljana Knez, PhD. Visitors also had the opportunity to listen to Ana Porok, our museum curator who dedicated her lecture to Ple\u010dnik\u2019s masterful approach to architecture in devising his Ljubljana-based projects, substantiating her absorbing talk by a wealth of visual materials. The opening was also attended by authors of the exhibition, Marijan Rupert and \u017diga Cerkvenik.     Visit our online gallery to see photos from the exhibition opening. "

For genetic analysis (by Hayman, 1954; Jinks,1954) was used line \u2116477 (sp,u), variety Alya (sp) with reduced duration of vegetation period and three collection samples with the high lycopene content in fruits: Dark Green (hp-2dg), \u041c\u041e 112 (hp), \u0422\u02d73627 (Bc). The effects of the general (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) of the duration of vegetation period were determined and established character of inheritance. According to the results of research, the duration of vegetation period is controlled by additive-dominant genetic system. Inheritance occurs by type of over dominance, and in dry and hot summers which led to the prolongation of the duration of vegetation period, there is a tendency to incomplete dominance, but it is apocryphal. In genetic control a major role play non-additive effects of genes. The best reliable effects of the general combining ability (GCA) had line \u2116477 and variety Alya. They can be recommended for the creation of heterotic hybrids and varieties.

Zaradi njihovega pozitivnega aktivizma je pravo, ki ga razlagajo, \u017eivo in razvijajo\u010de se, medsebojna razmerja pa ob\u010dutljiva in zapletena. Razvoj Sveta Evrope in Evropske unije ter obravnava Slovenije pred njunimi sodi\u0161\u010di dajeta trden temelj za sklep, da je varstvo prebivalcev Slovenije vse bolj odvisno od razmerij znotraj evropskega trikotnika.

The Constitutional Court in Ljubljana is influenced and complemented by the Council of Europe with the European Convention on Human Rights and the possibility of lodging an individual complaint in the event of a breach of convention rights to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, as well as by the European Union with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and preliminary issue proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg. Each of the three courts represents a cornerstone and together, they form the European triangle of human rights protection. The catalogue of rights entrusted to them for protection is interpreted broadly, creatively and developmentally. Due to the positive activism, the law that the courts interpret is living and developing, while the mutual relations are sensitive and complicated. The development of the Council of Europe and the European Union as well as the treatment of Slovenia before their courts give a solid foundation for the conclusion that the protection of Slovenes is increasingly dependent on the relations in the European triangle. This master's thesis draws attention to the complexity of the established changes of the Treaty of Lisbon in the European Union as well as the obligations arising from the membership in the Council of Europe, based on which a judge in an ordinary court of law will also serve as a constitutional and European judge. This thesis also advocates a simultaneous reform of the existing mechanisms for the protection of rights at all levels of judicial protection, from ordinary courts of law to constitutional and European courts.

      "text":" Effectiveness of Student Learning during Experimental Work in Primary School     Ana Logar, Cirila Peklaj, Vesna Ferk Savec     Abstract     The aim of the research was to optimize the effectiveness of student learning based on experimental work in chemistry classes in Slovenian primary schools. To obtain evidence about how experimental work is implemented during regular chemistry classes, experimental work was videotaped during 19 units of chemistry lessons at 12 Slovenian primary schools from the pool of randomly selected schools. Altogether 332 eight-grade students were involved in the investigation, with an average age of 14.2 years. Students were videotaped during chemistry lessons, and their worksheets were collected afterward. The 12 chemistry teachers, who conducted lessons in these schools, were interviewed before the lessons; their teaching plans were also collected. The collected data was analyzed using qualitative methods. The results indicate that many teachers in Slovenian primary schools are not fully aware of the potential of experimental work integrated into chemistry lessons for the development of students\u2019 experimental competence. Further research of the value of different kinds of training to support teachers for the use of experimental work in chemistry teaching is needed.

Straight at the entrance, telling who I was, they really received me with open arms. The people of the club showed me the place around and told where I could find the bands. The venue was not that big as it was in a youth center but looked nice and cosy on the inside. A great and promising start, indeed!     Starting of with our masters of black metal from Slovenia, Grob opened this evening. The public was not in numbers there yet but that didn't influence the performance of this band, with full force and with a second guitarist (which makes this band come to better) they gave a show never to forget. As Alan took the lead and growled his way through the songs like Chaos, they took off this opener as it should be, at the middle of the gig even Oelka from Malorshiga showed up to help out with the song Razkol - this song, done with 2 vocalists gives a new edge to it and made this an unforgetable experience.     Next it was time for the masters of black\/death metal from Portugal, Gaerea.     Presenting their first full length album Unsettling Whispers, touring already most of 2019 and still going on with force on stage they gave a hell of a show and in my opinion should have been the headliner of this tour. With masks and strong music but also the vocals are so good combined in this setup, they were giving it all on stage. The vocalist looked like he escaped from a mental asylum. Songs like Whispers, Absent and the masterpiece Catharsis followed by a few songs form their self titled album of 2016 made this gig something to remember and for the people that were to late there a bit of a bummer because they probably missed out on something new and inovating.     At last it was up to the headliner Numenorean to finish the amazing evening in Koper. For me, this band was something new, I never heard of them before and was surprised by the setup of this band, with 3 guitarists and almost all of them at the vocals.     The main vocalist seemed like he was to busy doing everything else but singing and 3 guitarists were (for my personal taste) just to much as a lot of the sound was lost (or was it because of the sound technician or was it the combination of so many instruments and so many vocals, I can't tell for sure, but the sound with the previous bands was perfect). Still this band kept the audience in and some action was finally happening. Slovenians can learn a bit from the rest of Europe to be honest, I was missing the headbanging and for sure the mosh pits.     V petdesetih letih prej\u0161njega stoletja so se v Sovjetski zvezi pojavili nenavadni razpe\u010devalci, ki so glasbo prepovedanih izvajalcev ponujali kar na rentgenskih slikah.     Album Dreaming Neon Black bi zaradi srhljivega ozadja najbr\u017e zlahka uvrstili med najbolj presunljive plate v metalu.     2020 bo o\u010ditno leto temnega vala. Ponovno obujanje \u017eanra darkwave je v polnem zagonu, zanimivo pa je to, da pri nas \u0161e zmeraj primanjkuje tovrstnih glasbenih zasedb.     18 let organiziranja koncertov raznih oblik ekstremne glasbe ni ma\u010dji ka\u0161elj, tako da lahko na tem mestu Dirty Skunksom samo \u010destitamo.     Noctiferia so nastopili suvereno in brez pretenzije, ki spremlja mnogo sodobnega black metala. Na ta na\u010din so se takoj pribli\u017eali ob\u010dinstvu in intimno vzdu\u0161je Ostrige izkoristili sebi v prid.     Da je ve\u010dina obiskovalcev tokrat pri\u0161la zaradi Voivod, je bilo ve\u010d kot jasno in logi\u010dno, vseeno pa se marsikdo zdaj lahko pohvali, da je enkrat v \u017eivljenju dejansko videl Gwar na koncertu.

So far, the co-operation with non-governmental and other organisations active in the field of culture has yielded results and offered new perspectives on both sides. During the time of its existence, the V\u017eigalica Gallery has hosted diverse exhibitions which were either part of larger projects and festivals or independent presentations of major names of world art and young artists, even artists in residence. Apart from that, the Gallery has also been engaged in both domestic and international projects whose production was specially adjusted to the venue. The V\u017eigalica Gallery retains its basic concept of a smaller yet extremely flexible art gallery in the very centre of Ljubljana. Its task will remain to encourage various reactions of both culture and art to the idea of urban culture and, at the same time, to contribute to defining this phenomenon. By making public invitations for projects we aim to encourage the non-governmental sector, artists and other organisations to respond to the phenomena occurring in the urban cultural space in which we live, and to place them in a wider context of contemporary culture and art. The broader context means both an expanded view in the geographical sense, i.e. familiarity with the macrocosmos of international production and the culture of contemporary society at large; as well as the broad-mindedness of the artist\u2019s or curator\u2019s attitude to a certain visual work of art, installation, audio-visual object or performance practice.

Phytoplankton     Climate change     SHORT CV     I was born on the 23.11.1992 in Ljubljana, where I finished high school at Gimnazija Poljane. After graduating I began with my studies of biology at the Biotechnical Faculty of the University of Ljubljana. During my studies I have participated in many workshops and seminars where I deepened my knowledge of life sciences. In the last year of my bachelor\u2019s degree I was accepted to a student exchange in Perth, Australian lead by the European-Australian Network. I spent 5 months in Perth at Edith Cowan University, fulfilling my assignments towards my degree in Biology. Upon returning to Slovenia I started working at the Marine Biology Station in Piran on a student project where we developed a method for fast identification of fish species in food products. Work on this project had lead me to continue my education in marine biology so I applied and was accepted to St Andrews University in Scotland on a Masters course in Ecosystem-based management of marine systems. I spent a year in Scotland and graduated in November 2016 with a thesis titled Investigating immigration as a driver of population growth in the New Caledonian humpback whale breeding grounds using paternity analysis. After finishing my masters, I continued my studies on a PhD programme of Ecotechnology at the Jo\u017eef Stefan International Postgraduate School and started working as PhD candidate at the Marine biology station in Piran, where I am involved in studies of harmful algal blooms and the phytoplankton composition of the Slovenian sea.     OTHER ACTIVITIES     I am a member of the academic assembly of the Jo\u017eef Stefan International Postgraduate school. I frequently write for popular science magazines and websites, where I try to bring my scientific interest to the general public and even children.

I graduated at Guglielmo Oberdan High School and then I proceeded my studies in the University of the Studies of Trieste (UNITS). In 2015 I have complete bachelor studies in Science and Technologies for the Environment and Nature, so my background at this formation level is in natural science. My bachelor final report: Dinamiche a mesoscala di pico-e nanoplancton al largo di Baia Terra Nova (Mare di Ross, Antartide) was the result of the time I spent during a trainee in OGS institute in Trieste. I graduate at Master\u2019 degree level two years later again in Trieste. This time I graduated in Environmental Biology with a thesis titled: Functional redundancy of seagrasses in Mediterranean lagoons: carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles. My master thesis was conducted in the IFREMER institute of Sete (France) during a mobility period of six month financed by the Erasmus+ program. In October 2018 after a mobility period of six months financed by the FVG\u2019s founding program EURES, I started working as young researcher at the National Institute of Biology. I am conducting here the research work for the PhD program of Eco-technology at the Jo\u017eef Stefan International Postgraduate School.

      "text":" Motivation     When it comes to timber as sustainable and renewable construction material, it is usually equivalent to softwood, namely spruce. Hardwoods almost never appear in this context. This is despite the fact that significant amounts of hardwoods are already or will be available, e.g. in France, Germany or Austria due to the ongoing transformation of large areas of forests. It may be assumed that stronger utilization of hardwoods will result in two positive effects: better timber availability on the whole for the wood processing industry and the support of the European forestry strategy to increase the amount of hardwood as targeted in the European and national forest policies. So far, hardwoods have seldom been used for timber structures due to versatile technical challenges, mainly specific species properties, which influence the whole building product chain. It is vital to create the required value added hardwood products to enable the economic and innovative application of hardwoods in the building sector. EU Hardwoods aims at delivering answers to recent questions for the various (production) processes which need to be considered. Appropriate processing will clearly differ from the processing of softwoods. The highest potential in the usage of hardwoods lies most commonly in glued timber products, e.g. glulam (homogenous = all lamellas are of the same species and have the same strength class as well as inhomogeneous = all lamellas are of the same species but have different strength classes) or cross laminated timber. Also hybrid products are in consideration, in which the main part consists of softwood supported by hardwood components utilizing their species dependant characteristics in an optimal way and thereby bolstering the performance of the product. Last but not least, some European hardwood species, e.g. oak, chestnut or black locust, exhibit natural resistances against weathering effects or biological attack comparable to tropical hardwoods. Thus, increased use of these wood species will substitute tropical hardwoods and protect these endangered ecosystems.     State of the art in hardwood application in the building sector     The approach of more extensive use of hardwoods in the building sector started only a few years ago, but the application still requires further development as innovative products are still rare. A small number of projects aiming at product development, technical approval and investigations towards standardisation have been performed so far, building the basis for the proposed project approach. These projects tackled the problems of appropriate strength classification and grading systems for the sawn hardwoods and their further manufacturing to construction components:     a) Hardwoods for construction purposes can be visually graded using national grading rules. EN 1912 allocates national (visual) grades to the European strength class system for hardwoods, i.e. so called \"D\" classes. Besides tropical hardwoods, beech, ash or oak from Germany as well as chestnut from Italy are allocated to strength classes as high as D40. For all other hardwood species and origins this strength classification system cannot be applied due to missing data or allocation.     b) Besides visual grading, the application of machine strength grading would be another option to allocate hardwood species to a specific strength class. However, so far no machine strength grading for hardwoods has been established, not even for glulam lamellas.     c) Only recently some technical approvals have been issued on a national basis regulating the production and design value of some glued hardwood products: Z-9.1-704 (DIBt) Glulam made of oak, Company Gamiz, Spain Z-9.1-821 (DIBt) Glulam made of oak, Company Schiller, Germany Z-9.1-679 (DIBt) Glulam made of beech or hybrid glulam combining beech and softwood, German association of producers of glued laminated timber products, Germany     d) Recently, first national approvals for adhesives have been issued on a national basis providing the evidence to be used for hardwood components, e.g. Z-9.1-807 (DIBt).     e) The former harmonized standard for glulam production EN 14080:2005 offers the possibility to produce CE-marked glulam made of hardwoods by testing of lamellas, finger-joints and whole glulam beams. However, this legal basis for hardwood products expired with EN 14080:2013 \u201cTimber Constructions \u2013 Laminated Timber Requirements\u201d, voted positively in EU formal vote just recently. At the moment, efforts concerning a CUAP (\u201cCommon Understanding of Assessment Procedure\u201d) related to glued hardwoods products are made.     f) In some European countries research related to the use of hardwoods in the building sector has been performed, e.g. allocation of hardwood lamellas to European strength class system, gluing of hardwoods as well as loading capacity of these building construction elements. It has been focused on the main hardwood species, i.e. oak, beech and chestnut, accompanied by some smaller projects on ash or poplar. However, important knowledge gaps in production and characterisation of performance of hardwood glulam still exist, with the consequence that glulam made from hardwood may be manufactured and traded, but still no general admission in building regulations has been achieved such as glulam from softwood, and no discernible increase in the use of hardwoods has been reached so far. An equivalent status is reached for cross laminated timber.     Aims of this project proposal     Previous experience indicates that possible utilisations of hardwoods are engineered products. The use of solid hardwood products is atypical mainly because production to date is too expensive. Therefore, in the future the predominantly manufactured building products made of hardwoods will be hybrid glulam or hybrid cross laminated timber (CLT) consisting of lamellas with smaller cross-sections than solid wood products. To fill the gaps of knowledge and technological developments for a broad application of hardwoods in the construction sector, the following tasks have been identified. This research proposal focuses on beech, oak, ash and Sweet chestnut with the following aspects:     i) Definition of the raw material with respect to availability and log quality. The aim is to define the potential for different roundwood qualities and grades including sawing potential \/ patterns.     ii) Compiling existing and\/or new data to enhance the characterisation of the hardwood species of interest with respect to mechanical properties (strength, modulus of elasticity, density) to complement the database for a grading classification system (visual and machine strength grading) as grading is the pre-requisite to widen the range of applications.     iii) Pre-normative testing and assessment aiming at certification of adhesives for the use with hardwoods.     iv) Development of solutions for the most important building products, respective components and dimensions for: a) finger-joints in solid timber and finger-joints in lamellas, b) homogeneous and inhomogeneous as well as hybrid glulam, c) usage of hardwood glulam in service class 3 for weather exposed outdoor use and cladding.     v) Development of new high-tech products: cross laminated timber as a combination of hardwood and softwood lamellas. E.g. hardwood lamellas from beech can be placed in the inner zone to increase the (rolling) shear capacity in this zone which is often responsible for low strength values of the whole plate. This fact enables the usage of a broad variety of strength grades of hardwoods in high quantity.     vi) Optimisation of the production processes of homogeneous and inhomogeneous glulam and cross laminated timber made from hardwoods on the basis of the results of i) to v) in terms of sawing and gluing.     vii) Derivation of strength models for glulam and cross laminated timber on the basis of strength properties of lamellas and finger-joints, validation through testing (see ii and iii). The main aim is to transfer and complete the knowledge along the whole production line of hardwoods to broaden the use of hardwoods in an efficient and economic way in practice. "

      "text":" Toma\u017e \u0160alamun     Toma\u017e \u0160alamun (photo: Kari Klemel\u00e4)     Toma\u017e \u0160alamun is considered to be one of the fathers of the Slovenian avant-garde and modernist poetry. In the 1970s, when he was a member of the avant-garde group OHO, at the Zagreb exhibition Great-great-grandfathers, he \u201cdrew a line\u201d and discovered art as a relationship between \u201ccan and cannot\u201d, and, at the same time, as a field spreading from the topos of art galleries to the world and human life as a whole. He received many national and international awards for poetry (Pre\u0161eren Prize, Jenko Award, the European Prize for Poetry from the city of M\u00fcnster, a Fulbright scholarship etc.) and is the most translated Slovenian poet. He taught creative writing at two American universities (University of Pittsburgh and University of Massachusetts Amherst, Richmond).     The relationship between \u201ccan and cannot\u201d can be seen in \u0160alamun\u2019s shifts in the Slovenian cultural and social space as follows: \u0160alamun rattled Slovenian poetry in its national and socio-political, internal and external borders, doing so in a manifestly leisurely and playful way; he brought into Slovenian poetry, which was fixated on the concealed crimes of the Second World War, American poetry as a way of seeking something continually new; he brought into his poetry marginal experiences and lifestyles which transgress the patriarcho-tribal tradition. With the principle \u201cI is language\u201d (which, in return, with different modes of speech sometimes shows and sometimes pretends that it has no self), and with lucid humour and various fresh creative concepts, his poetry became key and primary reading for young poets in Slovenia and the former Yugoslavia, regardless of whether they had killed their \u201cfather-idol\u201d or kept him alive.     It is difficult to separate \u0160alamun as a symbolic and almost mythological figure from his poetry. After his first volume of poems, Poker (1966), there came more than forty other volumes of poetry. In the final fifteen years of his life, this poetry moved increasingly into correlation with the pre-lingual and language, and further and further away from thoughts\/meaning and body, much like the way a laboratory instrument records fluctuations of the brain. Is there, in this recording, a necessity, a constant struggle and attempt for the cessation of this last, existential \u201cyou cannot\u201d? Can the field of possibilities continue indefinitely? Is it possible to reach into infinity with the help of language?     This website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.

The author of the exhibition dr. Jedert Vodopivec Toma\u017ei\u010d and her collaborators from the Conservation and Restoration Centre at the Archives of the Republic of Slovenia have based it on the exhibition \u201cHalf a Century\u201d, which was created on the 50th anniversary of the operation of the Book and Paper Conservation and Restoration Centre, and have added new display panels.     This exhibition gives an overview of the activities of conserving and restoring archival material, library material and artistic heritage on parchment or paper over recent decades. It focuses on presenting individual segments of the work of restorers on various types of written and graphic heritage.     At the exhibition you can watch films on the restoration of the Bible by Jurij Dalmatin and of The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola by Janez Vajkard Valvazor.     Also on display is material that has been borrowed for this very occasion from the \u0160krabec Library of the Franciscan Monastery in Kostanjevica in Nova Gorica. This way the exhibition has been enriched with a few extraordinary examples of written material housed by that well-stocked library. Also on display are three incunabula (books printed prior to 1500), the third volume of Valvazor's The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola from 1689, and two other highly interesting publications.     This exhibition commemorates the Year of \u0160krabec, which has been declared by the monastery in Kostanjevica on the 100th anniversary of the death of Father Stanislav \u0160krabec, and the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018.

      "text":" Viva! Snowstorm above Annapurna     Nepal has 2 tourist peaks in its season, where you find ideal conditions for trekking in the mountains. The first one starts in April and lasts till the end of May, the second one starts on October and ends in the end of November. In those time spans, the weather is nicest. But you still have to be prepared for unforeseen surprises. In the middle of October 2014, in the middle of the tourist season\u2019s peak, where was, out of nowhere, a worsening of weather conditions, which took over the region around the middle Nepal Himalayas. Such worsening conditions, although the autumn weather was quite stable that year, is nothing special. But this time, as it hit full-force on the region of the mountain range Annapurna, it was additionally stimulated by the remains of the Hudhud cyclone, which wreaked havoc above the Indian plains. Because of the strong rainfall, even the tourist city of Pokhara, which lies 800m above sea level, suffered broken powerlines thanks to the landslides. On the coast of the Pokhara Lake it even took 4 lives with it.     5400 m high Thorong La Pass, where most of the people in autumn 2014 died. But it was a lot worse for the higher lying regions of the Himalayas. On the well-known trekking road around Annapurna, the heavy snowfall trapped countless hikers. In 24 hours snow accumulated, as deep at 2 meters, and this on 500m above sea level. Better and worse prepared and equipped hikers were, all of a sudden, trapped in perilous situations. Mainly because the snow blizzard, and also because of the wrong decisions some of the guides and hikers on the broad region of Annapurna made, more than 40 people died. About one third of those were foreign tourists, and the other ones their hired carriers, local inhabitants. Everybody that was seized by the heavy blizzard on the upper roads was trying to get to lover grounds to save themselves. The better organized and equipped ones also made it. For many days they made their way through deep snow and fought their way down, all while sustaining heavy frostbite. Some of them were saved from death thanks to the intervention of the Nepal helicopter rescue team.     Even in the deep inners of the valley we still found some remains of landslides. 14 days after the tragedy, I visited this area. The sunny mountainsides around 5400m of the high lying mountain pass Thorong La were already dry. The shady parts of the mountains were still covered in 1 meter deep snow and some parts even more. The tremendous landslides filled the river-bed of Thorong Khola and Marsiandi and covered them with very broad snowy bridges. Witnesses told me how the atmosphere calmed down in an eerie way, just before the catastrophe stroke. The all-time present wind suddenly sufficed. Birds and other animals, which sensed what is coming, fled and brought themselves to safety. As night fell, the inhabitants of the Gundang settlement, 4000m above sea level, saw the first snowflakes falling and started to go to sleep. And as they woke the next morning, the snow accumulated and was already chest-high.     Normal dry and easy roads become quite hard to pass after snow falls. Every accident leaves a deep impression on me, because the Himalayan region is so dear to me. And even more, since the accident had so many dimensions to it. The cause of this sudden change is yet unknown and only hard to pinpoint. But I believe that good organized groups and other hikers, who would have had sufficient equipment and would not have taken the hike lightly, in normal conditions, it would not be such a hard hike to undertake and the victims would be far less. I hope that their tragedy will serve as a good warning for everyone wishing to visit this magical Himalayan region, so that they responsibly prepare themselves for the road and foresee everything, which might take place - even such extreme weather-changing conditions. And of course, that the trekking organizers see these risks in the future and what dangers they pose for the hired carriers and their hikers.     Everyday pastures around the Tilicho Lake were covered in more than 1 and half meters of snow.     Viki Gro\u0161elj     Born 3.6.1952. Sports educator by trade, with 40 years of working in primary schools, but also a top mountain climber, Himalayan, mountain rescuer and mountain guide. Besides countless expeditions to Slovenian and foreign mountains, I also took part on more than 30 expeditions to non-European mountain passes. In the Himalayas, I conquered 11 ascends to 10 out of the 14. mountain tops, ranging over 8000m. "

Today the Academy consists of four departments: the Department of Theatre and Radio, the Department of Film and Television, the Department of Dramaturgy and Performing Arts and the Centre for Theatre and Film Studies.     Contents     Overview     AGRFT offers undergraduate studies in theatre and radio directing, acting, speech training, set design, costume design, dance and movement, stage singing, film directing, television directing, film history, film theory, theory, aesthetics and the history of drama, theatre and audio-visual media in general. During the Academy\u2019s lifetime it has granted more than 400 diplomas to actors, directors and playwrights. The Academy is planning in future to expand its Theatre and Radio Department with a Puppet Theatre programme and its Film and Television Department with programmes on Cinematography, Editing, Sound, Production and Screenwriting.     AGRFT also incorporates the Centre for Theatre and Film Studies which is conceptualised as an information and documentation centre that includes comprehensive libraries of books and other visual materials. It also conducts research projects in the fields of performing arts and audio-visual media.     Each year a total of 20 students of all disciplines enrol at the Academy. The number is limited, mainly due to lack of space and other resources. AGRFT offers a combination of intensive practical skills and theoretical studies in a variety of fields, ranging from philosophy to phonetics. Gradually the Academy has developed the production of short films and radio and television programmes. AGRFT students regularly participate in theatre and film festivals in Slovenia and also abroad, where they have gained enviable successes as well as a high profile for their craft. Each semester the Academy organises several productions in which students present their work. Diploma performances are open to a wide arts audience, and Academy films are broadcast on national television.     Public projects     Since 1995 the Academy bestows the annual Grossmann Award for the best short film script or short TV film screenplay following a competition which is open to students of all Slovene universities. In 2008 AGRFT began publishing Amfiteater Journal of Performing Arts Theory in collaboration with the Association of Theatre Critics and Researchers of Slovenia.     International cooperation     AGRFT is a member of several professional associations: the International Association of Film and Television Schools (CILECT), the International Federation for Theatre Research (FIRT\/IFTR), the European League of Institutes of the Arts (ELIA) and the European Grouping of Film and Television (GEECT). Since 2000 the Academy has been participating in international student and professor exchange programmes such as Erasmus+, CEEPUS and LLP.     The Academy also has established links with other institutions from the area of the former Yugoslavia.

Most of the SHP are located in the Alpine region where the conference will take place, however some 400 small hydropower plants are scattered all over Slovenia. They are mainly micro power plants as the average installed power of them altogether is a mere 200 kW. The majority of the plants were constructed under the favourable legislation of the early 1990s, but some of the older ones have also recently been refurbished.     The study tour will first take us to visit Turboin\u0161titut. This will be a great opportunity to visit one of the only two independent laboratories in the world capable of performing modern acceptance tests according to IEC 60193. With a new supercomputer centre, opened in April 2008, Turboin\u0161titut reached its goal to facilitate scientific progress. The visitors will also see an institute with experience in the development of water turbines and pumps, the refurbishment of old hydropower plant equipment, the development and control of small turbines, the engineering of small hydropower plant equipment, the development and production of special pumps, the low head compressors and aerodynamic devices, as well as performance, cavitation and condition monitoring.     Next we will return towards the Bohinj dead-end valley with its beautiful lake. Then we will stop at two different power plants. The first one is medium to high head and nine years old, and the second is a high head power plant at the bottom of the national symbol waterfall, nearly 100 years old and recently refurbished. This power plant is also interesting because it is positioned in the very heart of the Triglav national park.     Departure: Hotel Golf 09:00, Arrival: Hotel Golf 17:00 "

It is divided into two parts (3a and 3b), each of which is made up of a course book, a workbook and two DVDs with audio and video. The material comprises 10 units that are coordinated with the programme Sloven\u0161\u010dina za tujce and the guidelines specified for this level by the Common European Framework of Reference. Thus in part a, the first two units deal with everyday communication situations, while the following three units offer information about Slovene culture and history, as well as socio-political life in Slovenia and outside it. The units in part b deal with social issues, the media, topical themes in science and the language used in business texts. The final, tenth unit, is aimed at repetition and summarises the themes that have been dealt with. It encourages students to reflect on their language abilities and then presents a series of activities with which they can check how much they have learnt. At the end of both partsthere is also a short orthography. Both course books are further supplemented by a workbook, which contains exercises for reinforcement of the vocabulary, and grammatical and communicational patterns.

      "text":" How can religion and comedy be related if the former tries to keep things untouchable while the latter revels in feeling stuff up? But what if our laughter also idolizes the mocked, admiring their reckless disregard for social norm? And what if, by raising God up as special we also make him a great target for collective mockery? In Sveto in sme\u0161no ('The Holy and the Funny') cartoonist and philosopher Izar Luna\u010dek walks us through the history of both comedy and religion to show that their ancient quarrel might well stem from having grown up in a common household. And assembling an erray of local myths he seeks to demonstrate that the brothers' split is mostly a thing of modern, single-God religions while older and more local faiths liked to let funny gods play in their pantheons and even put them on par with the main deity.     After attaining degrees in painting and philosophy plus a PhD in the latter, Izar Luna\u010dek (1979) left academia to draw comics and organise the local ninth art scene, establishing Ljubljana's central comic book shop and the city's comic festival. This book takes him back to his theorising roots as he takes on the task of presenting a complex, multi-layered topic through a combo of funny pictures and short, sweet sentences. Who knew hard-core philosophy could be this fun to read? If you want to be funny, you need to keep a straight face, while gods usually laugh last ... Still sure you know which is which? "

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

We use novel visualization techniques for presenting different views on the information and enabling efficient navigation through this large information space. In particular, VIDI will provide an efficient toolset for an advance visualization of messages posted in an on-line discussion forum, that will support \"monitoring\u201c and analyzing discussions.

Slovenia pilot use case on-line Citizen's forum European debates     Slovene use case Citizen's forum European debates is providing a national on-line deliberation space for facilitated public debates and consultations on relevant European issues. The main goal of on-line forum is to establish a permanent on-line dialogue between Slovene public (citizens, NGOs , civil society) and European decision-making institutions (primarily Slovene members of the European parliament) on current EU policies and topics. Inputs submitted by the public are summarized into reports by facilitators with the help of VIDI tools and sent to MEPs to provide feedback and mass media. Different web 2.0 application like Facebook, You Tube, RSS and Twitter are used to involve public on-line combined with video streaming and chat rooms covering live events. The on-line Citizen's forum is supported by the European Parliament Information Office in Slovenia and facilitated and administrated by the Institute for Electronic Participation (INePA) which aims to a pilot assessment of e-democratic impacts of on-line forum at the European parliament level.

Text Visualization & Architecture     Visualization is commonly used in data analysis to help the user in getting an initial idea about the raw data as well as a visual representation of the regularities obtained in the analysis. In the case of textual data, visualization can help understanding, discovery and summarization the topics which are discussed in the text. If the time dimension is present in the data, this can be used to further show how specific topics emerge or disappear through time. Visualization can further help understand the context and relationships of objects (named-entities), which are described in a text corpus. The main challenge in the visualization of a document corpus is to map all the documents into a two dimensional vector space so we can plot them on a computer screen. Ideally they would be positioned in such a way that the distance between two documents would correspond to the content similarity between them. In the case that the time plays an important role, the visualization approach reflects this dimension as well. VIDI platform consists of four main components, which will be generally described in the following text: Crawler, Feature Extractor, Analyzer and Visualizator.

      "text":" More than 10 000 patients have been treated with electroporation-based treatments in more than 150 hospitals in Europe after the development of the first clinical device in 2006, comparable values are also for USA. Moreover, there are currently ongoing tens of clinical trials worldwide evaluating electroporation-based treatments.     In electroporation-based treatments, the electroporation pulses have fundamental frequency of 5 kHz or lower. The tissues in the body have at these frequencies a large impedance range. The electric field distribution in the body is thus very inhomogeneous during the delivery of classical electroporation pulses. Because of the inhomogeneous electric field distribution inside the body, the effects of electroporation-based treatments are also inhomogeneous in the body and thus less effective. Electroporation-based treatments thus require extensive numerical optimizations to cover the entire treatment area with sufficient electric field. At higher pulse frequencies tissues in the body have a smaller impedance range, and recent studies suggest that with shorter high-frequency bipolar electroporation pulses, electroporation of the tissues in the body could be more homogeneous, and that high-frequency electroporation pulses can achieve effective treatment without muscle contraction.     Our group regularly follows the development of commercial and laboratory prototype electroporation devices and we conclude that the first problem arises as there are no suitable electroporation devices for thoroughly analysing the effects of high-frequency electroporation pulses. The second problem arises as some groups independently to high-frequency treatments researchers concluded that high-frequency bipolar electroporation pulses can cause cancellation effect. Therefore we will develop a new prototype electroporation device that will generate high-frequency monopolar, bipolar and asymmetric bipolar electroporation pulses from 100 ns to 1 ms pulse duration, pulse amplitude up to 4 kV, and pulse repetition rate up to 5 MHz. For the first time, we will analyse thoroughly the high-frequency electroporation pulses in vitro as well as in vivo. Current electroporation models for electric field distribution in tissue are stationary and the changing of tissue impedance with the frequency of the pulses is not included. We will develop a new model in frequency domain and include the frequency characteristics of the tissue, and thus more precisely determine the electric field distribution of the high-frequency electroporation pulses in the tissue. Previous studies suggest a presence of cancellation effect in the field of high-frequency electroporation pulses. We will analyse thoroughly the range of electroporation pulse parameters and determine the equivalent parameters of high-frequency electroporation pulses regarding currently used classical electroporation pulses. We will systematically analyse the findings that the high-frequency electroporation pulses distribute in the tissue more homogeneously than classical electroporation pulses by indirect observation of electric field distribution using magnetic resonance imaging, and the findings that at the equivalent high-frequency electroporation pulses do not cause muscle contractions and pain by quantitative evaluation of muscle contractions and unpleasant sensations.     The expected results would significantly influence the development of current electroporation-based treatments because they would improve coverage of the entire treatment area with sufficient electric field. This would most likely increase the efficiency of the treatments, reduce the scattering of the results and simplify the treatment planning. The expected results would also reduce the muscle contraction and excitation of nerves and thus reduce the unpleasant sensations, movement of tissue and electrodes during the treatment, and improve the safety of treatments close to nerves.     Organization of the project is closely linked to the objectives pursued. The principal research institution in the project is the University of Ljubljana (UL), Faculty of Electrical Engineering, one of the leading research institutions in the world in the field of new electroporation devices, modelling electric field distribution and in vitro electroporation experiments. In addition, the principal research institution has prominent experience in analysis of tissue impedance, muscle contractions and unpleasant sensations due to electroporation pulses. The collaborating research institution is the Jozef Stefan Institute (IJS) which is one of the leading research institutions in the world in the field of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of electroporation effects. In the field of the action potential, muscle contractions and unpleasant sensations we will collaborate with dr. Rodney Philip O\u2019Connor acknowledged expert in the field of neurophysiology and neurobiology with whom UL cooperates on bilateral project. Animal work will be performed in collaboration with Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia that has many years of experience with animal work, and with whom UL regularly cooperates. With dr. Rodney Philip O\u2019Connor from \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Mines de Saint-\u00c9tienne, France and with prof. Gregor Ser\u0161a from Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia we have signed a \u00bbletter of intent\u00ab to collaborate in the proposed project. The participating research institutions are complementary and highly competent in theoretical and practical knowledge regarding issues to be investigated.     Effective management of knowledge and exploitation will be assured as well as compliance with provisions of ARRS projects. The project leader is responsible for:     overall management of the project,     preparation of the meetings,     timely execution of tasks defined in WPs and preparation of reports,     timely delivery of all data identified as deliverables, and     control of the budget.     The work on the proposed project will be organised in five work packages (WP):     In Work package 1 of the project, we will develop a new prototype electroporator that will allow systematic analysis of the high-frequency pulses in vitro (WP 3) and in vivo (WP 4; described in WP 1). In Work package 2 of the project we will develop a new frequency-domain electroporation model that will allow calculation of the distribution of the electric field in the inhomogeneous tissue. The tissue model will be built by means of magnetic resonance imaging (WP 4) and validated by in vitro (WP 3) and in vivo experiments (WP 4; described in WP 2). In Work package 3 of the project, we will use the new prototype electroporator developed in WP 1 to systematically analyse in vitro the effect of the high-frequency electroporation pulses on permeabilization, molecular transport, and cell survival. Comparing the results with classical electroporation, we will also define equivalent high-frequency electroporation pulses that will be used in WP 4 (described in WP 3).     In Work package 4 of the project, we will first submit applications to obtain permits for the experiments in WP 4. The application should be submitted at least one year before the planned experiments. In case of complication with one of the application we have 6 months of reserve. After we will obtain the permissions for the experiments and develop the new prototype electroporator in WP 1, we will start with the in vivo experiments. By means of magnetic resonance imaging, we will define the mice leg tissue structure for the numerical model in WP 2, compare the electric field distribution of classical electroporation pulses with equivalent high-frequency electroporation pulses determined in WP 3. Within this work package, we will also determine whether high-frequency electroporation pulses have a less significant effect on muscle contraction and unpleasant sensations compared to classical electroporation pulses. After finishing all the experiments in this project, we will take into account all the results obtained in WP 2, 3 and 4, and define the guidelines for more efficient and less painful electroporation-based treatments (described in WP 4).     In Work package 5 of the project, we will seek the opportunities to protect new knowledge and disseminate results to potential partners in industry. Also, regular meetings and financial reporting to ARRS agency will be organized. By tightening the cooperation between both partners, the project will serve as a base for the preparation of spin-off proposal for international calls, in particular for Horizon 2020 (described in WP 5).

      "text":" Catfishing in Spain: Ultimate River Ebro Fishing Guide     When it comes to catfishing, river Ebro is the best location in Spain, and one of the best in Europe. Keep on reading to find out all you need to know.     Located on the Iberian Peninsula, Ebro river is the longest river flowing entirely within the Spanish borders.     From the source until it reaches the sea, this river flows through multiple towns, and attracts tourists from all over the world.     More importantly, Ebro river is a famous fishing location. It is home to carp, various predatory fish, even some endemic fish species, but most of all to enormous wels catfish and channel catfish.     When it comes to catfishing, river Ebro is the best location for catfishing in Spain, and one of the best in Europe.     It is ideal for both experienced anglers and beginners.     There are numerous tourist agencies located nearby, offering unforgettable fishing experiences.     If you are in a search for excellent catfishing location, keep on reading to find out everything you need to know about catfishing in Ebro river.     Where and when to catfishing on Ebro river     If you are not sure where to go and you don\u2019t want to be bothered with searching for a perfect spot, you can always contact a local agency to book a fishing trip.     Location     For the ones more adventurous, there is no limit.     Catfish can be found in usual places such as deep holes, covered and protected area, shelves and ponds. Crowded locations should be avoided if possible.     Some anglers even use online maps and satellite images of the area to choose a location.     Wels catfish can be found along the whole river length but the lower river is home to some really huge specimens.     Catfish that weigh more than 100 pounds are quite frequent. Some specimens were more than 250 centimetres long, weighing more than 200 pounds.     It is hard to single out the best locations, but according to some experienced anglers, you should try fishing near Mequineza village, where fish live in smaller number, but they are greater in size.     Another good location is near Caspe village.     Large fish move around, and some anglers choose location where river is not so wide so that they can intercept them, as they are able to cover the whole area.     Season     When talking about seasons, some are better than other for catfishing in Spain.     Autumn, from September to November, is good because of the river level, which is stable. Also, fish are trying to feed as much as they can to gain weight for winter.     With lowering temperatures, just before winter, fish activity is getting low.     In winter, from December to February, catfishing is possible but the fish are less active. Still, some large catfish specimens were caught in winter. River level slightly rises, and outside temperatures are pleasant.     During spring, from March to May, weather can be unpredictable but it gets warmer. Spring floods can occur. Fish are becoming more active and during this time you can catch a lot of catfish, including trophy size. Catfish spawning season is in May. There is no closed fishing season during spawn, but it can be challenging to catch them at that time.     Summer, from June to August is the best time to fish for catfish. After spawn season they start to feed aggressively and their activity is at the highest point.     River Ebro fishing is spectacular no matter the location and anywhere you go, you will have a very exciting fishing holiday.     This river is wild, water levels vary and stormy weather can occur because of its geographical position.     Best Gear and Technique for Catfishing in Spain     Before heading to the water, make sure you are well-equipped.     Some anglers have heavy-duty fishing gear, necessary for trophy size catfish, but others should consider booking a guide and renting the equipment.     Bait and lures     One of the most effective ways of catching a huge catfish is with halibut pellets.     This frequently used method is similar to fishing with boilies. Anglers hair-rig the bait, or multiple baits, on a ledger rig. The only difference is the gear. Bigger rods and catfishing reels are required.     Catfish have excellent sense of smell so try using very smelly pellets or boilies.     Excessive baiting is not allowed but keep in mind that this river is very big and wild. You will need a serious amount of bait if you want to be successful. Few kilograms per rod during one day is a quantity you will need for large catfish.     If you want an extra challenge, try fishing with spinning rod and reel and lures, especially ones that are very loud and make a lot of vibrations. Catfish are very sensitive to vibration and correctly presented lure will seem like a prey. They should be casted in strong currents.     Rod and reel     When it comes to rods and reels, rule is the bigger the better.     Strong and powerful rods should be combined with big pit reels with free spools. Main lines should be 500 meters long and 0,4 millimetres in diameter.     As the river currents are strong, leads should weigh at least 250 grams.     Shock leaders are mandatory because the river bottom is full of mussels that cut the lines. It should be about 5 metres long and 0,6 millimetres in diameter.     Catch and Release fishing on river Ebro     There are two main reasons why catfish are growing huge in Ebro river.     One of them is geographical; average water temperatures are higher than in rivers where we usually find catfish. That means they can feed trough the year, without long winter break. Catfish are not native to Ebro river. They were introduced more than 30 years ago.     Other reason is Catch and Release fishing. Anglers catch huge specimens, take a picture and release them back into the water. Those specimens can spawn and produce new fish who are likely to inherent the size.     Also, releasing huge fish is good for tourist business.     Tips and Tricks for Ebro river fishing     No one knows every tiny detail about river Ebro fishing, but here are some tips for first-timers visiting this extraordinary location.     Catfish behaviour     Catfish are keeping close to each other, and they can travel long distance searching for food.     Some anglers wrongly think they are lazy and spend time in the same hole all the time. Mullet fish is their favourite food and mullets live in the lower 30 miles of Ebro river. Some places can be completely vast, and in another abundance of catfish appear. They are attracted to stream inlets, slacks and sewer outfalls. Catfish will feed aggressively in those locations, especially in the afternoon.     Catfish location regarding to river flow     Avoid middle part of the river. Water is cooler due to strong currents and greater depths. Try to find a line where fast river flow meets margin slack.     Night Fishing     Try to find a location where night fishing is legal.     Most of the river Ebro fishing takes place during the day. One reason is that in some parts night fishing is forbidden. Other reason is that tourists who are paying day trips fish during the day.     Catfish are very active during night and because less anglers present their baits at that time, your chances become higher.     Fishing companion     This may seem a bit silly, but if it is your first time trying to catch a trophy size catfish, you should think about handling that enormous catch. That is not the same as a few kilograms fish on a local pond.     If there is a chance you will catch something too large to handle by yourself, make sure you have a helper. It would be a shame to lose a catch of a lifetime!     Best time to fish for catfish     Don't forget about that - some times and seasons are better than other for catfishing.     In order to find out what is the best time to fish for catfish, keep watching the video and improve your chances to catch a big one!     Rules and regulations for catfishing on river Ebro     Rules and regulations for river Ebro fishing, depending on location, are under two regulatory bodies.     One is Catalonia, and other one is Aragon.     Both are able to issue a fishing permit, which is mandatory for every angler.     Having a valid licence is mandatory, same as having a fishing ticket. Licences can be obtained online and day tickets are sold in various places near the river.     If fishing from a boat near to Catalonia-Aragon border, it can be hard to determine which licence and day ticket anglers need.     In Aragon, fishing is permitted from sunrise until 10 PM, while in Catalonia anglers can fish 24 hours a day.     Catalonian and Aragon licences have some differences, and you should familiarise yourself with both.     Some of the most important rules are the following:     \u2022 Using live bat is not allowed. \u2022 Sardines are the only allowed dead fish baits. \u2022 Fishing nets are not allowed, same as keeping live fish in them. \u2022 Excessive prebaiting is forbidden. \u2022 Every angler can have up to two fishing rods.     While catfishing in Spain, make sure you obey all the rules and regulations.     Conclusion     Catfishing in Spain, on Ebro river, is one of the most exciting fishing experience anglers can have.     Wide choice of fishing locations provides endless possibilities for everyone\u2019s taste. Enormous wels catfish, especially in the lower river parts are real fighters on the hook.     Dozens of nearby towns and villages offer accommodation options for multiple day fishing. Life around the river is organised in a way that fishing is always within a reach.     River Ebro fishing requires skill, experience and strong equipment. For less experienced anglers, numerous agencies offer single or multiple day fishing trips, together with equipment or boat rental.     Make sure you obey the rules and regulations and enjoy fishing trip od a lifetime!

An interdisciplinary team consisting experts in optoelectronics, plasma science, plasma technology and sensor technology will be established. The team will consist of partners from a university, a public research institute, a private research centre and an industrial partner. The team will construct a sensor suitable for data acquisition in a time scale of about 100 ms with the sensitivity of about 1 nm. The sensor will be first tested in a small experimental system for reactive sputter deposition available at the University. Prototypes will be then validated in a system for PECVD deposition of thin films using hexamethyl di-siloxane precursor at the Institute, and further validated in a 5 cubic meters large system for PECVD deposition of thin silicon dioxide layers on polymeric components of complex shape and rather large size. This system is used routinely for depositing protective layers on head lamps for automotive industry. The experts from the private research centre will construct an appropriate power supply including electronics for automatic data acquisition. The deliverable of this applied research project will be therefore an industrial prototype of a sensor ready for use in PECVD reactors worldwide. The original solution will be protected with a patent application, while the scientific aspect will be disseminated by papers submitted to prominent topical journals as well as through presentations at plasma conferences. The co-funding organization and beneficiary of this project will be able to commercialize the sensor soon after accomplishing this project. The sensor will be flexible enough for application in plasma reactors of various sizes using different discharges for sustaining non-equilibrium gaseous plasma. It will be small and will represent a price-effective alternative to standard methods for in-situ measuring thicknesses of thin films upon deposition in plasma reactors. "

EngD thesis.     Abstract     The aim of this work was to improve the system Algator in the part, which deals with the analysis and presentation of data. First, we compared some query languages to find the most suitable for use in the system Algator. Algator stores data in a specific format, and the data are always combined in the same fashion. Therefore, special query language is more suitable because it can take advantage of these properties. We determined the simplified syntax of SQL and used in the system Algator. User interface and converter from JSON format to a simplified SQL and vice versa has been developed. Execution of queries has been optimized because some inquiries run too long. Functionality of calculated fields has been added, which allows to add additional fields that are calculated from other fields. "

This time the theme of Svyatoslav\u2019s speech will be \u201cChange management. Strategy in a changing world\u201d.     Blog articles     When I start the first conversation with a prospect, a potential customer, I always ask them: who are your clients? And often I hear something like this: \u201cwe work in the B2B market, so our customers are industrial (or trade, retail, logistic, etc.) companies\u201d. This approach is extremely dangerous. There are no \u201cfirms\u201d or \u201ccompanies\u201d.\u2026 read more     Peter Drucker (who, by the way, called himself an \u201cinsultant\u201d rather than a \u201cconsultant\u201d) liked to ask people: \u201cWhy does a business exist?\u201d. And if he heard an answer: \u201ca business exists for the sake of the net profit,\u201d he concluded: \u201cYou know nothing about business\u201d.

Dejstvo, da je izsledkov o pomlajevanju po velikopovr\u0161inskih motnjah v pragozdovih malo, nas je vodilo k temu, da smo leta 2000 analizirali stanje indinamiko pomlajevanja vrzeli. Na treh razli\u010dnih delih vrzeli smo postavili 15 raziskovalnih ploskev z dimenzijami 15 x 15 metrov, znotraj katerih smo analizirali zmes, razrast dreves, sestojno stanje po IUFRO klasifikaciji, pomladek in grobe lesne ostanke. Posebej nas je zanimalo razmerje med bukvijo (Fagus sylvatica L.) in gorskim javorjem (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). Slednjega je najve\u010d na sredini vrzeli. Pod sestojem, ki je zapolnil vrzel, je razvit pomladek bukve in javorja, ki je najgostej\u0161i na spodnjem (severnem) delu vrzeli. V pomladku prevladuje bukev. Ugotovili smo, da so bile razmere, ki so se izoblikovale po vetrolomu, bistveno druga\u010dne od tipi\u010dnega goloseka. Predstavili smo tudi uporabne izsledke za gospodarjenje v gozdovih na podobnihrasti\u0161\u010dih.Special attention is given to the gap, which was created in the virgin forest remnant Ravna gora in 1983 by wind throw. The gap in the optimal phase of almost pure beech and on beech site (Cardamini savensi-Fagetum) was 5.17 ha large. In 2000, owing to a lack of investigations in such conditions, we started to research the development patterns of natural regeneration within the gap. 15 sample plots (15 x 15 m) in three different positions within the gap were established. We analysed tree species mixture, architecture, stand structure according to IUFRO classification, advanced regeneration density andcoarse woody debris.The reserach concentrated in particular on the variability of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) mixture in regard to theposition within the gap. It was found out that sycamore was more abundant than beech in the center of the gap. The advanced regeneration density of beech was much higher than sycamore's, and both species were more abundant in the northern part of the gap. The results suggest that the ecological conditions after the wind throw were different when compared to a clear-cut area of similar size. Useful results for managed forests on similar sites are also presented.

The average surface area of fenced areas is 0.71 ha. Using the pair comparison technique (fenced vs. unfenced areas), the structureand the composition of the natural regeneration of tree species as well as complete shrub and herb vegetation were analysed in the research site Trnovec. Furthermore, the vegetation was investigated using the Braun-Blanquetmethod. The research results show significant differences between fenced and unfenced areas, both in tree species composition and in theheight structure of the sapling community. In fenced areas the total numberof saplings taller than 50 cm is higher and an increase is also evident in the number of saplings of silver fir Abies alba, sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, elm Ulmus glabra and other minor tree species. There are also significant differences in species composition and in the abundance of plant species in the herb layer. The results show that natural regeneration of Dinaric fir-beech forests is successful, provided the influence of ungulates is excluded.

Soil cores of equal volume (274 ml, 0 - 18 cm deep) weretaken from 33 sampling plots. In the samples all the roots were counted and types of ectomycorrhizae briefly characterized. From these data diversity indices (species diversity (d) and Shannon- Weaver index of diversity (H)) were calculated. Interactions among mycorrhizae, light regime and survival of spruce seedlings were studied. Out of about 50,000 root tips approximately 1 %were non-mycorrhizal, 63 % were old unviable mycorrhizae and 36 % were identifiable ectomycorrhizal root tips, forming 27 different types of ectomycorrhizae. Sixteen types of ectomycorrhizae were briefly characterized. The Shannon diversity index for types of ectomycorrhizae was high (3.13) with respect to the above-ground diversity of vegetation (1.7). The direct site factor was shown to be negatively correlated to ~Piceirhiza cornuta. The diffuse site factor was negatively correlated to Cortinarius sp. (obtusus type) and positively correlated to Inocybe sp. The ground vegetation cover waspositively correlated to Piceirhiza gelatinosa and the total vegetation cover to Elaphomyces sp.

Three phytocoenological relev\u00e9s were carried out, all trees ?5 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) were measured by full callipering, tree growth was analysed for sample trees, regeneration of tree species was registered on 63 sampling plots. In addition, historical data from past forest inventories werestudied. In the period from 1952 to 2003, the share of silver fir has decreased from 86% to 26%, the share of Norway spruce increased significantly,whereas the share of beech and sycamore has slightly increased. The current growing stock amounts to 350 m3 ha-1, with large-size diameter trees (d.b.h. ?50 cm) representing 51% of total growing stock. The site is divided into 16 stand patches with significant differences in tree species composition and diameter distribution. Regeneration is sufficient with silver fir prevailing in total number of seedlings (42%). 23% of all seedlings are damaged as a result of game browsing.

Seveda, dokler zares ne izide ...tralala... sploh pa tako \u0161iroko zastavljen projekt. Kljub temu se mi zdi ta projekt vreden predstavitve, ker je res dodelan v nulo . Presenetil nas je \u017ee na FS konferenci v Munchnu pred pol leta ko smo takrat med predstavitvijo pobirali \u010deljusti s tal.     SStusek napisal\/-a:     nas je pa brez besed (vsaj mene) pustila predstavitev FSLabs-ovega novega Airbusa A320 imenovanega A3xx Master Series, ki je grajejen na podlagi podatkov A320 Class D simulatorjev in upo\u0161teva vse mo\u017ene parametre... Model si s pravim Airbusom deli kar nekaj re\u0161itev v smislu povezovanja modulov, ki takoreko\u010d vsi te\u010dejo izven FSX-a.     Posnetek predavanj s FS konferenci v Munchnu:     _________________ Ahhhh! the madness of cockpit builders will never end. SIMon A320     Pridru\u017een: 14 Nov 2006, 14:13 Prispevkov: 489 Kraj: Ljubljana     Samo za poku\u0161ino, kako detajlno je izdelan sistem goriva.     Andrew Wilson napisal\/-a:     I thought some of you might be interested in a few more details about our A320-X, and write a little about the fuel system we have modeled.     I've mentioned before that we've designed a fluid dynamics simulation to model aircraft fuel, bleed air and hydraulics - it is actually adapted from a similar model we use to simulate electric current throughout the aircraft. This system allows us to simulate, for example, an accurate model of fuel pressure and temperature propagation through the aircraft.     What we're also doing is simulating our fuel tanks in 3 dimensions. Most aircraft products for MSFS only simulate a fuel tank using the default coordinate system that FSX provides. Our fuel tanks on the A320-X are more than just a point in space, we actually calculate where the fuel is inside the tank - how it reacts to pitch, roll and acceleration.     Why have we done this? Well - the A320 fuel system comprises of around 30 fuel sensors (all of which are modeled), and their resistance is measured by the Fuel Level Sensing Control Units. From this resistance the FLSCUs can deduce if the sensor is wet or dry and through a series of logic gates, controls various valves in the fuel system. Such valves include the wing tank transfer valves, that latch open to allow the transfer of fuel from the outer wing tanks, to the inner wing tanks where the main fuel pumps feed the engines. The logic gates in the FLSCUs command the transfer valves to open if any one of the inner wing tank low level sensors become dry.     Now here's where it gets interesting and where our 3D fuel tanks come into play: two of the fuel low level sensors are situated on the rear spar of the wing inside the inner wing tank. If the aircraft pitches down, for example at top of descent and the fuel level in the inner wing tank is within a few hundred kilos of the low level, there is a good chance that the sensors on the rear spar will become dry and the FLSCUs will command the wing transfer valves to latch open early.     This isn't documented in the FCOM or AMM; but it occurs quite often on the real aircraft. And because we have modeled the Flight Sim Labs A320-X in such intricate detail, you can expect to see the same thing happen in our simulation.     _________________ Ahhhh! the madness of cockpit builders will never end.

The split into 2 versions is the result of - licensing conflicts (FSX is an \"entertainment\" platform, the \"professional version\" will feature a training\/commercial licence) - FSX limitations that prevent many features or are complicating the programming of those - the price of such \"professional version\", which also requires a certification process if it's meant to be used for training purposes.     What are the differences? - Both versions will feature mostly the same aircraft in terms of aircraft systems and sytem behaviour - The major difference will be the presence of a failure generator\/instructor station for the \"professional version\" but also some other features that are intended for pilots and enthusiasts. - In contrast to that, there will be no option to trigger failures in the \"entertainment version\", despite there will be an option to switch on a failure engine that triggers failures on its own. Those failures can then be handled like in the real aircraft (ECAM, etc.) in both versions. -The occurrence of failures in the \"entertainment version\" will be depending on aircraft handling, environment conditions and the probability for a specific failure in the real aircraft.(hot\/hung starts, ignition failures, compressor stalls and many others) - Multicrew is planned to be included in the \"professional version\"     Panels - Full set of 2D-panels - Captain and first officer view - IFR and VFR panel version (small or full ECAM view) - All displays are pop-able and sizeable - EIS2 LCD layout     Systems - Every \"flight sim related\" system is simulated (but not the coffee machine in the galley ) - Custom coded 3D fuel system simulating realistic fluids behaviour, depending on various environment factors - Custom coded engine simulation, fully independent from FSX > realistic single engine taxi possible - Systems following various ARINC-specifications: ARINC429 (with ARINC 600\/615 data stream support), ARINC 424 protocols, and RS422 (with ARINC 600 support) that are also used in the real aircraft - Accurate simulation of the different electric and hydraulic systems - A \"system behind the systems\" that simulates the data flow\/connections like in the real aircraft - Complete custom coded FBW system - Extremely accurate lift and drag simulation based on comprehensive data from various visits of Level-D simulators and real flights and also running outside of FSX - recreating the EIS2 (LCD-Screens, updated systems, etc.) - System simulation that is running outside of FSX is supporting multi core CPUs and also uses the GPU - Full recreation IRS system with position drift and GPS update when able - Recreation of system behaviour that isn't documented in the FCOM but existing in the real world     Sound - Innovative 3D sound design that allows the developer to place sounds at specific points in space - Based on various high quality recordings     Virtual Cockpit and Exterior Model - Presence of a mix of painted and photo real textures, resulting in a immersive and realistic look - High resolution exterior model (e.g. writings below the static ports are readable) - Virtual cabin viewable from the outside - Visible simulation of wear and tear in VC and 2D cockpit depending on the time of use     Miscellaneous - Comprehensive set of manuals and tutorials - Different saved flight states - Different liveries of the most common airlines flying the A320 in the real world available on release - Other Airbus models (A319, A321) are planned as seperate products in the future, A318 depending on the consumer demand - A330 and\/or later A340 might be an option for the far future. - Navdata will be provided by any company that licenses the FSLabs data converter for ARINC 424 text files     Release - Release of the \"entertainment version\" is planned to be around november\/december 2012, (Mr. Kalamaras at the flightsim conference in Munich 2012) Remember: This can always be subject to change     Pricing - Not definded yet (verjetno v rangu PMDG)     _________________ Ahhhh! the madness of cockpit builders will never end.

      "text":" The debris of a rocket fell to Earth on Sunday     Something went wrong with the take-off of a Chinese rocket on April 29th this year.     Part of the rocket fell off too quickly on take-off and began to fall to Earth.     When a rocket takes off into space, it usually sheds some of its parts during its flight through the atmosphere. Because of the lower mass, it uses less fuel when accelerating.     Parts that fall off at the beginning usually fall to Earth in a certain controlled area where they do not pose a danger.     Those that fall high enough, however, remain in the orbit and do not fall to Earth.     Due to an error, part of the Chinese rocket remained too close to Earth and began to fall back. This part weighed as much as 21 tons and flew at a speed of about 28 thousand kilometres per hour.     At such a high speed, it was difficult for researchers to predict the exact location of the fall back to Earth.     \u00bbWe predicted that the fall would happen somewhere around the equator, at most to the north to Rome or to the southern coast of Montenegro,\u00ab says Prof. Dr. Toma\u017e Zwitter from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics.     The debris of the rocket fell into the Indian Ocean west of the Maldives on Sunday, May 9th, at 3.24 pm our local time.     Uncontrolled falls of massive bodies do not happen often.     \u00bbAccording to the rules, before entering the atmosphere the body must be broken into several smaller pieces with an explosive charge, which then all burn without difficulty and therefore nothing falls to the ground,\u00ab says Zwitter.     Even before the fall of the debris of the rocket, Toma\u017e Zwitter believed that they did not pose a major danger.     \u00bbWalking on the sidewalk along the road is much more dangerous, as many accidents happen around the world every day. So no worries and just bravely go on!\u00ab     Points to Consider     What is gravity?     Why do bodies burn when they fall to Earth?

Fairs and events are about the same as in previous years, unknown are the Corona virus and measures that can prevent the event at the last moment.     List of exhibitions \/ fairs, where I will present in 2021 was made, most of the weekend are occupied, invitations to the other exhibitions \/ fairs , I politely refuse.As I have said many times and wrote: too many exhibitions \/ fairs and too few Saturdays and Sundays during vegetation, in order to attend all.     I will try to be present at the most interesting with the various plants events \/ fairs. I try to ensure the presence in Austria, Italy and Germany with my plants.     In the past years, I attended quite a lot fairs (exhibitions) of rare plants. Actually enough, I have created a picture of gardening fairs and \"gardening fairs\". As a participant in these events, I had the opportunity to meet many gardeners and visitors. In conversation with them, we found many interesting topics and information.     The most important thing is, in any case, a common finding that the offer at many fairs is similar to the offer in the shopping and garden centers. Gardeners who are concerned with their own education and selection of plants is less every year. Many gardeners come to trade fairs to sell their things (plants), but not to dismantle, advise and recommend them. There is less and less chance for visitors to learn about new or rare plants, get to know them, and maybe also put them in a garden. Successful fairs (exhibitions) are the same where both aspects of both exhibition and sales are intertwined. And interestingly, in spite of the plethora of gardeners, horticultural plants that appear on exhibitions, we are familiar with each other, we meet at fairs and exchange information and information on plants and interesting events.     Some fairs (exhibitions) are mandatory for gardeners who put something on themselves; you go to some to get to know new people. Each of the fairs (exhibitions) has its demands and visitors. One admired Begonia and Fuchsia, the second only a week later, nobody looks at these plants, even if I would add some money on plants . What astonishes people is a nice saying, which is also true at trade shows.     Seznam razstav\/sejmov, kjer bom sodeloval in razstavljal v letu 2018 je narejen, ve\u010dina terminov je zasedenih,vabila na ostale razstave\/sejme, ki jih dobivam pa vljudno zavra\u010dam. Kot sem \u017ee ve\u010dkrat povedal in zapisal :preve\u010d razstav\/sejmov in premalo sobot in nedelj v \u010dasu rastlinske vegetacije, da bi se udele\u017eil vseh.     Pomembna dopolnitev Eden od organizatorjev sejmov je spremenil datume dveh sejmov. POPRAVKI SO NA DANA\u0160NJI DAN(20.1.2018) \u017dE UPO\u0160TEVANI.     List of exhibitions \/ fairs, where I worked and exhibited in 2018 was made, most of the slots are occupied, invitations to the other exhibitions \/ fairs , I politely refuse.As I have said many times and wrote: too many exhibitions \/ fairs and too few Saturdays and Sundays during vegetation, in order to attend all.     I try to be present at the most interesting and with the plants of various events \/ fairs. I try to ensure the presence in Italy, Austria and Germany with my plants.     An important addition One of the organizers of the fairs changed the dates of two fairs. THE CORRECTIONS AT THE TODAY (20.01.2018) HAVE BEEN TAKEN.     Also, the transfer of a nursery from Maribor (55 km in one direction) to the location of the garden took quite a few dates in 2018.

Kot sem \u017ee ve\u010dkrat povedal in zapisal :preve\u010d razstav\/sejmov in premalo sobot in nedelj v \u010dasu rastlinske vegetacije, da bi se udele\u017eil vseh.     18. in 19. marec Nel gardino del doge \u2013villa Manin (Italija) http:\/\/www.villamanin.it     8. april Pflanzenmarkt und Rarit\u00e4tenb\u00f6rse - Botani\u010dni vrt Linz(Austrija) www.linz.at\/umwelt\/85775.asp     Razstave in sejmi 2016     Vrtni sejmi in prireditve     V preteklem letu sem se udele\u017eil kar nekaj sejmov(razstav) redkih rastlin. Pravzaprav dovolj, da sem si ustvaril sliko o vrtnarskih sejmih in \" vrtnarskih sejmih\" . Kot sodelujo\u010di na teh prireditvah, sem imel prilo\u017enost spoznati mnogo vrtnarjev in obiskovalcev. V pogovoru z njimi smo na\u0161li veliko zanimivih tem in informacij.     Najpomembnej\u0161a je vsekakor skupna ugotovitev, da postaja ponudba na mnogih sejmih podobna ponudbi v trgovskih in vrtnih centrih. Vrtnarjev, ki bi se ukvarjali z lastno vzgojo in izborom rastlin je vsako leto manj. Veliko vrtnarjev pride na sejme zato da svoje stvari(sadike) prodajo ne pa da rastline razstavijo, o njih svetujejo in priporo\u010dajo. Vse manj je mo\u017enosti da bi se obiskovalci nau\u010dili o novih ali redkih rastlinah, jih spoznavali in jih morda tudi uvrstili in posadili v svoj vrt. Uspe\u0161ni sejmi(razstave) so isti kjer se med sabo prepletata oba vidika tako razstavni kot tudi prodajni. In zanimivo, kljub mno\u017eici vrtnarij, vrtnarskih obratov,ki se pojavljajo na razstavah se med sabo poznamo, sre\u010dujemo na sejmih in izmenjavamo podatke in informacije o rastlinah in zanimivih prireditvah.     Nekateri sejmi(razstave) so obvezni za vrtnarje, ki dajo kaj na sebe, na nekatere gre\u0161, da spozna\u0161 nove ljudi. Vsak od sejmov(razstav) ima svoje zahteve in obiskovalce. Na enem ob\u010dudujejo Begonije in Fuchsije, na drugem le teden kasneje, pa te rastline nih\u010de niti ne pogleda , pa \u010de bi nanjo nalepil \u0161e denar in bi ob tem igrala Golica. Sto ljudi sto \u010dudi je lep pregovor, ki dr\u017ei tudi na sejmih.     Seznam razstav\/sejmov, kjer bom sodeloval in razstavljal v letu 2016 je \u017ee skoraj narejen, ve\u010dina terminov je zasedenih,vabila na ostale razstave\/sejme ki jih dobivam pa vljudno zavra\u010dam. Kot sem \u017ee ve\u010dkrat povedal in zapisal :preve\u010d razstav\/sejmov in premalo sobot in nedelj v \u010dasu rastlinske vegetacije da bi se udele\u017eil vseh.     Prav tako so termini v aprilu in maju zasedeni, zato na sejmu v Ljubljani(bol\u0161ji sejem rastlin) ne bom prisoten.     Vrtni sejmi(razstave) vse bolj pridobivajo na veljavi. Obisk se pove\u010duje, pestrost ponujenih rastlin je velika da dru\u017eenja niti ne izpostavljam . Z tak\u0161nim dogodkom pravzaprav vsi pridobijo . Obiskovalci najdejo rastline ki so jih \u017ee dolgo iskali, prodajalci pridejo v osebni stik s kupci in kar je \u0161e pomembneje z drugimi vrtnarji .     V Sloveniji sta tak\u0161na sejma le dva(trije) kar je za majhno tr\u017ei\u0161\u010de dovolj. Spomladanski bol\u0161ji sejem rastliun v Botani\u010dnem vrtu Ljubljana ki je najstarej\u0161i in tudi najbolj obiskan ki ga organizirata SVZ in Botani\u010dni vrt tretjo soboto v maju(letos bo 11).     Jesenski sejem redkih rastlin v Celju v soorganizaciji SVZ in Vi\u0161je \u0161ole za hortikulturo Celje     Sejem rastlin v Botani\u010dnem vrtu Maribor v za\u010detku maja.     Izven na\u0161ih meja je sejmov veliko ve\u010d. Vabila, ki jih prejemam za udele\u017ebo na tak\u0161nih sejmih, se v nekaterih primerih pokrivajo, nekateri so majhni sejmi v vaseh ali manj\u0161ih mestih. Preve\u010d sejmov in premalo sobot in nedelj, da bi se udele\u017eil vseh.

      "text":" The primary objective of the Eurosystem, which part is also the Bank of Slovenia, is to maintain price stability. The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Independent taskforce of legal experts: Proposed legal solutions for unresolved issues following the bank recovery and resolution of 2013     05\/05\/2021 \/ Press release     Banka Slovenije has taken a more active role in seeking solutions to unresolved issues in connection with the recovery and resolution of the banking system in 2013, and the impact on those involved in that process from the decisions made at that time by the competent institutions. Given the unsuccessful attempts to find solutions to unresolved issues, judicial relief has still not been guaranteed for all participants in that process. The independent taskforce of legal experts set up at Banka Slovenije to draw up proposed solutions for unresolved issues has completed its work, and today presented a report of its key findings.     The taskforce consists of Prof Miha Juhart, Dr Miro Prek, Prof Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00fcm and Franc Testen. Their findings, which they presented to leaders of parliamentary groups earlier today, are cited below.     Banka Slovenije will study their findings, and will brief the competent institutions accordingly.     Taskforce\u2019s conclusions and proposed solutions     Objective liability on the part of Banka Slovenije is not the key to a solution of the issue of (potential) claims against commercial banks by former holders of qualified liabilities.     Changing the definition (qualification) of Banka Slovenije\u2019s liability for damages (from qualified culpability to objective liability and back again) is not a suitable solution that could satisfactorily resolve the issues of bank recovery and resolution.     a) Article 350a of the ZBan-1 is not a suitable basis for assessing the former holders\u2019 entitlement to the reimbursement of the loss suffered in the write-down. It is thus possible to clarify why the Constitutional Court interpreted the ZBan-1 such that it sets out objective liability for any losses incurred. Objective liability was then also enforced by the ZPSVIKOB. The described intervention by the Constitutional Court and the adoption of the ZPSVIKOB in essence mean that barely anything remains of the original content of Article 350a in connection with Article 223a of the ZBan-1. To put it more precisely: only the provision that Banka Slovenije is passively legitimate and liable for payment (even under modified conditions).     The provisions of the Banking Act (Article 350a of the ZBan-1) did not provide a suitable basis for resolving the claims of former holders of qualified liabilities. The Constitutional Court built upon them with its requirements for effective judicial relief, which were pursued by the legislator in the adoption of the ZPSVIKOB. Banka Slovenije's liability was modified from culpability to objective liability, where the tendency is for Banka Slovenije\u2019s liability to again be judged according to the criteria of culpability (following the decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union). For now, it is clear only that under all arrangements to date Banka Slovenije has been designated as responsible for paying compensation to the former holders, and will also be the defendant in judicial proceedings; it is extremely questionable whether Banka Slovenije can be ordered to pay compensation.     The introduction of a reimbursement scheme funded from the budget would be a consistent solution.     b) The enforcement of objective liability is in accordance with the concepts on which Directive 2014\/59\/EU is based (although adopted subsequently), although these arrangements would require the compensation for the aforementioned curtailment to not be borne by Banka Slovenije. This means that in regulations governing judicial relief for former holders on the basis of Article 350a, the state should be designated the passively legitimate party (at least until the establishment of any scheme for financing resolution). Otherwise it would be a case of impermissible monetary financing: Banka Slovenije would have to settle the state\u2019s liabilities.     For similar cases, the applicable arrangements in the EU (the BRRD) envisage resolution via funding from special resolution funds, which are built up through contributions by banks. Bank resolution would first be the responsibility of the state, and then the responsibility of the banking community, but never the responsibility of the central bank. The central bank\u2019s obligation to provide funding for bank resolution breaches the prohibition of monetary financing, and at the same time encroaches on the independence of the central bank.     c) With regard to the existing legal arrangements (passive legitimacy of Banka Slovenije), a solution is offered by legislating for a claim of recourse by Banka Slovenije against the state on the basis of exculpation through proof of the absence of culpability. Or a solution that is even more in keeping with the nature of the legal relationship: a government scheme for financing resolution (potentially with a claim of recourse, under the principle of culpability on the part of Banka Slovenije).     Should Banka Slovenije be required to pay compensation, it could demand reimbursement from the state if it proves that it was not culpable. A more direct solution would be the establishment of a reimbursement scheme.     d) According to the described arrangements for Banka Slovenije\u2019s objective liability, the possibility that former holders only formulate declaratory claims on the merits, and the general arrangements under the ZPP, the courts will be able to order the submission of all necessary documents and the disclosure of all necessary information, which Banka Slovenije will be required to submit and to disclose. The submitted documents and disclosed information will be properly protected, and provisions on virtual data rooms are not essential for the exercise of the former holders\u2019 rights.     The arrangements already in force allow the former holders\u2019 claims to be pursued even without special additional arrangements with regard to access to documents and disclosure of information. Banka Slovenije has already granted access to all information required by the attorney of a former holder to lodge a lawsuit.     The reimbursement scheme seems to be the only solution that is sufficiently acceptable in legal terms, transparent, consistent and effective.     e) The establishment of a reimbursement scheme to reimburse the curtailment, having regard for the precepts formulated in legislation in certain similar cases of curtailment, where it was not feasible or reasonable to substantiate a system of liability for damages, seems to be a suitable option for resolving issues in the pursuit of claims by former holders.     All finally awarded amounts of all former holders and all amounts to which former holders are found to be entitled by competent authorities in prescribed proceedings (this refers to arbitration, settlement and other forms of dispute resolution that might occur: this is contingent on the appropriate amendment of the legislation) would be settled from the reimbursement scheme.     f) Restricting the burdens of the implementation of the ZPSVIKOB to the functioning of Banka Slovenije can be achieved by spinning off the resolution of disputes to a specialist department or by transferring these tasks by law to another (or new) public sector entity, which can be a solution that helps Banka Slovenije to participate more effectively in judicial disputes of this type.     g) Process mechanisms: Stipulation of the exclusive territorial and material jurisdiction of a single court, mandatory consolidation of actions, encouragement of actions lodged via a joint representative, indispensable co-litigation, special provisions on lists of parties, etc. do not satisfactorily resolve the legal and practical problems faced by the court and in particular by the defendant as a result of the sheer number of plaintiffs expected. This problem (in the phase of proceedings after declaratory claims) can be partly alleviated by the amendment of the provision on co-litigation, such that genuine indispensable co-litigation is legislated for former holders of the same class at a particular commercial bank. The taskforce also assessed the feasibility and suitability of other solutions to this problem: representative test proceedings, the collective action, and the transfer of process legitimacy.     None of the solutions under the ZPSVIKOB that the legislator believed could meet the objective set by the Constitutional Court (effective judicial relief) is of itself capable of meeting the objective: a large number of lengthy, complex judicial proceedings would be necessary. Representative test proceedings have previously been legislated, as have proceedings with collective actions; some of the potential solutions (e.g. the transfer of process legitimacy, which entails the mandatory representation of all former holders in a specific class by a single statutory representative) are extremely constitutionally questionable. Significant gains might only come in the second part of the proceedings, when and if they happen (the courts could find in the first part of the proceedings that the former holders\u2019 claims are substantiated, and would determine the amount of compensation in the second part).     h) Representative test proceedings: There is an argument that the existing ZPSVIKOB allows for representative test proceedings to be conducted, under the mutatis mutandis application of the ZPP. If the provision on mandatory consolidation of actions is shown to prevent this, it would only require a minor revision to the ZPSVIKOB. However, representative test proceedings would significantly reduce the burden on the court solely in the event of them ending with a finding fully in favour of the claim. Otherwise the proceedings that would continue in suspended cases would face the same problems caused by the sheer number of disputes.     i) Collective action: Compensatory redress for qualified creditors could be pursued as a collective action, but it is highly uncertain what reduction in the number of proceedings would actually be brought by this solution. A solution of this type would in any case require an amendment of the law (the ZKolT, or even better, the ZPSVIKOB), which is not constitutionally questionable, as the collective action does not replace individual judicial relief, but merely augments the possibilities, provided that the opt-in principle is applied. Here the main issue seems to be the creation of a representative organisation for creditors. This approach to lodging compensatory redress might be appealing to creditors, if mechanisms for positively motivating creditors to join such an approach to pursuing redress were to be set out.     j) Transfer of process legitimacy: This is an almost perfect solution, but not only is it demanding in legislative terms, it is also constitutionally extremely questionable. It is a matter of the exclusive transfer of the right of access to a tribunal, which denies plaintiffs their right to judicial relief, and would find it hard to withstand a constitutional assessment under the strictest test of proportionality. The essential attributes of the transfer of process legitimacy and the necessary constitutional caveats addressed by the European Court of Human Rights in the Lithgow case are perhaps of interest, as they touch on certain issues that might be relevant in any decision to apply the institution of collective action under the opt-in principle to the disputed case of the former holders.     k) The taskforce draws attention to the possibility of reducing the problem of the sheer number of disputes in the scheduling phase. The solution of having the matter decided on by administrative units in administrative proceedings is worthy of consideration. This would ensure decentralisation and sharing of the burden of the large number of claims. The bases for scheduling are simple and standardised, while standardisation of the practices of administrative units could be ensured by the use of software to calculate compensation schedules.     About the reimbursement scheme:     All cases of already-functioning reimbursement schemes (trial without undue delay, the erased in part, the wrongfully convicted) involve objective liability for certain consequences of acts issued by the authorities. In all cases it is also stipulated by law that compensation payments should be borne by the state from the state budget, either from a special fund on behalf of and for the account of the state, or from an item in the financial plan of the designated authority.     The ZPSVIKOB also defines Banka Slovenije\u2019s objective liability for the curtailment suffered by the former holders. As soon as unlawfulness is established in the narrower sense, i.e. irrespective of culpability, Banka Slovenije must reimburse the former holders for the actual curtailment of their assets, namely the value that would have remained had the extraordinary measure not been imposed (i.e. if the bank had not received state aid and would potentially not have fallen into bankruptcy, or, in the event of bankruptcy, the former holders would have been repaid (at least in part)).     The reimbursement scheme is a solution that the taskforce believes would provide an effective answer to the prohibition of monetary financing. In previous discussions this option was not elaborated in detail.     One of the potential solutions would be for the funding for the reimbursement scheme to be provided by the BAMC, the state and Banka Slovenije in accordance with the rules that were just about to be aligned in various processes.     There are several different options with regard to the approach to the creation and operation of the reimbursement scheme:     1. first proposed solution: restriction of the burdens of the implementation of the ZPSVIKOB to the functioning of Banka Slovenije:     a) Spin-off within the framework of Banka Slovenije (ensuring the organisational and functional independence of a department to deal exclusively with issues in connection with the former holders\u2019 proceedings).     b) Tasks in connection with bank recovery and resolution now performed by Banka Slovenije are transferred by law to any of the already functioning institutions. Issues with regard to this transfer are regulated by law.     c) A new public sector entity is established by law with the exclusive task of making repayments for which it is determined in judicial proceedings and amicable resolution proceedings that such repayments should be made, to whom and in what amount.     2. second proposed solution: create a system for the amicable resolution of claims, and submit it to stakeholders for discussion and confirmation in principle (having regard for the two major groups of creditors, namely large investors and retail investors, and the two categories of claimants, namely holders of bonds and similar rights, and shareholders), then adopt it in the form of a law or other legal rules.

Those born before that remember to this day the pioneers\u2019 oath and the ideals that it carried. History, though, went another way. In the story, set in a small town in the timespan of three decades, the moral emptiness of today\u2019s consumerist world is faced with the ideologised past and poses the question whether the past was necessary and is the future really open. Where are the dinar and the para? Where are La\u010dni Franz, Blondie, Abba, AC\/DC, Haustor? What is 2013? What are we fighting for in 2013? What are we striving for? What are we building? What do we believe in? What do we value? What are we sharing? Which world is better? The one we live it, the one we lived in or the one that\u2019s coming? Simona Semeni\u010d\u2019s play was nominated for the Grum Award at last year\u2019s Week of Slovenian Drama. \"The gap that opened between the spirit of our time, marked by calculations, materialism and corporative logic, and the past spirit of the approximate of the socialist society, is accentuated in directing by (re) mixing, cuts, and transitions \u2013 more glimpses than developed situations, more sketches than finished images. And because of this approach, we\u2019ll remember this performance.\" (Nenad Jelesijevi\u0107, rtvslo.si)     Photo gallery     Our site uses cookies for social networks connections, better overall site performance and awesome user experience.

Ticket holders are entitled to a refund (please send your requests to [email protected]).     S\u00edlvia P\u00e9rez Cruz developed her interest in the arts not only at music school, but also at the art school of her mother, Alartis (Espai de creaci\u00f3), a place full of space, resources and freedom, where various artistic disciplines coexisted. S\u00edlvia recalls, for example, that in her mother\u2019s classes, the children had to paint with chocolate what she played on the saxophone, and she also remembers her mother playing the guitar while she taught drawing. This makes it easier to understand that while her natural language and passion is music, S\u00edlvia is deeply interested in art and has always encouraged encounters with other artists, in order to go further and to understand how each artistic language expresses the same reality.     This project presents songs that S\u00edlvia has composed in collaboration with other artists and artistic disciplines: theatre, cinema, dance, painting, photography, poetry. Recent examples (all from 2018) can be found in the film La noche de 12 a\u00f1os (English: A Twelve-Year Night), the original music created for the work Grito Pelao with the dancer Roc\u00edo Molina, and her compositions for the play Cyrano, featuring Llu\u00eds Homar.     In keeping with this interdisciplinary dialogue and in order to bring a sense of unity to the project, a link to photography was forged in the form of a series of photos, each of which will be used as a specific cover image for one of the songs. S\u00edlvia also lent her face to the service of artistic makeup: for each one of these covers, her face is treated as a canvas, and the result is directly inspired by the music in each case.     In cooperation with 36th International Druga godba Festival "

Bilo je v najob\u010dutljivej\u0161em \u010dasu korona krize.     Po 5. tednih so mi odstranili mavec, desna roka pa je bila negibljiva, ote\u010dena, bole\u010da in popolnoma neuporabna. Nikjer niso naro\u010dali na fizioterapijo. Za obupat.     Nato pa mi je sin priporo\u010dil podjetje FIZAKTIV, ki izvaja fizioterapijo in vadbo na domu. Moram omeniti izredno prijaznost, strokovnost, prilagajanje \u2026 Prijazni terapevti so mi manualno razgibali roko in mi povrnili funkcionalnost roke \u2013 8 sre\u010danj po 45 minut. Po vsaki vadbi je bil viden o\u010diten napredek. Roka je postajala vedno bolj gibljiva, manj je bilo bole\u010din, oteklina je izginjala.     Seveda se trudim tudi sama, delam nau\u010dene vaje in roka je spet uporabna. Toplo priporo\u010dam vadbo, ki jo izvaja podjetje FIZAKTIV.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

      "text":" EYE-LCD-4700-24NB     Z novimi LCD monitorji tipa EYE-LCD-4700-24NB eyevis nudi revolucionarno tehnologijo za monitorje na osnovi TFT-LCD. Zasloni z diagonalo 47\" nudijo najbolj\u0161o kvaliteto slik, visoko lo\u010dljivost, ozke okvirje in edinstveno delovanje pri celodnevni uporabi (pri upo\u0161tevanju zahtevanih pogojev delovanja).     Thanks to the narrow bezel the displays are a first choice for modular video wall applications. The gap between the image contents of adjacent screens measures only 30 mm. eyevis implemented numerous optimised features to prevent so called \"Image Sticking\" effects which are likely to occur on other LCD monitors, especially when static content is displayed over prolonged time. Of course, the displays share the ultra-thin and slim design typical for TFT-LCD displays. This allows their flexible installation in almost every area of application. Whether you want to display video signals or computer signals, any kind of data can be displayed on the EYE-LCD4700-24NB. In combination with the eyevis netpix controller and the eyecon software a medium for representation and information can be created that perfectly fits smaller control rooms in which the spacefactor is a main criteria. In addition to that, you will attract more attention than before with your presentations, since these displays are the ideal medium to transport your company's message. eyevis provides all necessary accessories for wall and ceiling installations. Moreover, we offer a range of customised solutions (supporting stands, mobile stands, etc.). Special casings are also available (protection against vandalism, environmental influences, etc.).     Display Properties     ) Detail Expansion Optimised display of very small details. Particularly in dark areas, even smallest details - not visible on conventional displays - can be displayed generating an extremely brilliant and high-contrast image. ) Optimised Cooling Concept The intelligent cooling system has an open loop and a closed loop, making it very energy efficient, maintenance-free and reduces the cost of ownership. Furthermore, a special sealing method avoids dust accumulation inside the display. ) Dynamic Contrast Control Innovative technique for incessant correction of the backlight brightness and contrast of the TFT cells, resulting in a natural, very high-contrast image and reduced power consumption. ) Intelligent Noise Reduction Intelligent algorithms suppress the \u201enoise\u201c typical for analog signals, while optimising image performance. ) Dynamic Pixel Refreshing A special system driving the TFT cells avoids image sticking and increases display lifetime considerably. ) Pixel Shifting Continuous shifting of the entire image in different directions prevents image sticking. At normal viewing distance, this is almost not visible. If required by the application, the shifting area can be adjusted manually. ) Soft Picture Mode An intelligent scaling mechanism smoothes out extreme contrast transitions. This process avoids the so called boundary line image sticking, which occurs at \u201esharp\u201c transitions (e.g. black to white). If required, the degree of \u201esoftening\u201c can be adjusted manually. ) Temperature Control System Active temperature control, monitors the heat level and controls the fans. ) True Movie Mode Special method for the high-quality display of video signals, e.g. DVDs up to HD in 1080i (e.g. Blue-Ray).

      "text":" Intel starts preaching about security EE Times Print By Craig Matsumoto (01\/21\/99, 3:27 p.m. EDT)     SAN JOSE, Calif. Convinced that encryption and network security will be required to realize the dream of connecting PCs worldwide, Intel Corp. will begin incorporating security features into its hardware. The company's first steps, outlined at the RSA'99 conference of RSA Data Security Inc., will be a unique ID number for every Pentium III microprocessor that Intel ships, and the ability to generate purely random numbers in hardware.     Much as the company encouraged the development of sophisticated graphics applications on the PC, it plans to prod the industry to develop ubiquitous security across a PC-based network. That's a relatively recent push within Intel, driven by the realization that its vision of connecting PCs worldwide could never work without ways to secure those networks, said Patrick Gelsinger, vice president of Intel (Santa Clara, Calif.).     Intel will discuss its encryption plans with the press in a briefing today (Jan. 21), but an Intel spokesman contended that the company hasn't fleshed out its specific plan for wielding the RSA technology. \"Certainly nothing's solidified,\" he said.     \"Intel is covering its bases,\" said Albert Pang, electronic commerce analyst with International Data Corp. (Mountain View, Calif.). \"They realize this is something they can't overlook.\" Banks, for example, are \"one of the major spenders\" in technology, and they could scale back their networking plans if they aren't satisfied with advances in security, he said.     Intel joins the fray armed with a cross-licensing agreement with encryption specialist RSA Data Security (San Mateo, Calif.). RSA's announcement of the agreement with Intel earlier this week led to speculation that Intel would build its own encryption chip or add encryption functions to the PC core logic, but both perceptions were \"just wrong,\" the Intel spokesman said.     On the surface, it appears that Intel would prefer to help define the road map for existing encryption companies rather than consume their markets. Some vendors had been pre-briefed about Intel's security plans and were confident that Intel's interest would help drive the growing market for PC and network security.     \"It's not out of compassion\" that Intel shares this information, said Shawn Abbott, chief technical officer for Rainbow Technologies Inc. (Irvine, Calif.), a vendor of encryption hardware and hardware-based security. Rather, Intel realizes it can't do all the legwork itself and instead turns to established industry players to become allies, he said. But he conceded that Intel's presence looms large: \"Without disclosure six months ago, this would have been a very     \"Just like every software company's looking over their shoulder at Microsoft, every silicon company's looking at Intel,\" said Bob Monsour, vice president of marketing for encryption-chip vendor Hi\/fn Inc. (Los Gatos, Calif.).     Still, he didn't see Intel as an immediate threat, partly because Intel can't yet replace networking security everywhere. Even if Intel were to handle all encryption inside the PC, corporations would need other vendors to secure the surrounding network. \"We're still at least five years off from having security be truly transparent, end-to-end, from my PC and my LAN to your PC and your LAN,\" Monsour said.     Pang, for one, agreed that Intel was unlikely to muscle in on the security business, which increasingly consists of middleware and client-server software applications more than raw encryption. \"Fundamentally, Intel is a chip vendor, so they're not going to go after the security business,\" Pang said. \"They just want these chips to be as fully featured as possible. Security is one of these areas people have been talking about for a long time.\"     Also not threatened by Intel's moves so far is the Microsoft Corp. initiative, also outlined at RSA, to add security features to Windows 2000. \"We work with Microsoft as we work with everybody,\" the Intel spokesman said. Intel's hardware enhancements will support Microsoft's Crypto API as well as RSA's security framework and Intel's own Common Data Security Architecture effort, Gelsinger said.     Intel's plan, outlined by Gelsinger in a keynote speech yesterday (Jan. 20), is to add security functions \u2014 not necessarily encryption \u2014 to every part of the PC, including the CPU, core logic and motherboard.     That doesn't necessarily mean Intel's chips will handle all encryption and security themselves, the Intel spokesman said. Such a move wouldn't be practical anyway, he said, because varying international encryption controls would prevent such chips from being shipped worldwide. Intel has not yet made any changes to BIOS to add security features there, he said.     Intel will be adding features to the hardware that security applications can exploit, and not all of the features will directly involve cryptography. \"The idea is that the cumulative total of these features increases the security of the system,\" he said.     For starters, Intel will burn a unique, secret identification number into every Pentium III that will ship. (While Gelsinger used the term \"serial number,\" Abbott pointed out that the numbers can't be literally serial, or they wouldn't be secret.) Applications for the number could range from authenticating the PC and user during network communications to registering individual machines for software. \"We have some 30-plus applications that have committed to take advantage of this,\" Gelsinger said.     Because the ID number also could be a privacy threat, Intel plans to allow end users to block transmission of the number, reportedly through a software patch.     For companies that sell into corporate networking environments, the ID number is a long-awaited relief.     \"We had dreamed of having a 'serial number' on the motherboard,\" Abbott said. Previous efforts to tack some kind of unique identification to a PC, through hardware or even through the operating system, had come up empty \u2014 \"Intel is the only one that could make this happen,\" Abbott said.     Additionally, Intel plans to provide a hardware-based random-number generator in every PC. The flaw in computer-generated pseudorandom numbers is that they fall in deterministic sequence; each \"random\" number is calculated based on its predecessor, making cycles and subtle patterns inevitable. Truly random numbers can only be gathered through physical phenomena, such as radioactive decay or, in Intel's case, thermal noise.     Chances are, the hardware random-number generator will be used to select a \"seed,\" or starting point, for an application's pseudorandom generator. This is because pseudorandom numbers are good enough in many cases; the problem is simply that an obvious seed is chosen, usually based on the date.     Intel's move could boost the security industry by reducing the additional cost for security, Abbott noted. He recalled Rainbow's short experiment with smart-card-based security: the company showed a prototype system to banks only to be rejected due to the cost of the card reader banks wouldn't even adopt the system if the cards came free, he noted.     Intel officials declined to explain any future security enhancements being planned. It's possible they would take the form of extension-set instructions, in the same way that MMX was installed as a multimedia aid. \"I've heard people say they might do something similar with RSA,\" Monsour said.     Intel: We won't track ID chips PC chip giant says it's walking on glass over the privacy considerations of new processor ID scheme. By Robert Lemos, ZDNN January 21, 1999 5:49 PM PT     Calif. -- Addressing privacy concerns, Intel Corp. stated Thursday it was being extremely careful in implementing its new processor ID number scheme.     The plan was announced Wednesday at the RSA Data Security conference in San Jose, Theand more details were given in a technology briefing here on Thursday. As part of its new initiative to create a connected world of trusted PCs, Intel has incorporated a number security initiatives, including a number generator and marking electronically every processor with a unique serial number. \"Our customers, application vendors and OEMs have been asking for [these serial numbers] for years,\" said Pat Gelsinger, vice president and general manager of Intel's desktop platform division.     Yet, as reported by ZDNN early Wednesday, privacy advocates voiced reservations about the new technology.     \"The application is a double-edged sword,\" said Barry Steinhardt, associate director and privacy expert at the American Civil Liberties Union in an interview. \"On the one hand, it offers more security -- for e-commerce and information security. As a pure privacy issue, it allows for tracking individuals on the Net.\"     Gelsinger addressed privacy concerns in Thursday's briefing.     The Intel exec said the PC chip giant was walking on glass when it came to privacy considerations with its new processor ID scheme. \"We won't keep a database of [the numbers] and we won't track them,\" he said. \"We are not keeping those processor numbers in any form at all.\"     Gelsinger added that the new initiative would not be used to combat illegal overclocking and chip theft -- two possible uses for the technology. Instead, applications vendors and Web sites can use the numbers to link a PC with a user's identity, thereby doubly ensuring the customer is who they say.     Intel also talked about its random number generator -- another security feature, which will be included in the chips for future PCs starting with Intel's next generation Pentium III. The generator will use thermal noise -- random signals affecting all silicon components -- to create truly random numbers.     \"We will not use this to create new security technology,\" said Gelsinger, \"but to make today's software more secure.\"     Random numbers are necessary for strong encryption -- a way of securing data from viewing by unintended audiences. The new feature will be included somewhere on the motherboard, said Gelsinger, not necessarily in the actual processor.     Another security feature slated for the next generation of Intel architecture is the Internet security protocol IPSec, which will be highlighted at the Intel Developers Forum in late February.     The PC chip giant also discussed its bi-annual efforts to shrink its processors. The next-generation of technology is known as 0.18-micron manufacturing. The new process will shrink processors to half the size they would require using today's 0.25-micron technology, and should be used to create processors due out later this year.     Intel plans to first use the technology to make processors for notebook computers. "

Cenik SIST     This Technical Report gives guidelines for estimating, assessing and documenting the daily vibration exposure due to the use of hand-held power tools and hand-guided machines, according to the requirements of the European Physical Agents Directive (vibration) 2002\/44\/EC. This Technical Report is addressed to competent services for the assessment of vibration exposure at the workplace and to national authorities and industrial organisations. It helps to establish documentation for specific machinery or work situations and can also be useful for employers. It follows the method of EN ISO 5349-1 and EN ISO 5349-2 but instead of measuring the vibration magnitudes at the specific workplaces, the methods in this Technical Report use existing vibration values from other sources of information including those provided by the manufacturers of the machinery according to the requirements of the Machinery Directive 2006\/42\/EC. It is important that the vibration values used in the exposure assessment are representative of those in the specific use of the machinery. Workplace measurements, however, are required if suitable data are not available to represent the vibration under the specific working conditions or if the calculation results do not help to decide whether or not the vibration exposure limit value or exposure action value is likely to be exceeded. This Technical Report gives guidance on how to estimate the exposure duration and the daily vibration exposure A(8) as defined in EN ISO 5349-1. It also offers a simple method for estimating the daily vibration exposure by means of a table which indicates the vibration exposure as a function of the equivalent vibration total value and the associated exposure duration. Both methods can be used even in cases of multiple exposures on the same day. Annex A gives guidance for manufacturers and suppliers of machinery concerning information that warns of risks from vibration, which should be reported to the customer.

Sezona metalskih koncertov v kranjskem Trainstation SubArt-u se 4. februarja nadaljuje z nastopi hard & heavy zasedbe Kariot iz Ljubljane, heavy metalci Edge Of Sins iz Cerknega in mladimi thrasherji Moshead iz \u0160kofje Loke.     Kariot je pet\u010dlanska zasedba izku\u0161enih glasbenikov, ki jih poznamo po sodelovanju s skupinami, kot so Classified, ShadowIcon, Tomcat, Snowblind in mnoge druge. Gre za skupino, ki definitivno seva \u017ear in zalet, ter neusmiljeno napada z izdatno mero hard rock in heavy metal rifov s primesmi progresive. Vzporednice njihovega stila pa bi lahko potegnili z nekaterimi izvajalci, kot so recimo Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Whitesnake, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Crimson Glory in podobni. Besedila govorijo o politiki, vojni in so dru\u017ebeno kriti\u010dna. Kariot so lansko leto posneli prvi single z naslovom \u00bbSchizo\u00ab, nestrpno pa pri\u010dakujemo tudi njihov studijski prvenec.     Edge Of Sins (na fotki) je slovenska metal zasedba, ki sta jo leta 2012 ustanovila kitarista Bla\u017e Hadalin in Jure Flander, medtem ko se je trenutna zasedba ustalila \u0161ele lani. Skupina s svojo avtorsko glasbo hodi po robu zapovedi sodobne dru\u017ebe in tako izziva \u0161tevilna splo\u0161na pojmovanja o obstoju in \u017eivljenju samem, kar bi bilo dandanes zlahka razumljeno kot gre\u0161no. Njihov prvi album \u00bbMy Escape\u00ab velja za konceptnega, saj zasedba poslu\u0161alca skozi 10 pesmi popelje skozi svet, v katerem se iskrenost, ljubezen in prijateljstvo podredijo zavisti, la\u017eem ter hitenju. V temu svetu pa se posku\u0161a znajti du\u0161a, ki \u0161e vedno verjame v harmonijo, glavno vpra\u0161anje pa je, ali bo tej du\u0161i uspelo upanje ponesti \u0161e med druge.     Moshead je thrash metal zasedba iz \u0160kofje Loke, katere korenine segajo \u0161e v njihova otro\u0161ka leta. Skupina je nastala leta 2011 in si od takrat naprej utira pot v svetu te\u017eke glasbe. Po nekaj odigranih koncertih po Sloveniji so bili povabljeni v oddajo V svojem ritmu na RTV Slovenija, kjer so si za nagrado izborili videospot. Prvotnega kitarista Matev\u017ea Vr\u0161i\u010da je lani zamenjal Tilen Jan, ki je prinesel veliko sve\u017eino ter novih rifov, nadaljna pot skupine pa se giblje v smeri njihovega prvega studijskega albuma.     Tegla pravi: ''Tokrat ni gostov.'' Zato pa imamo cel kup novitet: doma\u010da gruda je izbruhnila zanimivo zasedbo Goragorja, ki se predstavlja s prvencem. Prav tako doma\u010di thrasherji Panikk ponujajo okus nove plate, nov material pa imajo tudi Underground.     Iz tujine najprej cel kup blasfemije: filipinsko-kanadski Kratornas z novo plato, angle\u0161ki Hellripper ter brazilski Goat Worship ponujajo dozo peklenskega thrasha, blekk barve pa imajo Impaled Upon The Mountain. Klasi\u010dno nasilni thrash ponujajo kanadski Terrifier, klasi\u010dni power metal pa legendarni Grki Firewind.     Deathmetalski stari prdci so Six Feet Under ter Memoriam z novima singloma, deathcoru pa bodo \u0161amar stisnili avstralski Thy Art Is Murder. Ne pozabimo pa niti novih Sinister.

Nova plata bo letos.     Komentar benda: ''We're thrilled to announce that we've tightened the knot with Napalm Records for the release of our new album! We're looking forward to this exciting alliance for what will undoubtedly be the most important record in the SAMAEL history! We've been around long enough to appreciate the importance of collaboration when it comes to turn projects into reality. We still have many great things to achieve and our partnership with Napalm Records will most certainly help us in doing so.     2017 is the year! With a dynamic and enthusiastic team behind us and with the help of our dedicated fans we're more than ready to unleashed new music upon the world... More to follow soon!\"     Tokrat za single Era, ki vra\u010da Opeth v bolj bru\u0107al vode. Razlog ve\u010d, da si jih ogledate letos na festivalu Metaldays julija v Tolminu - so namre\u010d potrjeni headlinerji.     Kaj pravi vokalist Akerfeldt o spotu?     \"I have to say our involvement in the making of the 'Era' video was so minimal we can't take credit either for or against its brilliance. We did 3D scans of our bodies (clothed) in Munich during the last European tour. I remember everyone was extremely tired and probably slightly hungover. The director just placed us in a ice-cold room and then scanned us with something that looked like a flashing hairdryer. Done! We've done our part for the video. Next!     During the process of finishing the piece, it got clear to me that it really works with the song. That's something I was involved in actually, picking the song. It's extremely difficult. Which song to choose? How do I know what works best for this format? Well, I don't. I picked a song from the record that has a strong chorus. Slightly old-school way of thinking, I guess, but ultimately it didn't matter all that much to me.     The video is nice. I dig it. It's slightly on the pretentious side, but hey, works for me! And like I said, it really works with the overall vibe of the song. Lyrically and musically and definitely emotionally.\"     O novi dozi kultnega grinda pravi PR-sporo\u010dilo slede\u010de:     Demonization\" has been long in the making for a variety of reasons. Logistically, the band is based in different corners of the globe. Life invades at any given moment, disrupting the thought process as it does for anyone. At the same time, the realities\/brutalities of life have also inspired the band's creative process in many ways. Lyrically, this record deals with the rise and the fall and the rise again of the human consciousness: The struggle to resist the powers that be, the addiction of escape, the turmoil of reality, and how to survive the carnage and come out stronger....the reborn phoenix!     Musically, Reisenegger's riffs scream out in every mutated direction \u2014 fast, heavy and darkly colorful manifesting a true homage to the underground from which the band members all originate while simultaneously setting new standards in extremity. Barker's drumming surpasses lightning speeds of precision. The chaos is joyfully indefinable as he charges through the compositions like a bull to the red flag of hate. Embury's bass tones once again invoke rapid, low-end bestial movements to carry the lost souls across The River Styx! And Sharp, what needs to be said? Nearly thirty years of guttural exorcisms that continue to inspire the world underdogs. It just doesn't get any better that this.     Na omenjeni plo\u0161\u010di se kot vokalist prvi\u010d predstavlja Kevin Sharp, ki je nasledil Tompo Lindberga, ki je leta 2014 izstopil iz benda, da bi se posvetil zasedbi At The Gates. Spodaj imate udarni\u0161ki komad! Seka!     First Blood po dobrih 14 dneh ponujajo \u0161e eno skladbo s prihajajo\u010dega albuma Rules. These Are The Rules, kot je skladba naslovljena je pevec Carl Schwartz (ex-Terror) komentiral v slede\u010dih besedah:     \"This song serves as a 'preamble' for the concept of this album. Rules. Who sets the rules? What rules? Why should we care? Well, these are the rules that control nearly every aspect of our lives. We serve. We sacrifice. We corrupt. We pollute. We hate. We torture. We oppress. And we kill. But it's okay, because positions of power say it's okay. Public opinion (or lack thereof) says it's okay. Laws of the state say it's okay. Accept these terms and everything will be okay. Dare to question them and you will pay. These are the rules... This is reality. Some things we might never change, but at the very least I say, \"Don't stop fighting for what you believe if you're to rise up from this hate.\"     Album Rules bo na voljo 10. februarja preko zalo\u017ebe Pure Noise.     Video of FIRST BLOOD \"THESE ARE THE RULES\"     21. 1. 2017 Soen letos v Ljubljani - tukaj je tudi novi single     Vesela Dihur\u010dka sporo\u010data:     V sklopu Orto Festa bomo tokrat lahko uzrli dve sili progresivne glasbe - Soen in Madder Mortem.     Soen je zasedba, ki je mogo\u010de najbolj znana po tem, da v njej igra Martin Lopez, nekdanji bobnar progresivcev Opeth. Soen ne obstajajo prav dolgo \u010dasa, je pa njihova glasba dale\u010d od dolg\u010dasa, \u010de ne celo brez\u010dasna. Mogo\u010dna progresivna nota se kali v glasbenem univerzumu, ki so ga ustvarili Tool, katere Soen jemljejo za o\u010diten vzor, kar tudi priznavajo in promovirajo. Prvenec zasedbe Soen, Cognitive, je prinesel nov veter v \u017eanr progresivne glasbe, naslednik Tellurian pa dokazal, da gre za zasedbo, katero ni mo\u010d jemati samoumevno, saj vztrajno presene\u010da. Pa tudi v \u017eivo izpadejo odli\u010dno. Letos napovedujejo album Lykaia.     Madder Mortem pa so norve\u0161ki progresivci, katerih temne barve so se za\u010dele kaliti najprej v atmosferi\u010dni doom glasbi in to \u017ee davnega leta 1997. Zasedba iz Osla je z leti postala ime, ki ga postavljajo ob bok underground progresivcem, kot so kultni Arcturus, portugalski Ava Inferi, angle\u0161ki To-Mera, \u0161vedski The Provenance ter tudi norve\u0161ki In The Woods ... Raziskujejo mra\u010dne teme ter tako glasbeno kot vsebinsko ve\u010d kot odli\u010dno sodijo k zalo\u017ebi Dark Essence Records.     April bo torej ve\u010d kot dovolj privla\u010den - tako za u\u0161esa, kot za um. Vstopnice so \u017ee na voljo.     Soen pa premierno predstavljajo tudi video za single Lucidity, bobnar Lopez pa pravi: \"This song represents a time in my life when I unconsciously walked towards self-destruction and celebrates, to an extent, the death of that lifestyle and the birth of a new era. It's dark but comforting. The music is soft and dreamy but carries the tension of a past-life full of mistakes.\"     21. 1. 2017 Govoric je konec - Thy Art Is Murder uradno ponovno s pevcem C. J. McMahonom     Avstralska deathcore be\u0161tija Thy Art Is Murder je ponovno utrjena, saj se je k mikrofonu vrnil bestialni vokalist C. J. McMahon. \u010ceprav je o tem pisal \u017ee Matev\u017e nekaj dni nazaj, ko \u0161e ni bilo gotovo, ali se je pevec res vrnil v bend ali pa se jim je le pridru\u017eil za nastop na nekem avstralskem festivalu, je sedaj jasno, da je mo\u017eakar nazaj, o tem, kako je pri\u0161lo do tega, pa je tu izjava kitarista Andya Marsha:     \"A little over a year ago, we were left in a pickle when C.J. had finally reached his breaking point \u2014 the physical, emotional and mental stresses of touring, and the lifestyle had taken its toll on him. After the dust had settled, we had time to speak amongst ourselves, and with him, and we were all able to get on the same page. He was able to take time off from the road and work consistently, tick off some life goals like getting married, and enjoy the routine and familiarity of life at home with his friends and family. Conversely, the rest of us kept going, touring relentlessly, playing bigger tours to more people than ever before, going to new countries for the very first time, and had a blast taking a few great vocalists and mates out for the ride with us while we weathered the storm and figured things out. Special thanks must go out to Monte Barnard, Nicholas Arthur, Lochlan Watt, and every other vocalist who took the time to apply in our discrete vocalist auditions.     After a few months away from the chaotic life on the road, C.J. reached out to us and we started maintaining more regular communication. He mentioned how he had started cleaning up, was focused on working hard and saving for his wedding and enjoying time at home, but he also mentioned he missed the shows, the friends, and us \u2014 his band. After months of working things out, gaining his voice back, and mending wounded friendships, we are overwhelmed with excitement to announce that we have completed writing for a new record to be released later this year, featuring the one and only Christopher John McMahon. Welcome back, C.J.!\"     Da bi proslavili omenjeno, je bend izdal single No Absolution:     'No Absolution' is a rich tapestry, intertwined in faith, scripture and doctrine, and a story about the process that we have endured throughout the last year. We recorded this during the session for 'Holy War' but quite simply ran out of time to finish writing lyrics and recording vocals for it in order to make the record. This song now stands alone, without a record or release \u2014 a gift from us to you, thank you for your continued support, we can't wait to show you what we're making for 2017.\"     Video of THY ART IS MURDER - No Absolution (OFFICIAL VIDEO)     Ameri\u0161ki thrash povratniki Warbringer se letos vra\u010dajo z novo plato, naslovljeno Woe To The Vanquished. Ta bo iz\u0161la zadnjega mar\u010devskega dne prek zalo\u017ebe Napalm Records.     Na njej se nahaja tudi single Silhouettes, za katerega so posneli tudi spot. Vokalist John Kevill pravi:     \"This song, the album opener, is a blazing and intense number; we wanted the album to open with pure annihilation. I had the lyric in my head and the frantic riff under the verse since the beginning of 2014, and I am very pleased that it exists as a full song now. The idea for the song came from a particularly chilling detail found at Hiroshima and Nagasaki; when the atomic bombs went off the shadows of people whose bodies were vaporized still remain burned onto the walls and the ground where they once stood. To me, this is goddamn horrifying. I thought, 'What if the souls of those dead remain trapped in the shadows?'     I wanted to have the song written from a future where civilization has failed, the Earth is in ruins and the few remaining survivors live a horrible existence. The untold millions of shadows from this future, burnt into stone, look back at us in the present time and judge us for bringing about the apocalypse that, though we saw it coming, we did nothing to avoid.     \"The way I see it, we continue funding weaponry that keeps getting more and more devastating (search 'satan-2' if you think this issue is some relic), and leadership seems on a sharp downward trend as well. Not the ingredients for a positive outcome. Remember, it only takes one mistake, once, and everything everyone has ever built, written, painted, all music, all culture, every ounce of human achievement is gone, in a single blinding flash. Like it or not, this is the world we live in today, and entering 2017 the delicate balance tips and sways more and more.\"     Warbringer se bodo skupaj s Havok, Gorod in Exmortus ustavili v ljubljanskem Orto Baru 20. aprila letos.     Video of WARBRINGER - Silhouettes (Official Video) | Napalm Records     Kako bi zvenelo, \u010de bi bend ustvarili vokalist Bret Hoffman (MALEVOLENT CREATION), basist Tony Choy (PESTILENCE), bobnar Mike Smith (SUFFOCATION) ter kitarist (in tokrat tudi idejni vodja) Gio Geraca (ASHES OF ARES)?     Naj bi sli\u0161ali \u017ee letos. Kako se bo bendu reklo, ni znano, je pa znano, da bo prvi single iz\u0161el marca, zvenel pa naj bi ekstremno, atmosferi\u010dno, a precej druga\u010de od tega, kar smo vajeni od omenjenih \u010dlanov.     21. 1. 2017 Prihaja nova plo\u0161\u010da tema\u010dnih Vallenfyre     Vallenfyre je zasedba, ki \u0161opa death metal in v kateri so mo\u010di zdru\u017eili \u010dlani zasedb Paradise Lost in My Dying Bride. Mo\u017eje so pa pravkar sporo\u010dili, da so posneli novo plo\u0161\u010do, v sodelovanju s Kurtom Baloujem v njegovem Godcity Studios.     Bend pravi: \"12 songs. No samples. No triggers. No bullshit. Instead you get crucifyingly loud amps, ferocious drumming, and vicious vocals spitting out hate and venom. Raw honest brutality. No conformity. No compromise. A murderous nightmare vomiting poisonous bile onto a twisted world. Yeah, that's the bits I like...\"     Smrdljiva poslastica izide poleti prek zalo\u017ebe Century Media, naslov plate pa je Fear Those Who Fear Him.     V petdesetih letih prej\u0161njega stoletja so se v Sovjetski zvezi pojavili nenavadni razpe\u010devalci, ki so glasbo prepovedanih izvajalcev ponujali kar na rentgenskih slikah.     Album Dreaming Neon Black bi zaradi srhljivega ozadja najbr\u017e zlahka uvrstili med najbolj presunljive plate v metalu.     2020 bo o\u010ditno leto temnega vala. Ponovno obujanje \u017eanra darkwave je v polnem zagonu, zanimivo pa je to, da pri nas \u0161e zmeraj primanjkuje tovrstnih glasbenih zasedb.     18 let organiziranja koncertov raznih oblik ekstremne glasbe ni ma\u010dji ka\u0161elj, tako da lahko na tem mestu Dirty Skunksom samo \u010destitamo.     Noctiferia so nastopili suvereno in brez pretenzije, ki spremlja mnogo sodobnega black metala. Na ta na\u010din so se takoj pribli\u017eali ob\u010dinstvu in intimno vzdu\u0161je Ostrige izkoristili sebi v prid.     Da je ve\u010dina obiskovalcev tokrat pri\u0161la zaradi Voivod, je bilo ve\u010d kot jasno in logi\u010dno, vseeno pa se marsikdo zdaj lahko pohvali, da je enkrat v \u017eivljenju dejansko videl Gwar na koncertu.

      "text":" Branko Cerovac: Ve\u0161 slikar svoj dolg     After decades of acquaintance with this name-concept: Painter Do You Know Your Duty (V.S.S.D.), and countless repeated contemplations of this puzzle (question \u2013 answer, no question \u2013 no answer), coming face-to-face with my own assignment\/promise\/debt (duty) to show (myself) my hand in that trans-philosophical, aesthetic game of the question \u2013 answer as a name, project, beginning, it suddenly flashed before my \u201cthird\u201d eye \u2013 like \u201cNewton\u2019s Single Vision,\u201d the vision of a William Blake \u2013 that the Painter (hidden under the arbitrary signature of an anonymous \u201cJordan O\u017ebolt\u201d) is in the vice of Kant\u2019s three Critiques. Almost explicitly. PAINTER (Painter: aesthetic moment, the \u201cpower of judgement\u201d as a link between the pure-theoretical and practical moments of Critique; which, naturally, is also true of Oton \u017dupan\u010di\u0107\u2019s Poet) \/ DO YOU KNOW (knowing, the cognitive moment, knowledge, theoretical mind, with its limits!) \/ YOUR DUTY (practical, ethical moment of \u201cdebt\u201d, duty, promises, obligations, acts, not only pictorial but also linguistic, spoken, in terms of a given word, an act of naming, Austin\u2019s speech acts, actions, performatives: moral activity, with full criminal responsibility, as in graffiti art \u201ccrimes\u201d (mostly done at night, according to first-hand witnesses) of the subcultural, underground and \u201calternative\u201d \u201cJordan O\u017ebolt\u201d gang (V.S.S.D., early period) from the stylistic epoch of late socialism with the human face\/mask in the mid-1980s.     Vandals are required (forced) to tell the \u201cTruth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth\u201d before the Power of Judgement. We are here on Artaud\u2019s, Bataille\u2019s and Foucault\u2019s ground of a \u201cmurdered suicide\u201d (Van Gogh). In the middle of a cruel arena of surveillance, punishment, madhouse and the Panopticon. The thousand eyes and thousand arms of Argos Panoptes eternally watch over this artistic duo (a trans-temporal dimension of multiple luminosity), rather than some historical collectivism. And this primal many-eyed monster of perception does not care at all about seeing politics as the highest form of art. That paleo-ontological monster.     Super-Painter\u2019s Argos Panoptes. He does not care about any national myths or private (personal) mythologies. This Painter is a Single Author in the sense of \u201cnatural\u201d, primordial, ontological, \u201capolitical\u201d gnostic Anthropos (Hen kai pan), Early Man, Pan Gu. The unity of Dionysian and Apollonian nature that early Nietzsche faced immediately before The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music. With a principled, explicit, declarative distancing (see A. O\u017ebolt\u2019s lectures) from any political determination\/classification; unless such a poetic \u201chabitus\u201d is intended to be forcefully interpreted as a kind of \u201cpolitical\u201d attitude. Which in no way agrees with the artistic oeuvre of Painter Do You Know Your Duty (1984\u20131995) or with O\u017ebolt\u2019s own artistic and theoretical work either as an interpretation of basic intention or methodology. For it is an eminently poetic, aesthetic, not political-ideological self-determination. In that way, the V.S.S.D. duo \u201cJordan O\u017ebolt\u201d, meant and said cum grano salis, is in many ways more akin to ontologically anarchist \u201ctrans-aesthetic\u201d ideas as formulated by Hakim Bey (Peter Lamborn Wilson) since the mid-1980s than, for example, to the discourse of collectivist organizations such as Neue Slovenische Kunst. These are essentially different paradigms.     \u201cAnd the last thing to say before showing the slides is that my friend and I started working together outside the gallery, not inside. We started as graffiti artists in the streets of Ljubljana in early 1984. Graffiti art is night art, of course. And because it was illegal and could also be dangerous to make graffiti works at that time in former Yugoslavia, it was safer to work in pairs: while one worked on the painting, the other one kept watch...\u201d2     Intro-\/Retro-\/speculation on\/with V.S.S.D.     In the beginning and without end     Where are they, when are they, do they even ek-sist (ek-sistere3, to be-outside-of-oneself), do we feel them inside or outside of ourselves, ecstatically, as in the form of an \u201cexhibition\u201d \u2212 like some Ausstellung, some e-motive \u2013 ex-movere! \u2013 shocking, intensely affective experience (temptation, maybe even the shivering kind in the sense of the temptation of St. Anthony the Hermit, no?), so, where and when are the beginning-end, the alpha-omega of the original time-space as \u201cforms of intuition\u201d, intuition of the succession of becoming\/passing and synchronicity of a Retrospective Exhibition, here and now.     I write from memory, anamnesis ... I allow pictures to emerge before my inner eye\/s ... I allow the affect to get a word in. So, I see a broken mirror, and I associate it with my thoughts written three decades ago: \u201cPainter Do You Know Your Duty \u2013 Museum\u201d (Rijeka magazine RiVal, 1989), with conversations (written and unwritten), along with the postcard with a reproduction of a landscape on which the Painter drew a tiny plane in pen onto the cloudy sky and mailed it to me (we didn\u2019t have PCs, the internet etc. at home yet.) This postcard \u201cexists\u201d somewhere else, perhaps, in some mysterious temporal ecstasy\/dimension, along with an issue of the M'Ars magazine (Moderna galerija, Ljubljana) that published articles on the aesthetics of the sublime.     Warhol, Stella came to your mind, Painter (... purely by accident, or perhaps not, I am oddly, strangely, making only American references...), and I \u201cskipped\u201d to Barnett Newman in memory, the \u201chere and now\u201d and Lyotard, to the \u201cKantian\u201d and \u201cLyotardian\u201d issues of the limitless\/the infinite\/the unrepresentable, that \u201chorrific\u201d, abhorrent, impossible, that which distinguishes \u201cjudgement of taste\u201d and canon, Beauty, kalokagathia from the aesthetics of genius, the sublime. Which we willy-nilly have to deal with, not for the first time, but always all over again, at least as we wander the fractal dimensions of the landscape of a certain past, \u201cin the company of the past\u201d (a reference to John Berger). By its very nature, the symbol of such a landscape as an Intro-\/Retrospective is supposed to be cannot by any means be unambiguous; it is not a \u201csignal\u201d like traffic lights, but something \u201cnatural\u201d, self-forming, contingent, irreducible to a term, always multifaceted and subject to reinterpretation. It is contradictory and inexhaustible, since it resists any notion: if it were possible to reduce it to a term, we would not need symbols, we would dream up \u201cconcepts\u201d. (No, not everything is on the surface, as Warhol quipped, nor is it what it is, as Stella claimed.)     The problem of Topos, topology, maps\/territory... This also runs deeper, shattering\/entangling, penetrating the \u201csurface\u201d, even in Hakim Bey\u2019s works (The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism (TAZ) and other texts), and in Houellebecq\u2019s novel The Map and the Territory.     Bey succinctly formulates the deceptiveness of the \u201cmap\u201d: \u201cThe \u2018map\u2019 is a political abstract grid, a gigantic con enforced by the carrot\/stick conditioning of the \u2018Expert\u2019 State, until for most of us the map becomes the territory \u2013 no longer \u2018Turtle Island\u2019, but \u2018the USA\u2019. And yet because the map is an abstraction it cannot cover Earth with 1:1 accuracy. Within the fractal complexities of actual geography, the map can see only dimensional grids. Hidden enfolded immensities escape the measuring rod [emphasis B. Cerovac]. The map is not accurate; the map cannot be accurate.\u201d4 (emphasis H. Bey).     From this ontological-anarchist digression (Bey), I return to a seemingly narrower topic\/subject: a possible staging of a Retrospective Exhibition.     My thesis: a new set-up is, in itself, necessarily contingent, a new event\/projection in a 3D \u201cbox\u201d (\u201cenclosure\u201d\/\u201cgrid\u201d\/\u201dstructure\u201d\/\u201dconstruct\u201d) of temporal space or \u201cspatialized\/unfolded\/exhibited\u201d time: The Landscape cannot in any way be deduced from the history of all previous events-acts-works-installations-performances-events; in that regard, existentialism is in the right. Achille Bonito Oliva (The Ideology of the Traitor) is also right about something. It is not true that it is the task of the critic, or even the \u201cself-critic\u201d, the curator, or the philosopher, to be \u201cobjective\u201d; no, (s)he needs to create some \u201cconcept\u201d, \u201cconceive\u201d something. To choose someone, something (artists, works...) and fight for that, as a Subject, not by acting as, supposedly, a scientist (whose work is also necessarily susceptible to selected axioms, premises, measurement systems, paradigms, preconceptions, bias). In a certain creative sense, you end up at the beginning of a new situation. That Opus Magnum, Mysterium Coniunctionis, was \u201cnot on the agenda\u201d at the beginning, except in the sense of Bergson\u2019s view (which I highly appreciate) that time transpires \u2013 from the future: first there is the future, then comes the \u201cpresent\u201d: the here and now (Barnett Newman), and it just \u201cpasses\u201d into some form of was\/were, the past, into a supposed \u201cnon-being\u201d. There was no brain at first that only later began to \u201cfunction\u201d, perceive, think... As if the \u201cfuture\u201d acts in advance, \u201ca priori\u201d upon the legendary \u201cbeginnings\u201d of the actions we now reconstruct, set forth retrospectively; still elusive, complex, ambiguous. Ek-static, the ecstatic nature of time, existence, the subject of perception\/action\/thought is a strange \u201cthing\u201d, as is the Ding an sich, about which we can neither see nor scientifically claim anything beyond the phenomena, works, \u201cinstallations\u201d in 3D projected in the \u201cblack gallery\u201d of Time-Space. How can \u201cit\u201d in itself \u201cappear\u201d without it? To whom?     Thus, the Introspection-Retrospective project is necessarily some kind of \u201cmeasurement system\u201d, an \u201caccelerator\u201d, which implies the involvement of the Subject in the whole process, without any claims on a \u201cfinal solution\u201d. No, not everything is on the surface.     Internal Voices, Internal Views     During the 1980s, I wrote several essays,5 discussions that touch upon aesthetic problems that we think and converse about initially when preparing for a Retrospective.     In the essay titled \u201cBeing and Space\u201d (a critique of Heidegger\u2019s reinterpretation of Kant) I point to the problem of \u201csimultaneity\u201d of any \u201chistorical\u201d, \u201ctemporal\u201d set-up, even the form of Exhibition (a Retrospective one in this case).     Here is an excerpt, a fragment of the discussion, for the purpose of further \u201cwork on the material\u201d, a talk about the exhibition: I quote myself, after three and a half decades of formulating these sentences:     \u201c\/...\/ The simultaneity of something can be conceptualized as internal without being transcendentally enabled by the formal condition of time \/...\/ \u2018Simultaneity\u2019 is not a matter of time, since it is not primarily about the succession of a subject-object of events or temporal ecstasy, neither is it about temporal transcendence, nor about temporal self-affection, for the coexistence of all those coming from different domains of experience cannot be substantially understood or explained by \u2018temporal synthesis\u2019 or schematism as supposedly purely temporal. \/ We have merely come to the conclusion that without referring to the production power, spontaneity and receptivity of transcendental imagination and its formation of schemata, temporality and spatiality would be absolutely unthinkable, since only \u2018full\u2019 and substantively educated existence \u2018transpires\u2019 and \u2018extends\u2019. \/ Time and space do not fade away as empty forms only because they originally form part of the structural whole of the world\u2019s shaping, of its integral formation \/...\/\u201d6 An ideal Intro-\/Retrospective projection would be something extremely sublime: an absolutely infinite and unrepresentable fullness, for whose excavation from the pit of a radical past there is no adequate archeological method. Therefore, we need to dig it up and re-think it, re-examine it, with respect to its ambiguity. From the dark depths of the \u201clast millennium\u201d! How to deconstruct this extremely differentiated and \u201cexcessive\u201d complexity using the superstructure\/infrastructure of one particular Intro-\/Retrospective whose problematic is equally difficult to grasp? This would now be \u201cour\u201d or the Author\u2019s task, \u201cduty\u201d. The past, which \u201cnow\u201d includes several decades of the \u201cformer\u201d Future, should be picked up, like mental and physical \u201cart material\u201d (Adorno). Not to approach it as a conservation, restoration, monumental, antique memorial assignment (Nietzsche, On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life), but by revolutionizing the form\/genre of retrospectives to make some transformation in terms of a jump, not from quantity to quality, but to some contingent, \u201caccidental\u201d novelty, which directs the phenomenology of the landscape, the territory towards the possible intuition of the phenomenon \u2013 noumenon relation, revealing\/hiding the disclosure (aletheia) of that invisible, \u201cintangible\u201d genius loci without which this and such a landscape would never have emerged. A landscape transformed with a new\/repeated look at the ancient place (landscape), the \u201celapsed time-companion-partner-companion\u201d... With the inevitable pain, suffering, sacrifice, renunciation, selection of \u201cmaterial\u201d, entailed by every (re-) creative display made of the body\/spirit of the past.     And deepened Introspection should be a sublime satisfaction for wasted time.     Cave, Fire, Burning Painting\/Anamorphosis     \/...\/ \u201cLanguage and culture are the most complex human systems, and they are my elementary homeland.\u201d \/...\/     \/...\/ \u201cHistory is not only a time of great and marvelous works, monuments, history is HYSTERIA, too. You have this dark side of human being, evils in human history and in present.\u201d \/...\/7     To radically diminish\/overcome the fate of the modernist white cube is particularly challenging. Temporality, ephemerality, inherent expenditures of every creature, every artifact, destined from the very start to displacement, skewedness, anamorphism, political incorrectness, ahistoricism, amorality, migration, anonymity, its eternal return through elemental processes like burning \u2013 this is one of the topics of radical examination in the practice of the V.S.S.D., the Painter.     Burning Painting \/ Anamorphosis, (Ljubljana, 8 February 1990) is a necessary \u201cZen\u201d slap to Culture by Physis, nature, in the pre-Socratic, Heraclitan sense. This artistic act of V.S.S.D., both poiesis and praxis, has a special ethical and theoretical or philosophical dimension, going beyond any political-ideological contamination and pragma. Its contingency, one-offness, affects the entire cosmos of Creation, humanist illusions and prejudice (that is, desires, aspirations, existential concerns, hopes, anxieties, interests). The pattern of behavior of this Painter with fire \u2013 with no stylistic idiom \u2013 belongs to the \u201cstyles of radical will\u201d and \u201caesthetics of silence\u201d (Susan Sontag). The work of difference (Jacques Derrida, On Grammatology) \u201csplits\u201d the monolithic corpus of art, and V.S.S.D. occupies the underground of Ljubljana and the \u0160kuc Gallery (in the radical 1980s) with its \u201cnon-museum\u201d, \u201cblackness\u201d, the total environment, only to finish it off with fire in the dawn of the \u201cdark\u201d 1990s.     Certain radical Bauboesque, maieutic (maternal, midwifery) interests in giving birth to specific \u201cnon-museum\u201d acquisitions in an underground warehouse \u2013 where they would occur a priori deprived of normal life pre-histories \u2013 were not realized by V.S.S.D., but were left to incubate in the \u201cmatrix\u201d of infinity, taken back to the realm of sublime, unrepresentable ideas.     The warehouse remained empty, never becoming a museum. "

      "text":" In the photogrammetry for the creation of point clouds, digital 3D models and orthophoto maps stereo pairs of aerial photos are used. These are two aerial photos showing part of the same area and the coverage position is somewhat offset. The area that is overlapped for the forward should be between 60-70 %. It is used for the stereoscopic view and complete coverage of the area of interest. The area that is overlapped for the sidelap should be between 25-40 %. It is used to ensure that no area is left unphotographed.     In an ideal case, an unmanned aircraft flies along straight and parallel lines in accordance with a flight plan. While in real circumstances, the aircraft (and camera within) direction and position can be disturbed by external factors causing anomalies in the overlapping of aerial photo pairs. When capturing aerial photos, we encounter two typical phenomena, which are the cause of the coverage errors. This is about Drift and Crab.     Drift Drift is the lateral shift or displacement of the aircraft from the planned flight lines that may be caused by the blowing wind or by the navigational errors. Drift may cause a serious gap between adjoining strips of photographs. Uncorrected drift results in subsequent photos covering more area in the prevailing wind direction.     Crab During side winds, if the pilot tries to maintain the original path, he has to turn the nose of the aircraft slightly against the wind. This makes the aircraft to rotate on its vertical axis. In this case, the original path is maintained, but the area covered by the aerial photo is much different from that planned originally. The photograph is rotated in the direction opposite to wind direction here. This defect is called as crab.     Crab occurs when the aircraft is not oriented with flightline. It causes a reduction in a stereoscopic coverage of the terrain. It can be corrected by rotating the camera around the vertical axis.     Drift is the result of not be able the unmanned aircraft to keep the planned navigation bearing. While crab is the result of being able to keep the planned navigation bearing but because of side winds, it doesn\u2019t have an alignment yaw position with the bearing. Because of extensive crosswinds, there is a great possibility that we will have a combination of the two situations, drift, and crab.     So it is said that it is good practice to capture aerial photos in calm weather conditions with as little wind as possible. In the case of excessive drift and, consequently, crab, it is often necessary to repeat aerial survey.     In order to eliminate these problems, modern unmanned aircrafts are already equipped with appropriate technological solutions. Among them, 3-axis camera stabilizer or gimbal is very effective. It is an electronic system that stabilizes the camera with the aid of gyros and electric motors so that it always keeps its horizontal position and proper orientation despite the drift or crab of the aircraft.

      "text":" Further information     Services     Programme and Priorities of the Slovenian Presidency     The priorities of the Slovenian Presidency were to a large extent determined in the 18-month Programme of the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies and in the Survey of the Inherited Agenda of the EU Council.     The five main priorities of Slovenian presidency are:     1. The future of the Union and timely entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty     After signing the Lisbon Treaty on 13 December 2007, all Member States have been concentrating on successful completion of ratification procedures in 2008 to allow the new Treaty to enter into force before the next elections to the European Parliament in 2009. The ratification process in the Member States has been so far successful. By mid-May, the new Treaty has been ratified by 13 countries, among them Slovenia. In cooperation with the institutions and Member States, the Slovenian Presidency also started preparation activities regarding implementation of the Lisbon Treaty.     2. Successful launching of the new Lisbon Strategy cycle     The Lisbon Strategy is one of the key priorities of the Slovenian Presidency. At the Spring European Council, the second three-year cycle of the renewed Lisbon Strategy was launched.The Strategy is starting to deliver benefits in terms of increased growth and more jobs, and therefore does not need radical changes to priorities or processes. Therefore, the new cycle 2008\u20132010 will focus primarily on implementation of the Reform Programmes. The work on priority areas as defined in 2006 will be continued. Individual areas have been updated and renewed, and certain measures have been underlined as the most important for the next period:     The field of knowledge and innovation has been given new impetus by creating the so-called \"fifth freedom\".     In the field of strengthening the competitiveness of business, especially SMEs, we put special emphasis on actions allowing SMEs to operate more effectively and develop rapidly in the single market, facilitating their access to finance and incentives for innovation.     On the other hand, great attention has been paid to the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy.     3. A step forward in addressing climate-energy issues     One of the priority dossiers of the Slovenian Presidency is the energy and climate change package, published by the European Commission at the end of January. The March European Council took note that the package provided a good starting point and a basis for agreement. Even more important is the commitment to reaching an agreement between Member States before the end of 2008. In order to facilitate the work in the coming months, we have defined the fundamental principles to be taken into account in the distribution of effort between Member States. It is of utmost importance to adopt a legislative package before 2009, if the EU wants to play the leading role in achieving an agreement on a new international climate accord in Copenhagen in December 2009. The Slovenian Presidency has been trying hard to make progress in reaching political agreement concerning the third internal market package for energy.     4. Strengthening of the European perspective of the Western Balkans     Stability of the Western Balkans is of utmost importance for security and prosperity of the entire Union. Therefore, the Presidency is convinced that building the European perspective of the Western Balkans countries should remain a major item on the EU agenda. Slovenia strives to complete the network of Stabilisation-Association Agreements with all countries in the region and to enforce regional cooperation in several fields.     5. Promoting the dialogue between cultures, beliefs and traditions in the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.     In the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the Presidency endeavours to strengthen the intercultural dialogue within the EU as it is the very foundation of the co-existence of all European citizens. It is important to popularise the value of intercultural dialogue among the European public at large. The Presidency will particularly strive to promote the intercultural dialogue with the Mediterranean countries, the Western Balkans, and other regions. A special Slovenian contribution in this context is the initiative for establishing a Euro-Mediterranean University in the city of Piran. "

A well marked footpath leads from the car park near main road to the beautiful blue-green small lake - the source of the Sava Dolinka river. The lake then spreads eastward into an extensive marsh. In the past this area has undergone important geological changes . Now it attracts with its rich fauna nad flora. Due to the humid ground, special plants like \u00bbrosika\u00ab , the meat eating plant grow there. Some rare and endangered animal species have preserved there,too. In 1992 the Zelenci area was proclaimed the natural reserve.     Tamar (1108m)     Planica valley extends into the picturesque Alpine Tamar Valley \u2013 starting point for extreme mountaineering in the Julian Alps. It is surrounded by magnificent mountains of Mojstrovka, Ponce and Jalovec (the most beautiful peak in the Julian Alps, the symbol of Slovene alpinists).     Right at the foot of magnificent mountain walls the green oasis with the Mountain Hut Tamar is situated. This place used to be a pasture with the sheperd' s cottage in the place of Present Tamar Hut. Not far from The Hut, in the steep mountain walls of Mt. Ponce takes its source the Nadi\u017ea river which forms a beautuful waterfall but after 100 m sinks underground and springs out again at Zelenci as the Sava Dolinka river.The villlage of Rate\u010de gets its water supply from Nadi\u017ea which is an excellent drinking water. The Chapel of Our Lady Of Good Help was built in 1936 on the iniciative of the then priest in Rate\u010de Josip Lavti\u017ear. In 2002 the Chapel was renovated on the iniciative of the priest Marko Benedik and in accordance with the conception of our renown artist p. Marko Ivan Rupnik. The renovation has reached its climax in marvellous mosaics made by p. Rupnik and the group of his assistant from Centro Aletti in Rome. Church service \u2013 every Sunday in July and August- at 3 pm.     Tromeja - Pe\u010d (1510m) Three Countries Border     The village of Rate\u010de is \u00bbleant\u00ab to the sunny side of Mt. Pe\u010d (1500 m). The Three Countries Meeting Point can be a pleasant walking tour. The woodpath leads from the \u0160urc Inn , past the meadows and then right to The Three Borders Crossing Point from where we can enjoy a wonderful view of the surrounding valleys , villages and mountains. At this very important European crossing of the three Europeans nations and cultures a monument was erected in 1994- dedicated to the understanding and friendship among the three nations.     PEACE IS NOT ONLY THE ABSENCE OF WAR, PEACE IS HARMONY, PEACE IS LOVE, COMPLETION AND TOLERANCE. (Sri Chinmoy)     Mangartska-Belope\u0161ka jezera     Mangart or Bela pe\u010d Lakes , approximately 10 km from Rate\u010de on the Italian side of the border used to belong to Slovenia; only after the World War I the new border separated them from our country. They can be reached either by car following the road as far as Bela Pe\u010d ( Fusine Laghi) and then turning left , or by bike and on foot taking a woodland path heading south through the meadows and woods.. The extensive area is distinguished by its marvellous flora and fauna and by two extraordinary beautiful lakes - the Lower and the Upper one- framed by abrupt mountain walls and with the fourth highest mountain in the Julian Alps, Mangart, rising to the south.     In 1971 the area was proclaimed a natural park. In its centre there is a museum with a fine collection of hand- made tools. Visitors can enjoy in the breathtaking lake view and the view of the mountains. There is a variety of walking routes round the two lakes and from the Lower to the Upper one. And more skilled mountaineers can go up to the top of Mt. Mangart or Ponce. Not far from the Upper Lake , on an open meadow, the herdsman from Rate\u010de tends the flock in summer. "

      "text":" Fast method for measuring the Sr-90 activity with Cherenkov radiation in silica aerogel     Povzetek     Cerenkovo sevanje, ki ga v prozorni snovi povzrocijo hitri nabiti delci, je temelj razlicnih metod za detekcijo in identifikacijo delcev. Kot izvore Cerenkovega sevanja so do sedaj uporabljali plinske in trdne (oziroma tekoce) sevalce. Prag za sevanje fotonov je za pione v plinskih sevalcih nad 2,5 GeV\/c, v trdnih (teko?ih) pa pod 0,2 GeV\/c, medtem ko vmesno podrocje ostane nepokrito. Gre za kinematicno obmo?je, ki je bistveno pri proucevanju redkih razpadov mezonov B. Ti procesi so predmet raziskav vecih eksperimentov, od teh nekateri ze potekajo, drugi pa so v pripravi. Resitev prinasa silicijev aerogel, porozna snov z lomnim kolicnikom med 1,005 in 1,06. Rezultati, dobljeni pri eksperimentih HERMES in BELLE kazejo, da bi bilo smiselno tak sevalec uporabiti tudi v detektorju Cerenkovih obrocev s tankim sevalcem brez fokusiranja s sistemom zrcal (t.i. proximity focusing RICH). Prednost takega tipa detektorjev je v kompaktnosti, ki je posebej pomembna pri spektrometrih ob visokoenergijskih trkalnikih. Z uporabo boljsih aerogelov ter v zadnjem casu razvitih vecanodnih fotopomno?evalk nameravamo razviti uporabno metodo za detekcijo Cerenkovih fotonov. Pri tem bomo za odpravo ucinka neaktivne povrsine fotopomnozevalk uporabili sistem zbiralnih lec. Razvoj stevca Cerenkovih fotonov ponuja potencialno uporabo pri detekciji izvorov beta. Posebej zanimiva je detekcija visoko radiotoksicnega izotopa Sr-90 v okolju. Z izbiro aerogela s primernim lomnim kolicnikom lahko dosezemo, da le beta elektroni z dovolj visoko energijo sevajo cerenkove fotone, tako je na primer prag v aerogelu z lomnim kolicnikom n=1,06 pri 1 MeV. Na ta nacin lahko locimo prispevke razlicnih radioaktivnih izotopov. V okviru predlaganega projekta bomo z modeliranjem fizikalnih procesov, ki jih povzrocijo beta elektroni, ter ozadja zarkov gama in kozmicnih delcev, optimizirali parametre detektorja.     Summary     Cherenkov radiation caused by fast charged particles in a transparent medium is the basis for different methods of particle identifiaction. Up to the present, gaseous and solid (or liquid) radiators have been used as sources of Cherenkov radiation. The threshold for photon emission of pions is above 2.5 GeV\/c in gases and below 0.2 GeV\/c in solids (or liquids). The intermediate uncovered gap is essential for the investigation of rare B meson decays, which are the research subject of many experiments, some in progress, others in preparation. A solution to the problem is offered by silica aerogels, a porous material with refractive index between 1.005 and 1.06. The results obtained in two particle physics experiments, HERMES and BELLE indicate that it would be meaningful to use such a radiator also in Cherenkov detectors with thin radiators without focusing systems of mirrors (so called proximity focusing RICH).The advantage of such detectors is their compactness, which is especially important for experiments at the high energy colliders. By making use of improved aerogels, recently developed multianode photomultiplier tubes and additional lens systems for elimination of the inefficiency due to the PMT inactive surface, we propose to develop a method for detection of Cherenkov photons. A possible application of the Cherenkov photon detector could be for detection of beta particles. Of special interest is the detection of the highly radiotoxic isotope Sr-90 in the environment. A choice of aerogel with suitable refractive index allows one to select the threshold energy of beta electrons, which would radiate Cherenkov photons. Thus one may separate the contributions of different radioactive isotopes, in particular the rather energetic ones from Sr-90 daughter isotope Y-90. By modeling the physical processes produced by beta electrons and the gamma and cosmic ray backgrounds, we intend to optimize the detector parameters to allow for quick measurements of low activities of the isotope Sr-90 in environmental samples.

The gallery was managed by Obalne galerije - Coastal Galleries. In 2014 the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia decided to rent a biennial exhibition space in Arsenale. See below the archival article.     Archival article     The A plus A, Slovenian Exhibition Centre in Venice is a non-profit exhibition space established in 1997, as a centre for the promotion of contemporary Slovene and international art. Up to 2014 it served as a site of the Slovene Pavillion for both the Venice Art Biennial and the Venice Architecture Biennial. Since 2014 the Slovene artists have been presented at Arsenale.     The gallery operates year-round to host temporary solo and group exhibitions of mostly Slovene artists. It has established a network of contacts between civic and foreign institutions and organises round tables, performances and video projections, thus offering a panoramic view of today's artistic expression and a point of meeting, exchange and critical dialogue.     Background     The A+A Gallery first opened its doors in 1992 in Madrid, inside a space divided by a corridor (hence the name A plus A) restored by architect Boris Podrecca. After five years of activities co-ordinated by Lidija \u0160ircelj, the gallery moved to Venice, near Palazzo Grassi.     Venice Art Biennial participation     In 2015 JA\u0160A presents UTTER \/ The violent necessity for the embodied presence of hope, curated by Michele Drascek and Aurora Fonda.     Jasmina Cibic's project entitled For our Economy and Culture, curated by Tev\u017e Logar and produced by the City Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana in cooperation with the \u0160kuc Gallery, was selected to represent Slovenia at the 55th Venice Biennial in 2013. The exhibition is accompanied by the conference.     Sculptor Mirko Bratu\u0161a represented Slovenia at the 54th Venice Biennial in 2011 with the project dubbed Hot Emotion Heaters. At the A+A Gallery the two-metre-high clay figures called Hypocrites (previouosly shown at the Bo\u017eidar Jakac Gallery, Kostanjevica na Krki) were exhibited in the lower gallery grounds, while new, smaller statues were displayed in the upper room, and linked to the Venice environment and the biennial's concept ILLUMInazioni.     At the 53rd Venice Art Biennial in 2009, Miha \u0160trukelj's project x=0 \/ y=0: Interferences in Process. He examined the issue of perception in five equal segments: notes on a board, drawings, works on tracing paper, Lego-pictures and paintings as the final segment. This work was further based on researching the mechanism of perception, which \u0160trukelj analyses with the aid of traditional representational media \u2013 painting and drawing \u2013 but so as to include critical examination of the act of perception and the act of painting as committed existential acts of the contemporary subject.     At the 52nd Venice Art Biennial in 2007 Tobias Putrih featured in two-parts the project Venetian, Atmospheric. The first part of the installation, exhibited inside the gallery, included several maquettes, drawings, photographs, and sculptures which explored and questioned the relationship between architectural space and the scale models which precede it. The second, main part of the project was set up in a garden on the Island of San Servolo and consisted of a full-scale pavillion, a movie theatre.     Ten years after Russian-born artist Vadim Fi\u0161kin represented Russia in 1995 at the Venice Biennial, Fi\u0161kin's project Another Speedy Day was presented in the Slovene Pavillion at the 51st edition of the biennial. After forging professional and personal bonds in Slovenia he has become considered as a Slovene artist whose presence in Ljubljana contributes significantly to expanding the field of contemporary art in Slovenia.     Venice Architecture Biennial presentations     In 2014 the project The Problem of Space Travel - Supre: Architecture by the Cultural Centre of European Space Technologies (KSEVT), in 2012 the 100 YC (Maribor - 100 Year City) and in 2010 the All Shades of Green project by Studio AKKA and Studiobotas were presented at the Venice Bienniale of Architecture, supported by the Ministry of Culture at A plus A Gallery in Venice.     In 2008 the project Ljubljana \u2013 Venice: Urgent Need for New Urban Policy presented an architectural and urban comparison of the two cities, Ljubljana and Venice. On the 2006 Architecture Biennial Slovene participation was designed as a cabinet of ambient environments and icons entitled Formula New Ljubljana created by the SADAR + VUGA Architects in A+A Gallery and other locations in Venice.     Some other exhibitions     In 2008 A plus A gallery presented the exhibition The Partisans in Print: Slovenian Partisan Press & Graphic Art since 1941, curated by Donovan Pavlinec, featuring previously unpublished material in Italy: Slovene Partisan press, incisions, xylography, wartime banknotes and bills of exchange with reproductions of the patriotic activists designed by Slovenian artists and architects. Organised in co-operation with the International Centre of Graphic Arts in Ljubljana, in collaboration with the Slovenia's National Museum of Contemporary History, the exhibition and the accompanying catalogue offered a rare opportunity for scholars and members of the public to peruse visual testimony of social and political engagement at a critical moment in history.     Culture.si offers information on Slovene cultural producers, venues, festivals and support services, all in one place. It encourages international cultural exchange in the fields of arts, culture and heritage.

Palazzo Corsini, Florence     BIAF, the International Biennale of Antiquities in Florence, is the most important antiquarian art fair in Italy. The Florence biennale began in 1956, when the brothers Mario and Giuseppe Bellini enclosed in a single venue, then it was Palazzo Strozzi, more than a hundred selected art dealers. They allowed buyers, curators or simple enthusiasts to see closely what the market offered the best. They were therefore the precursors of a system that was then adopted throughout the art world and still valid today. Plenty of novelties were introduced since then, the venue has changed, from 2001, the fair is held in Palazzo Corsini, and in 2015 the new Secretary General, Fabrizio Moretti, has been appointed.     Despite his young age, Fabrizio Moretti, is one of the most prominent antiquarian, as well as a member of the executive committee of TEFAF in Maastricht, the exhibition committee for Frieze Masters in London, and of the scientific committee of the Uffizi Galleries in Florence. Son of the prominent art dealer Alfredo Moretti, Fabrizio founded Galleria Moretti in central Florence in 1999, focusing on Old Masters. Just some years after, in 2005, he opened Moretti Fine Art in London's New Bond Street, relocating after to St James's. He expanded his business in Monaco in 2017, with the opening of a third gallery space, overlooking the Place du Casino.     Regarding the Biennale, Moretti is a great advocate of the opening towards modern and contemporary art, but with the aim to attract collectors, apparently more interested in their own time, to the timelessness of old masters. To give even more freshness to both, old masters and his name, he decided to collaborate with Fabrizio Moretti, the musician with the same name, from the New York band The Strokes. They organised a joint exhibition, Fabrizio Moretti x Fabrizio Moretti | In Passing, that was on display at the Sotheby\u00b4s New York on 15 - 18 December 2019. It consisted of more than twenty paintings and statues of ancient masters from the stock of Moretti gallerist, in an interactive installation by Moretti musician, which led viewers to look at works in non-traditional ways, such as kneeling, or giving them an unusual glow with neon light effects.     2. Duo Moretti     Returning to the biennale, the thirty-first edition was held from September 21 to 29 at the Palazzo Corsini. Of the 77 national and international galleries, specialized in the most diverse artistic disciplines participating in fair, 16 were at their first experience at BIAF. Following the trends, the fair has opened to modern and contemporary art, with the time limit in 1990. The International Biennale of Antiques in Florence celebrated 60 years of activity (1959-2019) by promoting the first Florence Art Week, a week of events, exhibitions, performances and meetings that involved all the Florentine galleries, from ancient art to contemporary.     Among the exhibitions, the Galleria Poggiali, a new entry at the fair, presented works by Gilberto Zorio and Enzo Cucchi. The Galleria Bacarelli Antichit\u00e0 organized, in collaboration with the Galleria Botticelli Antichit\u00e0 and the Galleria Continua from San Gimignano, a display that combined Renaissance and Neoclassical works with pieces by Michelangelo Pistoletto, Anish Kapoor and Daniel Buren. \"Secondo Novecento according to Roberto Casamonti\" was the subject of the exhibition at the Palazzo of Bartolini Salimbeni. All ninety masterpieces from the time-period 1960-2000, including the works of Tony Cragg, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Alighieri Boetti, are part of the collection of the famous owner of the gallery Tornabuni Art. In the splendid Medici gardens, the Ancient and Renaissance sculpture joined contemporary art with the exhibition \"Tony Cragg in Boboli\".     Another interesting innovation of the thirty-first edition of BIAF was the close collaboration between the event and Google Arts & Culture. Through the Google Street View technology, it was possible to make a 360-degree virtual tour of the visit path of the Biennale through the spaces of Palazzo Corsini.     The peculiarity of the Florence biennale are the prizes for the most outstanding works of art in several categories, which were on display on stands. The Ugo Pierruci Prize for Painting was awarded to the work of Daniele da Volterra, Madonna with Child, San Giovannino and Santa Barbara, from 1548, exhibited by Mehringer-Benappi. At the fair, it was bought by the Uffizi Gallery for a sum of around two million euros. The Prize for Sculpture was delivered to Altomani & Sons for the San Giovanni Battista, a terracotta sculpture by the Master of San Giovannino, now identified with Benedetto da Rovezzano.     With the Ronald S. Lauder Prize for Decorative Arts and Design has been distinguished the armor belonging to the Count Galezzo d\u00b4Arco, made in the workshop of Tommaso Negroni in 1445-1450 and exhibited by Peter Finer. In the same discipline, three Mentions of merit were also awarded, to Alessandra Di Castro for the golden rose made by Bartolomeo Bulgari for Pope Pio IV Medici in 1564, Iotti Antichit\u00e0 for the pair of Genoese consoles from the 18th century and Dario Ghio for a particularly representative collection of ancient corals.     In addition, the Lorenzo d'Oro Prize was given to Antonio Paolucci - art historian, former Minister for Cultural and Environmental Heritage, Director of the Vatican Museums and Superintendent for the Florentine Museums - for his commitment to the dissemination and promotion of the Italian art in the world.     To be coherent, let\u00b4s propose my subjective choice, justified more by the exceptional content than by the stylistic quality. Galerie Canesso presented at the fair a relatively small oil painting on wood panel (43 per 34 cm), The Chastisement of Love (Amore castigato). The author of the painting has been recently identified as the Mantuan painter Camillo Mainardi (Guazzalo between 1544 and 1549 \u2013 Castiglione 1608), who worked for the Gonzaga family. At the beginning, he painted for Orazio Gonzaga between 1576 and 1585, and then for Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, for whom he decorated some of the rooms in his palace in Goito, from 1586 to 1587. In early 1597, Mainardi is recorded as employed by Countess Giulia Gambara in Brescia.     3. Galerije Canesso: Camillo Mainardi, The Chastisement of Love     The central figure, seen from behind, and wearing a helmet and armour, is recognizable as Mars, beating Cupid, bound and kneeling figure at his feet. Mars is tormented by a monstrous female figure with snakes in her hair, and coloured wings, possibly one of three Furies. In the background, we see a nude female figure, probably Venus, with tied hands and in a submissive pose. At Mars\u2019 feet, an inscription on a sheet illuminate the bizarre depiction: \u201cOMNIA VINCIT\/ AMOR\/ (E)T NOS CEDAMUS\/ AMORI\u201d (Virgil, Eclogues, 10, 69). Mars is whipping Cupido because guilty of having made him fall in love with Venus.     The iconography of this very special picture is not so easily decipherable, since the subject is somehow unique. In the Renaissance, we find innumerable depictions of the love couple Venus and Mars. Exceptionally some of them illustrate the punishment of Cupid, according to ancient examples, in which the mother, Venus, disciplines her son. Mantuan\u00b4s and Ferrara\u00b4s courts celebrated Amor, as we may deduce from the biographies of Isabelle d\u00b4Este or Lucrezia Borgia, and the poems of Pietro Bembo. M\u00e9nage \u00e1 trois, in which the elderly spouse played the role of a jealous Vulcan, clearly did not cause excessive scandal.     However, times have changed in the late 16th century. Mars, in our portrayal, is punishing Cupid with all the fury, and thus saving his masculinity. The unsteady hand of a child is guilty of indulging the invincible god of war in the love desire. The woman in the background is so very helpless, that it is almost unlikely that the almighty goddess of love would be represented. She may be one of the unlucky celebrities who succumbed to Cupid's arrows and, as Ausonius tells us in the late-Latin poem Cupidus cruciatus, finally punished the unlucky child.     How problematic became Eros as a divinity of love desire, is quite evident from the picture Sacred Love and Profane Love by Giovanni Baglione (1566-1643): Archangel Michael is in the act of defeating little Eros, already lying on the ground with his broken arrows. Finally, we find the parallel to our painting. Bartolomeo Manfredi (1582-1622), another painter in Caravaggisti style, depicted Mars hitting blindfolded Cupid, with Venus on his knees intent on stopping lover\u00b4s fury.     Compared to the manneristic and baroque perceptions of Eros, the neoclassical depictions of the god of lust seem almost completely unproblematic. Gallery Robilant+Voena presented a plaster cast Amorino, conceived by Antonio Canova (Possagno 1757 \u2013 Venezia 1822). Amorino was made for John Campbell who was the first important Canova collector in England. The two met during the grand tour that the English nobleman accomplished in Italy, between 1783 and 1788.     In addition to the Amorino, Campbell commissioned to Canova the first version of Amore e Psiche, today in the Louvre in Paris, which however the English nobleman never managed to obtain, not being able to pay the large transport costs. The marble of the Amorino Campbell, carved by Canova between 1788 and 1790, was Canova's first work to arrive on British soil (today at Anglesey Abbey, Cambridgeshire, National Trust). On its arrival, in 1791, was welcomed with general enthusiasm. As usual, Canova made several plaster casts also from Amorino Campbell. The first ones were aimed for collectors who had helped him in his early years: Senator Girolamo Zulian, Prince Abbondio Rezzonico, but above all Senator Giovanni Falier.     Giovanni Falier (1710-1808) was one of the most esteemed patricians of his time, a senator and a member of the Council of Ten. It was he, who helped Canova in the early years, and he was responsible for the commission of Canova's first sculpture, Euridice, made in 1773, to which followed three years after Orfeo (both placed by Falier in the family villa in Asolo, now both in Venice, Museo Correr).     The plaster cast was exhibited in Naples in the exhibition Canova e l\u00b4Antico (Napoli, Museo Archeologico Nazionale, 28 March \u2013 30 June 2019). This brings even more added value to the work, which is quite unique even without marketing and promotion. "

Julia Melkers and Eric Welch, UIC associate professors of public administration, and assistant professor Sharon Mastracci will use the three-year grant to focus on such networks in academia and government. Although women account for more than half of the professionals in biological and social sciences, their numbers are disproportionately low in other scientific fields, the researchers said.     NEW YORK (AP) - Women are now as likely to use the Internet as men - about two-thirds of both genders - yet a new study shows that gaps remain in what each sex does online. Men who go online are more likely than women to check the weather, the news, sports, political and financial information, the Pew Internet and American Life Project reported Wednesday. They are also more likely to use the Internet to download music and software and to take a class. Online women, meanwhile, are bigger users of e-mail, and they are also more likely to go online for religious information and support for health or personal problems.     Washington, D.C.

Because of this, new interdisciplinary theoretical and analytical methods and approaches are needed to improve our understanding of the shifting patterns of such practices in different parts of the world, with a particular focus on tackling its proliferation in the new media and radicalisation of online space in the contemporary, increasingly multicultural information society.     The aim of this colloquium is to give an overview of these phenomena as well as research and legal practices in Europe, USA, Japan and New Zealand in order to address the specific issues pertaining to the propagation of intolerant, abusive and hate content in the new media and to contribute to a better understanding thereof as well as to devise strategies for their containment and mitigation. The talks presented at the colloquium tackle a wide range of topics and on-line platforms, such as nationalist discourse on an on-line forum of white supremacy groups or explicitly and implicitly abusive discourse against the LGBTQ+ community of Twitter. The authors use a rich set of methodological frameworks, ranging from discourse-historical approaches to discourse studies to machine learning. The colloquium also offers a comprehensive legal analysis and recommendations for an improved treatment of hate speech in the new era from 10 EU countries as well as a contribution on hate speech that spills over the virtual world and enters the real-world streets.     TALK 1     Hate speech: what definition? What solutions?     Fabienne Baider, University of Cyprus, Cyprus     On 31 May 2016, the Commission and main IT Companies made public a Code of conduct targeting illegal hate speech online. The parameters chosen by the Commission are grounded in the Council Framework Decision 2008\/913\/JHA of 2008. In this framework hate speech is confined to illegal speech defined as an open call to violence or hatred against specific groups, targeted because of their race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. This study presents and analyses the results obtained within the EU program CONTACT focusing on online hate speech. In particular it evaluates the data from 10 countries within the EU. From these data we work out recommendation and a working definition of hate speech as \u2018abusive speech, calling for violence or hatred or not, against specific groups of people because of their origins, religion, including as well gender or sexual orientation\u2019. Some our conclusions include:     1. the necessity to use classification of hate speech based on prior studies carried out in the specific sociocultural context under study; so as to show how the EU definition may tone down the extent of illegal hate speech by using restrictive definition. Indeed we put forward the arguments for including legal hate speech in our data, a decision based on the reasoning that such speech may precede, accompany or provide the context for illegal hate speech;     2. the necessity to adopt a discourse analysis focused on specific and high frequency stereotypical words for specific groups and to avoid thinking of hate speech as the use of a common abusive languages for all groups but;     3. the need to take into account implicatures i.e. the implicit of dehumanizing metaphors or sarcasms. These implicatures do play role in escalating violence     4. The need for any automatic detection of illegal hate speech of contextualized research in the specific culture under study.     TALK 2     Bigotry online: Commenters responses to the \u2018give nothing\u2019 to racism campaign in New Zealand     Philippa Smith, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand     With a growing concern about the encroachment of \u2018subtle\u2019 racism (Ikuenobe, 2011) in New Zealanders\u2019 daily behaviour, this nation\u2019s Human Rights Commission, on 15 June 2017, sought to draw public attention to its pervasiveness by launching the \u2018give nothing\u2019 campaign. As part of this campaign the Commission engaged the New Zealander of the year \u2013 film director Taika Waititi \u2013 to front a satirical video which mimicked the style of a charity seeking support for a noble cause. In this case the irony was the request for New Zealanders to \u201cgive nothing to racism and the spread of intolerance\u201d (HRC, 2017). The video sought to use humour to make people more conscious of their choice of words and actions that, while subtle, could be racially offensive.     Taking the view that satire, as a \u2018discursive act\u2019, is only successful if the satiree (whoever received the satire) accepts it (Simpson, 2003), this study examines 115 online comments to gauge whether the satire was accepted or not, and in what ways commenters responded. Using the \u2018discourse-historical\u2019 approach of critical discourse studies (Wodak & Reisigl, 2001; 2009), I review the video and the online comments to understand the linguistic features and discursive strategies that operate in a triangle of relationships between the satirist, the satiree and the target (Simpson, 2003). Findings showed that while some commenters happily supported the campaign, the majority of them used the online platform for trolling and overt expressions of racism which, in itself offered some irony as to the campaign\u2019s concern with subtle racism.

TALK 3     What Does Hate Look Like: Twitter Discourse on LGBTQ+ in Slovenia     Vojko Gorjanc, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia     Since Twitter, as one of the main social platforms, plays an important part (also) in forming gender and sexual identities, we decided to perform a corpus-based study on the Twitter discourse pertaining to the LGBTQ+ community in Slovenia. The corpus for our study was extracted from the Janes corpus of Slovene user-generated content, which contains almost 215 million tokens of Slovene blog posts and comments, forum posts, news comments, tweets, etc. The corpus is rich in annotated socio-demographic and linguistic metadata, such as account type, author\u2019s gender and region as well as at the text level, such as text or sentiment. For the purpose of our study we extracted a sub-corpus of Twitter accounts of two key referendum campaign players who either supported or opposed the change of Slovenian legislation at the end of 2015, together with a) all tweets connected with both campaign with campaign hashtags and b) tweets with additional hashtags identified in previous context.     Our corpus analysis is quantitative and qualitative in its nature. The quantitative analysis with key words and sentiment analysis provides basic hints about the discourse used for the subsequent qualitative analysis. The qualitative approach is based on content analysis, followed by a critical discourse analysis exposing how one social group imposes power control over the other, and tries to limit the freedom of action of others, using the concepts of \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d as key concepts in forming gender and sexual identities.     We will show how persistent heteronormativity is\u2014also in Twitter discourse; so much so that it seems natural, whereas any counterforce is seen as disruptive, and this is a key factor for abusive discourse against the LGBTQ+ community. Since the qualitative analysis has been conducted manually, we also focused on the non-verbal parts of discourse. Our analysis thus shows that images in posts are very powerful discourse elements, both when the text is explicitly abusive as well as in cases when the verbal parts of tweets remains neutral on the surface, with or without abusive subtext, however with a very explicit abusive non-verbal component.     TALK 4     Hate Speech on Street Level in Japan \u2013 Interaction and Discourse between Hate Groups and Target Groups     Goran Vaage, Kobe College, Japan     Hate speech comes in many forms, both in terms of linguistic content and context. Furthermore, these two usually correlate in that hate speech from political organizations and other organized groups tends to centre around publicized covert racism, whereas at the other end of the spectrum, hate speech in computer mediated communication is often anonymous, derogatory and direct. Hate speech on street level, that is to say demonstrations, actual speeches, posters and such, falls between these two vertices, being semi-organized, taking place in the public space, but still being personal.     This talk analyses the interaction and discourse between hate groups and target groups on street level in Japan, based on a corpus gathered from fieldwork in the Kansai region of Japan in 2016 and 2017, other primary sources such as media coverage, and directions from stakeholder groups, for example banner wording recommendations.     The data suggests that the discourse from hate groups in Japan can be divided broadly into three types, ranging from discontent with current laws, welfare systems, and court decisions, urging members of target groups as well as the Japanese people to various measures, and more or less direct expressions of hate towards a certain target group or nation state. On the other hand, the discourse of the target groups and their campaigners, often outnumbering the hate groups, is more diverse, ranging from political counterarguments, explanations to by passers, offers of friendship, calls and protests against racism, to counterattacks on hate groups. The choice of message and discourse on both sides appears to be mostly a matter of personal choice, and even though the heat of the interaction can at times escalate, participants are in the public space where Japanese rules for social conduct still seem to apply, demonstrating that hate speech on street level is also a social act.     TALK 5     Chatbot abuse     Darja Fi\u0161er, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute and University of Ljubljana, Slovenia     Toma\u017e Erjavec, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Slovenia     Conversational agents, such as chatbots on the web, virtual assistants on smartphones and automated call handing systems are software agents which perform tasks or services for their users (Cassell 2000). As they are being introduced into everyday tasks and technologies, human-computer interaction is becoming an increasingly important research topic not only in computer science where researchers\u2019 primary concern is how to create a machine that can hold a conversation, but also in communication studies and social sciences where the social role of conversational agents is only starting to be investigated. One of the most underresearched phenomena in human interaction with conversational agents is the abusive behaviour of the users towards the agent, which is much higher in both volume and intensity, than in human-human interaction (Bartneck et al. 2005).     In this talk we present the results of a corpus analysis of the abusive language in conversations with the first on-line implementation of the first chatbot Eliza (Brade\u0161ko and Mladeni\u0107 2012). The chatbot, which was developed in 1966 and mimics the behaviour of a Rogerian psychologist, uses simple pattern matching and reformulates users\u2019 sentences into questions (see Figure 2). It is freely available on-line for visitors to use as they like, there is no additional documentation, specified rules or foreseen goals apart from a short prompt that acts as a conversation starter (see Figure 1).     The corpus contains all the conversations anonymous users held with Eliza over a period of 5 years (between 2002-12-19 and 2007-11-26), amounting to a total of 5.7 million conversations or 22.1 billion words. The goal of the corpus analysis is to investigate abusive language in computer-mediated settings in general and to contribute towards a better understanding of linguistic manifestations of abusive behaviour of users when engaging with conversational agents, their triggers, functions and consequences.

TALK 6     Darja Fi\u0161er, University of Ljubljana and Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Slovenia     Nikola Ljube\u0161i\u0107, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Slovenia     Toma\u017e Erjavec, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Slovenia     With the unprecedented volume and speed of spreading information on social media, content providers, government institutions, non-governmental organizations and social media users alike are facing an increasingly daunting task to identify and respond to the spread of intolerant and abusive content in a timely and efficient fashion, before hateful content can cause substantial harm. To address this issue, we propose an automatized approach that employs state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to identify and classify socially unacceptable online discourse practices (SUD).     In this talk we present the legal framework, annotation schema and dataset of SUD practices for Slovene as well as the prototype tool for automatic identification and classification of SUD on the Facebook pages of the most popular mass media in Slovenia that are being developed within the national basic research project FRENK (http:\/\/nl.ijs.si\/frenk\/english\/).     We believe the annotation schema, dataset and tool are the key stepping stones towards the a comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment of the linguistic, sociological, legal and technological dimensions of various forms of socially unacceptable discourse practices in Slovenia. From an applied perspective, the classifier has a big potential to be integrated into the daily work of moderators of discussions on the most popular forums and administrators of readers\u2019 comments on the biggest online media sites who cannot cope with the volume of posts with manual methods and are finding simple, in-house-built lexicon methods insufficient.     On a more theoretical note, we hope that research will result in a thorough examination of the characteristics of socially unacceptable discourse as a linguistic phenomenon and the social context in which explicit or implicit forms of discriminatory language are manifested. What is more, these insights will facilitate an improved understanding of the differences between legally acceptable and unacceptable forms of communication. "

The main objective of the project is to raise awareness on gender diversity, enhancing and strongly promote change of culture and behaviour in youngster in choosing and transition phases and in adult key-persons, regarding types, roots and effects of gender stereotypes and segregation in labor market. Related objectives are to bring young people and the adult key-persons to get involved in an innovative and develop a different vision of the professions, skills and opportunities in labor market gender perspective. This will require the decodification of stereotypes, its recognition and overcoming, acting on youngs and adults.     Through the project we expect to improve awareness and knowledge among young people regarding gender socialistation, increase knowledge among adults as key actors in choice and transition steps and widen the knowledge and awareness on the general biased vision of the professions, skills and opportunities for young people from a gender perspective.

      "text":" TECAR therapy     The term TECAR is an acronym for Capacitive and Resistive Energy Transfer. The use of TECAR technology is of major importance in rehabilitation therapies since it reduces pain, stimulates venous drainage in the lymphatic system, significantly reduces both muscular and back pain. In general, TECAR is used to treat disorders such as sprains, tendonitis, bursitis, osteoarticular distractions, chronic arthralgias, contractures, strains and muscular tears, myositis, pathologies of joint capsules, arthritic processes, lumbago and sciatica. Therapy is widely useful for treating all types of sports injuries. The TECAR method represents a technological innovation in the field of energy transfer in the diseased parts of the organism. From the other treatments that use the electromagnetic waves (ex. the ultrasound and the laser) the TECAR method is differentiated by the typology of the transmission of energy. In fact, TECAR therapy is not based on the induction of heat \"from the outside\", but rather on the stimulation of ionic charges naturally present in our muscular tissues through the application of particular electrodes. This involves a process of intensive stimulation of the tissues at the cellular level, which activate the blood circulation inducing an increase in temperature that accelerates a natural physiological reaction. TECAR therefore does not make use of the electric transmission from the outside, but involves the exchange of the electrolytes already present in the organism at the cellular level, with the aim of reactivating the circulation. Therefore, the process induces an increase in temperature in tissues that triggers the natural reaction of the organism, which is essential for the restoration of a considerable number of muscle and joint damage. This happens thanks to the combination of two mechanisms: increase of temperature in the deeper tissues and increase of the energy potential of cell membranes.     Thanks to the thermal effects (heating of the tissue), therapeutic therapy is often combined with manual therapy or passive stretching, where, due to local hyperthermia, a wider range of movement and faster muscle relaxation are obtained, while isometric muscle contraction stimulates the influence on the activation of individual muscle fibers. The TECAR therapy is a very pleasant treatment, since it involves an optimal feeling of heat, and which one can undergo with absolute tranquility since it does not cause collateral effects.     However, treatment is considered contraindicated for women during pregnancy, for individuals with pacemakers, as well as for neoplastic patients and for patients with a disturbed temperature detection.     reduces pain     improves superficial and deep blood circulation     improves tissue regeneration "

      "text":" RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR SCREENING OF ADULTS PARTICIPATING IN LEISURE-TIME SPORT ACTIVITIES     Katja A\u017eman Juvan University Medical Center Ljubljana, Zalo\u0161ka 7, 1000 Ljubljana     Keywords: physical activity, coronary artery disease, sudden cardiac death, SCORE system, exercise testing     Abstract     Participation in regular moderate aerobic physical activity and increased physical fitness is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality, which is after the age of 35 most often due to coronary events. On the other hand, moderate and vigorous physical exertion is associated with an increased risk for cardiac events, including sudden cardiac death in individuals harbouring cardiovascular disease. The risk-benefit ratio may differ in relation to the individual's age, fitness level and the presence and type of cardiovascular disease.     The latest position stand of the European association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation on cardiovascular evaluation in middle aged\/senior individuals, who are contemplating exercise or who are already engaged in nonprofessional competitive or recreational leisure sporting activity, is presented in the article. The aim of recommendations is to evaluate and encourage as many individuals as possible to participate in regular physical activity while minimizing the risk of cardiovascular adverse events. Recommendations are based on the individual's risk profile and the intended level of physical activity. Because of the large size of the population, an initial self assessment through health questionaire is proposed, relating to symptoms, risk factors for coronary artery disease and habitual exercise level. For those with positive self-assessed risk profile and those willing to perform high-intensity activities, a further risk stratification\/evaluation should be performed by a qualified physician. In individuals with an increased risk for coronary events, maximal exerise is advocated and then further (cardiological) evaluation when needed.

      "text":" Business after the death of a shareholder: What can a shareholder do for his\/her will to be respected as much as possible?     In the previous article, we presented the option of intestate succession when the deceased does not take any action. However, we are more in favour of the deceased\u2019s activity so that he\/she expresses their will in respect of the future of the business during his\/her lifetime, even though the legal theory and case-law currently do not yet offer any clear and concrete guidelines.     Generally speaking, anyone can express their will during their lifetime in a form of a testament for the case of death or by taking care of the transfer of their property in a form of other legal transactions.     A testament can be made by anyone capable of expressing their will and at least 15 years of age. A testament is valid when it is concluded in the form and upon conditions determined by the law. The most common forms of a testament are a hand-written testament, a written testament in front of two witnesses and a notary testament, whereas each of these must fulfil certain additional conditions. A testament may, in addition to the expression of will on who shall be the heir and what shall be inherited, also encompass legacy or debit. This means that the deceased could give certain persons the things or rights from their estate, or oblige certain persons to do something to the benefit of others (a legacy). The deceased may also set an obligation for the person that is being given a benefit from their estate (a debit). It depends from case to case on what the will of the deceased is and how to express such will in a form of a legacy or a debit (e.g. conclusion of certain business transactions of the company, etc.).     Certain business transactions, the consequences of which are far-reaching and not limited to the lifetime of the deceased can already be concluded during lifetime. In general, an authorisation can also be given for the case of death and with effect after death, of course with certain limitations and the possibility of cancellation by heirs.     The question remains, whether such authorisations are given by the deceased as the shareholder or the director. Such authorisations are indeed needed in practice, taking into account that with the death of a shareholder or a director, the company does not \u201cdie\u201d too, but rather continues with its business activities \u2013 and for that, it usually needs a shareholder, and most certainly a manager, e.g. a director.     The authorised person may be determined contractually or in a testament as an executor of a will (i.e. a person that is explicitly determined by the deceased and entrusted to execute everything required for the fulfilment of the provisions of the testament). Nevertheless, it might be worth pointing out that the authorised person and the executor of a will do not have an obligation to assume such obligation, therefore, the choice of the right person is very important. The deceased may determine other obligations of an executor of a will, but their primary duty is to take care of the deceased person\u2019s estate, administer it, take care of payments for debts and legacies, and especially to execute the testament in accordance with the deceased\u2019s will.     The legal theory abroad emphasises that a shareholder may, for example, determine the certain so-called \u201cinheritance clauses\u201d in the articles of association to determine the consequences in case of the shareholder\u2019s death.     It must also be kept in mind that at the moment of death of the deceased, a hereditary community is established, meaning that until its division, the property of the deceased is jointly administered by the heirs, which in our opinion includes the rights to administer a company. From the moment of death, the heirs assume the position of the deceased and have the chance to change his\/her will to a certain extent. If they reach consensus, the heirs can prevail over the will of the deceased, e.g. an agreement between the heirs (settlement) in the inheritance proceedings, a waiver of the right to heritage with an irrevocable statement, disregarding a possible testament. The deceased therefore cannot, even with the legal transactions described in this article, completely avoid the uncertainty of the faith of their company after death. He\/she can nevertheless contribute to as much certainty as possible by explicitly expressing his\/her will, even if the family is aware of it. Despite the fact that currently, the validity and enforceability of such expressed will in case-law and legal practice is not yet completely established, it is indeed better that a shareholder and a director expresses such will. By doing that, he\/she appeals not only to the court handling the inheritance proceedings, the register etc., but also to the moral duty of the family or the heirs to take into consideration the deceased\u2019s will with respect to the future of the company.

      "text":" About suffering, kitchens and the Atlantic Cod     \u00bbWhy suffer?\u00ab, is not only a religious, or better a philosophical question that has been around since the ages of man, but it can also be asked in a regular, common home kitchen. Why, for instance, do you bother and stir and mix a gooey and slimy mixture of cod and oil by hand for over an hour, if you could also use a blender and mix everything together in just 5 minutes or less? What are the higher goals for us to reach that we endure all the physical and psychological pain of modern humanity, for which plowing with a hand-held plow, washing dirty pants in a cold river and gathering wood for a fire seem just like a very distant memory? To make a spread of the Atlantic cod, also known as bakalar or polenovka here in Slovenia, the answer to this question is quite pragmatic. One of the essential components of the bakalar recipe is to keep the fibers in the fish meat intact, which give the spread a unique elegant structure and a perfect texture for easy spreading on bread. You don't have to resort to any of Nietzsche\u2019s theories, that the human suffering is the guiding point to productivity and to the will to live; it suffices to put your finger on the blender which turns the soft fiber-filled cod meat into an undefinable mass of porridge-like substance without any character or elegance at all. It is therefore not a coincidence that the Venetians as key holders of this very recipe named this spread baccala mantecato. Mantecato in Italian means to smash, stir, mix, a hand-motion of the sort in which we use our very muscles to work with. I can remember the face of my grandmother when she used to make whipped cream by hand, this act made her forehead glimmer with tiny balls of sweat. Her body was wrinkled-up and bent half-way over the bowl of cream on the kitchen table, her hands steadily whisking the mixture, her eyes sparkled like the eyes of a martyr, who bravely offers himself for the greater good. A torso worthy depicting of a master\u2019s hand. I guess that I very much have something of my dear grandmother Milena and I always work in the kitchen in the hardest way possible. But it\u2019s not as much of martyrdom but a tantric way of prolonging the satisfaction I get from it. One hour of suffering will bless me with a delicious spread, the tired body will get a good portion of high-quality fibers and good fats (with just the right texture), the soul on the other hand will, when achieving and eating this masterpiece, soar high in the skies like a mighty falcon. Of course there are shortcuts and believe me that you will want to cling on these with all might without any moral hesitations whatsoever. You know that there exist many American wonder-machines that can also easily whisk something up without any strains. These machines are mightier than the blender or a normal mixer, their whisks are sturdier than the normal hand-held ones and they will not break like mine did, when I mixed my half a kilogram heavy mixture with a normal whisk made out of weak wire. But as in everything we do you can find that certain \u201csomething\u201d, that certain surplus that needs to be made with sacrifices. In the balakar recipe that is using your own hands. It\u2019s true that it will not be as perfectly mixed than with a machine, which means that the fibers will take in less fats and the spread will not be consistently mixed-in and silky-smooth, but the taste of the Atlantic cod will therefore be clearer and straightforward. The spread consists mostly of fish and not of sunflower seed oil, like most of the spreads bought in supermarkets. Epicurus, the great antique pleasure seeker and the leading figure of hedonism mentions ataraxio, a state of deep ecstasy or inner peace as the climax of pleasure. The way to achieve this is not that long, not really complicated, a kind of short and whiny road, curved like a blood sausage - a bit of pickled cabbage and a glass of wine and we arrived at the destination. The Venetians would conjure their own menu for reaching nirvana and it would probably be something like this - white polenta fried on a bit of butter, bakalar, mixed and crushed by hand and a glass of dry sparkling wine of the grape sort pro\u0161ek. I myself rather tend to the Buddhists when it comes to this. But not that the stomach would be empty, I would just put a bit more vigilance (satori as they say) in the center of attention, rather than just the emphasis on feeding oneself. Suffering needs to be heard and found, the starting point of the uneasiness needs to be discovered with it. Food tends to suffocate the impulse of uneasiness, which is why the road to true awareness does not lead through hamburgers, truffles and not to say bakalars. Epicurus, I think you might have been wrong here. Maybe we will get a bit closer to the answer we seek with repeated, meditative work, with the work of mixing and mashing that is ah-so-more than just physical exhaustion. Well enough talking, I am already soaking another round of cod fish, but I invite you to join me and discover the roots of suffering and pain with me.     BAKALAR, VENETIAN STYLE \/\/ BACCALA MANTECATO     A spread made out of Atlantic cod and olive oil Ingredients for 4 tormented souls     35 dag dried Atlantic cod     2 to 3 dcl not too strong olive oil (refined sunflower seed oil can also be used)     1 spoon of black pepper grains     3 cloves of garlic     1 spoon of \u201csolni cvet\u201d (Fleu de sel or \u201cflower of salt\u201d) from Piran     A handful of parsley for decoration     First we make sure we have plenty of time to buy the cod fish. We are searching for air-dried Atlantic cod fish - Gadus morhua, which was caught in the North Atlantic oceans (marked FAO 27). The fish should weight at least half a kilogram and by chance be flattened, straightened by machines. If the fish body is still curved we will have to straighten it ourselves by beating on it with a wooden bat or the back side of an axe. Then we soak the fish \u2013 we put the cod into a bigger pot or a tub and fill it with cold water. The fish is dehydrated that is why we can only soften the meat while soaking. Leave the fish to soak for 3 to 4 days, depending on how thick the fish meat is. The water needs to be changed daily, especially on the first day. The fish can also be ideally soaker under running water (but my wife forbids me this because we are too ecologically aware). The next day we cut into the tail area of the fish so that the meat spreads and soaks the inner side of the animal even better. The soaked cod (gaining 3-times the weight than at the beginning) is cut into bigger pieces. For bakalar we use the parts of the fish that have the highest quality, which are the front side of the back and the stomach side with the longer fibers and a beautiful white texture of the meat. The cod is placed into a pot and filled with cold water. Add a bit of salt and cook on a medium heat so long, till the water starts to boil. We remove the foams that gather on the surface, take the pot off the heat, cover it with a lid and leave it to rest for 20 minutes. With a skimmer we move the cooked fish on a plate and wait till it cools off a bit, so much that you can hold it in your hands. We carefully remove the access skin, the spinal bone and all of the fishbones, bigger and smaller. The pieces of the cleaned meat are then put into a bigger bowl (the bowl should be in a round shape, because it is easier to mix the ingredients with a whisk). We heat the olive oil and roast the garlic cloves in another pot till the garlic has a golden-brown color. After that we remove the oil from the stove and remove the garlic cloves. We slowly pour the oil into the bowl with the fish meat and smash the meat with a hard whisk (it mustn\u2019t be too soft). We mix and smash the mixture in a reparative pattern so the ingredients mix with each other in a homogeneous mixture. We also mix in some of the liquid that was left from the cooking of the fish at the beginning (the skin consists of a gelatin-like substance that melts in the boiling water). The liquid will, because of the gelatin, bind all the ingredients together even better. We repeat the process, mix and mash, add oil and add the liquid for about 30 minutes. After this task we can rest a bit and prepare for another round of the same workout for another 15 minutes. The oil is added into the mixture for so long, till the fish starts to suck in the liquid. At the end the mixture is salted and peppered and mixed for additional 5 minutes, so the seasoning is spread evenly and we get a creamy spread without any bigger chunks of meat. The spread can be served immediately, spread out on toasted bread or added into cooked and fried polenta. For decoration you can also add freshly chopped parsley on the bakalar-sandwiches. Dry wine with a distinct taste of sourness is an ideal companion, some bubbly Prosecco, Soave or a more Slovenian Malvazija can also be freely enjoyed with the dish, as long as the wines do not have a strong taste of oak wood. The bakalar spread will hold up in the refrigerator up to 5 days.     Klemen Ko\u0161ir     I am a star-eyed observer; I watch the world unfold before me and I am amazed at everything I see. The human person is always my main focus, even when I chop up carrots or write down my recipes. I like to talk to people that work with their own hands and with the earths soil itself. At home I crouch down before my computer and type down every impression and every note form the last 5 years and I publish this at the very end in a book for everybody to read. Throughout this whole process I always stay a father, sometimes a little grumpy, other times cheerful and high in spirit. "

Injectable fillers also known as wrinkle fillers, dermal fillers or facial soft tissue fillers are soft gel substances that are injected under the skin to fill in deep facial lines and creases. They are also used for correction of defects or depressions in the face resulting from age or trauma, to restore volume loss from aging in areas such as the under the eye and cheeks, or to enhance the lips or cheeks. When performed by an experienced plastic surgeon and with appropriate filler for the specific application, soft tissue augmentation and dermal filling provide predictable and consistent aesthetic outcomes. Immediate results with minimal risks an almost no downtime together with the current trend toward less invasive nonsurgical rejuvenating procedures makes them increasingly popular. However, it should be kept clear that when used for correct indications they can temporary eliminate signs of aging and postpone more invasive surgical procedures but cannot replace them.

Depending on the type of filler and the depth at which it is injected fillers can be used :     for correction of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and skin folds. Most commonly treated are the nasolabial folds (which run from the nose to the corner of the mouth), marionete lines (that run down from the corners of the mouth to the jaw), vertical lines on the upper lip.     to increase the size of the lips as well as to improve the definition of the cupid\u2019s bow or vermilion border. Anybody considering permanent lip augmentation should preliminary try augmentation with absorbable filler to get an idea about the outcome.     to fill in the lines and hollowness underneath the lower eyelids called the tear troughs     to rejuvenate and add volume to cheeks or chin     to improve contour deformities and recessed scars     to rejuvenate the hands     to correct inverted nipples     What are different types of injectable fillers?     In recent years, the number of available fillers increased dramatically, expanding the range of options available to patients. The injectable substances vary considerably in physical properties and clinical performance. Based on the source they may be classified as autologous, biological, or synthetic and based on duration of cosmetic benefit they may temporary (short, medium or long lasting) or permanent.     Who should perform treatments with injectable fillers?     To reliably achieve successful outcomes, the physician must have a thorough understanding of facial anatomy and the injection technique to be employed. In addition different characteristics, capabilities, risks, and limitations of the injected material must be well known in order to provide optimal care and avoid complications. At the initial consultation, the relative merits of injectable fillers and other competing or complementary surgical treatments must be discussed with the patient. Duration of effect, advantages and drawbacks for each option should be clearly presented. The physician must also have the ability to prevent unnecessary discomfort during treatment, and must be able to identify and manage complications, should they arise during or after treatment. Our goal is to provide individualized treatment, taking into account factors such as the patient\u2019s social schedule, aesthetic preferences, desires and complications tolerance. Attention to differences in skin thickness and texture, area to be treated and age, warrant a customized approach for a natural result and high patient satisfaction rate.     What is most frequently used injectable filler?     The most popular fillers are those made from cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA), which is naturally occurring substance in our bodies. It attracts water and hydrates the skin. A major advantage of HA fillers is that they can be quickly and easily reversed by the injection of hyaluronidase (an enzyme which breaks down hyaluronic acid) into areas in which elimination of the filler is desired. The biocompatibility, long-lasting (but not permanent) effects, broad range of facial aesthetic applications, low incidence of complications, reversibility, and versatility are characteristics of HA fillers that guarantee good results and a high level of patient satisfaction. Therefore, only limited subsets of physicians and patients are willing to accept the higher complexity and risks associated with the use of permanent fillers.     How long does the hyaluronic acid filler last?     Different injectable fillers last different periods of time in different patient, since each patient, metabolizes filler differently. The results of objective scientific studies have shown that hyaluronic acid fillers last from 6-12 months. In areas of increased activity such as around the mouth fillers are absorbed faster compared to the other sites.     What are potential risks and disadvantages?     All of the injectable fillers are placed by an injection and carry the usual risks of bruising, swelling, minimal pain and local infection. With appropriate use, the most popular, hyaluronic acid fillers have less than 1% incidence of adverse reactions. In addition, complications are rarely serious and usually resolve without treatment. Resolution can also be significantly accelerated by injection of hyaluronidase. In contrast to these fillers, longer lasting and permanent fillers may produce undesirable effects and complications that are more difficult or impossible to manage. More serious adverse reactions include areas of excess fullness or nodules, allergic reactions, granulomatous or inflammatory reactions, migration of filler, severe infection. Complications associated with fillers may require injection of corticosteroids, treatment with systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics, surgical intervention or incision of the affected area with a large bore needle and expression of the filler.

      "text":" Trac supports \u200bmod_python, which speeds up Trac's response times considerably, especially compared to CGI, and permits use of many Apache features not possible with tracd\/mod_proxy.     These instructions are for Apache 2; if you are still using Apache 1.3, you may have some luck with \u200bTracModPython2.7.     Simple configuration     If you just installed mod_python, you may have to add a line to load the module in the Apache configuration:     Note: The exact path to the module depends on how the HTTPD installation is laid out.     On Debian using apt-get     (Still on Debian) after you have installed mod_python, you must enable the modules in apache2 (equivalent of the above Load Module directive):     On Fedora use, using yum:     You can test your mod_python installation by adding the following to your httpd.conf. You should remove this when you are done testing for security reasons. Note: mod_python.testhandler is only available in mod_python 3.2+.     A simple setup of Trac on mod_python looks like this:     The option may or may not be necessary in your setup. Try your configuration without it; if the URLs produced by Trac look wrong, if Trac does not seem to recognize URLs correctly, or you get an odd \"No handler matched request to...\" error, add the option. You will notice that the and have the same path.     The options available are     Python Egg Cache     Compressed python eggs like Genshi are normally extracted into a directory named in the users home directory. Since apache's home usually is not writable an alternate egg cache directory can be specified like this:     or you can uncompress the Genshi egg to resolve problems extracting from it.     Configuring Authentication     Creating password files and configuring authentication works similar to the process for CGI:     Configuration for mod_ldap authentication in Apache is a bit tricky (httpd 2.2.x and OpenLDAP: slapd 2.3.19)     You need to load the following modules in Apache httpd.conf     Your httpd.conf also needs to look something like:     Or the LDAP interface to a Microsoft Active Directory:     Note 1: This is the case where the LDAP search will get around the multiple OUs, conecting to Global Catalog Server portion of AD (Notice the port is 3268, not the normal LDAP 389). The GCS is basically a \"flattened\" tree which allows searching for a user without knowing to which OU they belong.     Note 2: Active Directory requires an authenticating user\/password to access records (AuthLDAPBindDN and AuthLDAPBindPassword).     Note 3: The directive \"require ldap-group ...\" specifies an AD group whose members are allowed access.     Setting the Python Egg Cache     If the Egg Cache isn't writeable by your Web server, you'll either have to change the permissions, or point Python to a location where Apache can write. This can manifest itself as a 500 internal server error and\/or a complaint in the syslog.     Setting the PythonPath     If the Trac installation isn't installed in your Python path, you'll have to tell Apache where to find the Trac mod_python handler using the directive:     Be careful about using the PythonPath directive, and not , as the latter won't work.     Setting up multiple projects     The Trac mod_python handler supports a configuration option similar to Subversion's , called :     When you request the URL, you will get a listing of all subdirectories of the directory you set as that look like Trac environment directories. Selecting any project in the list will bring you to the corresponding Trac environment.     If you don't want to have the subdirectory listing as your projects home page you can use a     This will instruct Apache to use mod_python for all locations different from root while having the possibility of placing a custom home page for root in your DocumentRoot folder.     You can also use the same authentication realm for all of the projects using a directive:     Virtual Host Configuration     Below is the sample configuration required to set up your trac as a virtual server (i.e. when you access it at the URLs like http:\/\/trac.mycompany.com):     This does not seem to work in all cases. What you can do if it does not:     Try using instead of     <Location \/> may, in your server setup, refer to the complete host instead of simple the root of the server. This means that everything (including the login directory referenced below) will be sent to python and authentication does not work (i.e. you get the infamous Authentication information missing error). If this applies to you, try using a sub-directory for trac instead of the root (i.e. \/web\/ and \/web\/login instead of \/ and \/login).     Depending on apache's configuration, you may need to use instead of .     For a virtual host that supports multiple projects replace \"\" \/var\/trac\/myproject with \"\" \/var\/trac\/     Note: DocumentRoot should not point to your Trac project env. As Asmodai wrote on #trac: \"suppose there's a webserver bug that allows disclosure of DocumentRoot they could then leech the entire Trac environment\".     Troubleshooting     In general, if you get server error pages, you can either check the Apache error log, or enable the option:     For multiple projects, try restarting the server as well.     Expat-related segmentation faults     This problem will most certainly hit you on Unix when using Python 2.4. In Python 2.4, some version of Expat (an XML parser library written in C) is used, and if Apache is using another version, this results in segmentation faults. As Trac 0.11 is using Genshi, which will indirectly use Expat, that problem can now hit you even if everything was working fine before with Trac 0.10.     See Graham Dumpleton's detailed \u200bexplanation and workarounds for the issue.     Form submission problems     If you're experiencing problems submitting some of the forms in Trac (a common problem is that you get redirected to the start page after submission), check whether your contains a folder or file with the same path that you mapped the mod_python handler to. For some reason, mod_python gets confused when it is mapped to a location that also matches a static resource.     Problem with virtual host configuration     If the <Location \/> directive is used, setting the may result in a 403 (Forbidden) error. Either remove the directive, or make sure that accessing the directory it points is allowed (in a corresponding block).     Using <Location \/> together with resulted in having everything handled by mod_python, which leads to not being able download any CSS or images\/icons. I used <Location \/trac> <\/Location> to circumvent the problem, though I do not know if this is the most elegant solution.     Problem with zipped egg     It's possible that your version of mod_python will not import modules from zipped eggs. If you encounter an in your Apache logs but you think everything is where it should be, this might be your problem. Look in your site-packages directory; if the Trac module appears as a file rather than a directory, then this might be your problem. To rectify, try installing Trac using the option, like this:     Using .htaccess     Although it may seem trivial to rewrite the above configuration as a directory in your document root with a file, this does not work. Apache will append a \"\/\" to any Trac URLs, which interferes with its correct operation.     It may be possible to work around this with mod_rewrite, but I failed to get this working. In all, it is more hassle than it is worth. Stick to the provided instructions. :)     A success story: For me it worked out-of-box, with following trivial config:     The is obviously the path you need to enter to the browser to get to the trac (e.g. domain.tld\/projects\/trac)     Additional .htaccess help     If you are using the .htaccess method you may have additional problems if your trac directory is inheriting .htaccess directives from another. This may also help to add to your .htaccess file:     Win32 Issues     If you run trac with mod_python < 3.2 on Windows, uploading attachments will not work. This problem is resolved in mod_python 3.1.4 or later, so please upgrade mod_python to fix this.     OS X issues     When using mod_python on OS X you will not be able to restart Apache using . This is apparently fixed in mod_python 3.2, but there's also a patch available for earlier versions \u200bhere.     SELinux issues     If Trac reports something like: Cannot get shared lock on db.lock The security context on the repository may need to be set:     FreeBSD issues     Pay attention to the version of the installed mod_python and sqlite packages. Ports have both the new and old ones, but earlier versions of pysqlite and mod_python won't integrate as the former requires threaded support in python, and the latter requires a threadless install.     If you compiled and installed apache2, apache wouldn\u00b4t support threads (cause it doesn\u00b4t work very well on FreeBSD). You could force thread support when running .\/configure for apache, using --enable-threads, but this isn\u00b4t recommendable. The best option \u200bseems to be adding to \/usr\/local\/apache2\/bin\/ennvars the line     Subversion issues     If you get the following Trac Error only under mod_python, though it works well on the command-line and even with TracStandalone, chances are that you forgot to add the path to the Python bindings with the PythonPath directive. (The better way is to add a link to the bindings in the Python directory, or create a file in that directory.)     If this is not the case, it's possible that you're using Subversion libraries that are binary incompatible with the apache ones (an incompatibility of the libraries is usually the cause). In that case, you also won't be able to use the svn modules for Apache ().     You also need a recent version of in order to avoid a runtime error () due to the default usage of multiple sub-interpreters. 3.2.8 should work, though it's probably better to use the workaround described in \u200b#3371, in order to force the use of the main interpreter:     This is anyway the recommended workaround for other well-known issues seen when using the Python bindings for Subversion within mod_python (\u200b#2611, \u200b#3455). See in particular Graham Dumpleton's comment in \u200b#3455 explaining the issue.     Page layout issues     If the formatting of the Trac pages look weird chances are that the style sheets governing the page layout are not handled properly by the web server. Try adding the following lines to your apache configuration:     Note: For the above configuration to have any effect it must be put after the configuration of your project root location, i.e. .     Also, setting seems to mess up the page headers and footers, in addition to hiding the documentation for macros and plugins (see #Trac8956). Considering how little effect the option has, it is probably a good idea to leave it .     HTTPS issues     If you want to run Trac fully under https you might find that it tries to redirect to plain http. In this case just add the following line to your apache configuration:     Fedora 7 Issues     Make sure you install the 'python-sqlite2' package as it seems to be required for TracModPython but not for tracd     Segmentation fault with php5-mhash or other php5 modules     You may encounter segfaults (reported on debian etch) if php5-mhash module is installed. Try to remove it to see if this solves the problem. See debian bug report \u200bhttp:\/\/bugs.debian.org\/cgi-bin\/bugreport.cgi?bug=411487     Some people also have troubles when using php5 compiled with its own 3rd party libraries instead of system libraries.

      "text":" A total of 99 E. coli urinary tract isolates were investigated for phylogenetic groups and 21 virulence related genes in relation to fluoroquinolone and sulfamethoxazole\/trimethoprim resistance. We found that the B2 group was by far the most prevalent among susceptible isolates, while resistant isolates were more evenly distributed among groups A, B2 and D. Isolates from the B2 group exhibited the highest prevalence of virulence factors. Virulence genes hlyA , iroN and kpsMTII were statistically associated with fluoroquinolone susceptible isolates and picU with     sulfamethoxazole\/trimethoprim susceptible isolates. Fluoroquinolone susceptible isolates of the phylogenetic group A were significantly associated with genes papGII , kpsMTII and iss and the susceptible group B 2 isolates with genes hra in iroN. Among isolates susceptible to sulfamethoxazole\/trimethoprim the presence of the hra gene     was statistically significantly associated with phylogenetic group B2, while among resistant isolates, papGII was associated with phylogenetic group D.     The analysis of the quality of X-ray structures from Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsZ proteins, which are deposited in the ProteinDataBank, gave a possibility to select a 2Q1Y (Chain A) structure as a template for future in silico research. Also several spatial models of FtsZ protein from Escherichia coli were reconstructed with on-line servers \u00bbSwis -Model Workspace\u00ab and I-Taser , than the most appropriate structure was selected. Basing on complex bioinformatic study, the model, which was rebuilt by SwissModel server from 2Q1Y (chain A) template, was supposed as the most significant.     UV-B irradiation of barley sprouts within the range of 0.5-4.3 kJ\/m2 induced an increase in the number of chromosome aberrations in the root meristem and pathologies in the reproductive system. Enhancement of cytomixis, increase of polymorphism and cytopathology of pollen grains were observed in the male generative     system. The inverse trend was observed when intensity of cytomixis was compared to the pollen grain sterility. Damages induced by low doses of UV-B radiation were eliminated neither by DNA reparation nor by cell selection and were preserved in many cell generations. High UV-B level led to the activation of cytomixis due to which the population of microsporocytes was released from the excess load. It is presumed that cytomixis present a form of cell selection which was induced by an excess of microsporocyte disturbances.     Cytokinins are known to attenuate defence responses of plants after elicitor application or inoculation with fungi. To evaluate their role in the regulation of colonisation of Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) seedlings with mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungus, we analysed the effects of zeatin riboside (ZR) on: i) growth of ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius and pathogen Heterobasidion annosum in axenic cultures, ii) colonisation intensity of selected fungi on P. abies seedlings and iii) induction of defence reactions of spruce seedlings following elicitor treatment. Mycorrhizal fungus P. tinctorius showed increased growth at concentrations higher than 10 -2 \u03bcM ZR that was accompanied by increased ergosterol concentrations. In contrast, decreased growth of pathogen H. annosum was observed at the highest ZR (10 \u03bcM) concentration. ZR treatment also increased colonisation of spruce seedlings     with the mycorrhizal fungus. Application of cell wall preparations of both fungi increased peroxidase (POD) activity in the roots of treated spruce seedlings, whereas only elicitors of H. annosum increased also phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity, levels of soluble phenolics and salicylic acis (SA) concentrations. Application of ZR     negated the increased activity of POD that was observed in elicitor treated seedlings, accompanied by increased levels of soluble phenolics in the roots of elicitated seedlings. In contrast, no effects of ZR treatment on PAL activity and SA accumulation could be observed. Our results suggest involvement of ZR in the regulation of cell     wall modifications during the fungal colonisation with P. tinctorius and formation of ectomycorrhizae, by affecting the growth of fungal partner and non-specific defence reactions of the plant host.     We evaluated the status of lynx in the Swiss Alps for the period 2005\u20132009. Even though the number of lynx presence signs remained almost stable between the present (2,068 signs) and previous pentad (2,091), there was a 7.6% increase in the area occupied by the 5-km circular buffers around the confirmed lynx signs of presence over the five years period (12,637 km 2). The north-western Swiss Alps (VI) remained the compartment with the highest number of chance observations. It was followed by compartments central Switzerland west (III) and north-eastern Switzerland (II). These sub-populations acted as source in the current pentad, as signs of reproduction were reported almost every year. The translocation to north-eastern Switzerland is still the only significant contribution to the spatial increase of the lynx range in the last 10 years in the Swiss Alps. The small and vulnerable north-eastern Switzerland lynx sub-population plays an important role for the Alpine population. There is hope that in the future this sub-population could act as stepping stone to the eastern Alps and together with individuals dispersing from the central Switzerland west (III) subpopulation would enable to found a new sub-population in central Switzerland east (IV). The status of the sub-population in the Valais (VII) is less clear. As only few signs of reproduction and mortalities were reported over the pentad, it acted more as sink than a source population. From the few signs of lynx presence reported in the remaining compartments (Grisons V, central Switzerland east IV and Ticino VIII) we concluded that only a few single lynx that did not yet establish the typical social organisation occur there. An occupancy-based population estimate from a parallel study resulted in about 111 (SE = 10) independent lynx for the period 2005\u20132009. This is higher than the 60\u201390 individuals estimated for the previous pentad.     We give a short overview of the monitoring results of lynx in the 5-year period 1995\u20132009. There is no confirmed evidence that there are lynx in the German Alps. Single individuals might have visited the area but signs occur only sporadically. In 2008 Large Carnivore Network has been established to identify and document signs of lynx, wolf and bear. It is the first step to systemize the lynx monitoring. A natural recolonization of the German Alps is not expected in the near future.     The tremendous development of science and technology has influenced many aspects of our everyday lives, society and environment. A good example of such technology is biotechnology. However, besides its promise, this technology has also raised several controversial issues to which answers are not easily available. With     increasing knowledge and applications on one side and controversy on the other the teaching of science is, anything but easy. Development of competencies for these issues, and questions like why, when, and how to integrate modern biotechnology into science education are becoming prominent in the near future. Nowadays, when we are confronted with issues of varying degrees of complexity and importance, it is necessary that teachers at all levels of education have the basic tools to cope with these issues. This is one of reason why we have attempted to establish what kind of knowledge, values and opinions about genetic engineering and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are characteristic for the students, future Elementary Teachers, at     three Slovene Faculties of Education. We collected answers of 360 questionnaires from pre-service elementary school teachers and analysed their statements from the field of general and classical genetics, modern biotechnology, legislation and the acceptance of different kind of GMOs. Prospective teachers have some knowledge of general and classical genetics and less knowledge about the use of modern biotechnology. They     have concerns and fears about different kind of GMOs, mostly negative attitudes towards different kinds of GMOs, or they hold no strong opinions about them. Microorganisms and plants are generally more acceptable than GM animal. Furthermore, more knowledge does not mean that individual GMOs are more acceptable.

      "text":" Pozdravljeni na arhiviranih straneh Akademije umetnosti UNG 2010-2020! Novo spleti\u0161\u010de: http:\/\/au.ung.si     Welcome to the archived website of School of Arts UNG 2010-2020! New website: http:\/\/au.ung.si\/en     The god in the wall     The writing of these blogs is being done later and later and the writing is becoming harder and harder. Should take a break from all the daytime activities for a bit before I burn out.     I mean, the filming session this morning was so intense I didn't even manage to obtain one single photograph to supply you with, so you'll have to take my words for it. We were extremely productive today, not only in the morning but the afternoon session (which I was not part of due to my expeditions uphill) as well. It went so well actually that we are done with the island, leaving us only with the boat shots (which will probably be finished tomorrow morning) and the underwater shots (Saturday). Hooray for us!     In the afternoon I hiked up the hills again under the scorching sun, but it was easier this time for my body appears to have gotten used to the abuse I am subjecting it to. Hopefully it can hold on until the end of the week. As I was walking uphill I came to a brilliant (maybe, we'll see) idea about my projects. I am going to put the photo series on the secondary track and will instead try to shoot a short movie about the last man in Komi\u017ea. I leaned heavily on Adrian's film project about a man who comes to Komi\u017ea to discover what happened to all the inhabitants of the island. Maybe we\u2019ll even directly connect the two films, who knows. The main part of the whole idea that has been haunting me (even in my sleep) since yesterday\u2019s trip to the tunnels was the face in the wall. So basically I\u2019ll try to shoot the man\u2019s journey to the tunnels and how he gets eaten by the god in the wall. Of course there will be more to it than that but I don\u2019t want to spoil any surprises.     As I reached the tunnels I managed to get a few good photos of the tunnels and I also shot a test for the film (both are below [you'll see the test shot tomorrow, because the net here is horrendous and it would take me 1 hour to upload a 50mb file] in their raw form, I haven\u2019t found any time for editing yet at all) and then it was already time to head back to dinner, cold shower and the evening presentations.     Which of course did not go as planned (surprise, surprise). First the key was missing and then the Belgians went and did a presentation of their past works instead of what we are working on right now. Somewhere in the middle of it all the workshop leaders disappeared to who knows where and then we also had to listen to the mentors presenting themselves and their work (which wasn\u2019t agreed upon yesterday either). But at least I got positive feedback on my projects, so I guess that counts.     Afterwards I actually took some time off and we went to listen to the end of the TBF\u2019s act (as Dalibor put it \u201ca Dalmatian-rap band) which were rather underwhelming, though supposedly their studio albums are way better than their live performances, so I suppose I\u2019ll give them a try when I get back home to an internet line that\u2019s better than 20kbps.     If the god in the wall does not devour me first.     P.S.: SS \u010calamad\u00e9 has been repaired and is in operating shape once more, hooray! "

      "text":" GPS tracker vehicle locator - up to 100 days tracking     Home page - Sledilne naprave - Sledenje avtomobila     GPS tracker vehicle locator - up to 100 days tracking     PR208GPS     2656     SKU Code: PR208GPS     User Code: 2656     Quality GPS locator for cars with high sensitivity and endurance up to 100 days. Online map background with history storage + Android phones application for free lifetime     InStock     Price 247,00 \u20ac     HOW A GPS LOCATOR WORKS     The GPS locator is able to determine its position using a sensitive GPS module. The detected location can then be sent to you via SMS message or sent to a server, where you can monitor not only the current location, but also the complete history of movement.     In order for the locator to be able to communicate remotely, it is necessary to insert a SIM card with a charged credit (with an activated data plan if you want to use monitoring via a web server or smartphone application).     USE OF LOCATOR     Thanks to its very long endurance, the locator is suitable for use mainly for tracking passenger cars. However, its dimensions are not huge, so you can place it in a child's backpack, for example, to control the movement of your child. The locator is equipped with an SOS button that your child can press in case of a problem, and you will be informed immediately.     Consumption while moving     50mA     ENDURANCE UP TO 100 DAYS     The GPS locator is equipped with a high-capacity battery, thanks to which it will last up to 100 days in operation.     SENSITIVE GPS RECEIVER     Thanks to the sensitive GPS receiver, the locator is able to reliably determine the position with an accuracy of a few meters. At the same time, it is able to update its location a few seconds after waking up from sleep mode.     TRACKING VIA MOBILE APPLICATION     Tracking with a mobile application is simple and efficient. The application allows you to view the current location, as well as the history of movement in the selected interval. The application is compatible with Android.     SMS NOTIFICATION WHEN THE BATTERY IS LOW     You will be informed about the low battery status in time via an SMS message.     LOW CONSUMPTION DUE TO SHOCK SENSOR     If the locator does not detect movement for more than 5 minutes, it will automatically go into power saving mode, in which it consumes only 2mA. As soon as the car starts moving again, the shock sensor ensures that the locator wakes up again.     WARNING WHEN MOVING     This feature ensures that you are notified immediately when your vehicle starts moving.     GEO FENCE     Allows you to set allowed or prohibited sites where the locator may \/ may not occur. You will receive an SMS notification when entering or exiting the set zone.     REMOTE EAVESDROPPING     The GPS locator is equipped with a microphone, thanks to which it allows you to listen to its surroundings. Just call the SIM card number inside the locator from your mobile phone, and you can listen immediately. Of course, the locator does not ring and answers the call automatically.

      "text":" Introduction     Short introduction     The meteorology group at the Department of Physics,Faculty of Mathematics and Physics (FMF) of the University of Ljubljana carries out meteorology education and training on all three levels of education (BSc, MSc, PhD). It is the only meteorology study program in Slovenia. Beside education of future meteorologists at FMF, meteorology lectures for students of other programs which need basic knowledge of meteorology within the University of Ljubljana are carried out. Examples of external lectures are aviation meteorology at the Faculty of Engineering and Hydrology and the Faculty of Civil Engineering. More about studies. Department of Meteorology has been also performing a lot of research work in major areas of meteorology. More on research work at Department of Meteorology.     History     Immediately after the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy the University of Ljubljana was established, and within also the Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics, which had continued measurements and observations on the Slovenian territory of the former Yugoslavia. After some lectures from the climatology at the very beginning of the University in 1934 the meteorological study was started thanks to professor dr. Oskar Rey. In 1949 first Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics was developed from the Faculty of Arts, and five years later the Faculty of Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Arts (PMFF) was formed. After the construction works were concluded the Department of Meteorology and some other sections of PMFF had moved into the new building of the current Faculty of Arts, on A\u0161ker\u010deva Street. By combining the Engineering Faculty and the part of PMFF in 1960 the Faculty of Science and Technology was formed. In 1995, the division of the Faculty of Science and Technology leaded to foundation of the Faculty Mathematics and Physics (FMF), containing the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics and Department of Physics, which also included the Meteorology group. For many years, the head of group was Professor Dr. Zdravko Petkov\u0161ek, who has been followed by professor. Dr. Jo\u017ee Rakovec. When the extension to the FMF building (Jadranska Street 19) was made In 2005, the group as well as Meteorological Library (the only of that kind in Slovenia) were moved to the new location on Jadranska Street 19. After World War II, the operational meteorology was passed over from Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics to the newly established meteorological department. The meteorological program at the University was reformed in such a way that since then the meteorological processes has been explained by using physics and mathematical tools. From 1953 until today somewhere over a hundred students has completed such a studying program. Less than half of them work in the civil service \u2013 mostly of those in the Bureau of Meteorology, Environmental Agency, about a quarter of them at the University or institutes and the rest elsewhere. After the transformation of studying program following \u201cBologna\" method in 2009 the first degree of program slightly extended in an independent first-degree studying program, called Meteorology with Geophysics. On the second-degree studying program the inter-faculty Geophysics study program is performed which contains a meteorological module. Research work, which occasionally includes students, has also produced 15 masters and 11 doctors of science in the field of meteorology. The professors from FMF also teach meteorological material on FF, FGG, FS and V\u0160Z. The BF is dealing with meteorology too, especially with the agro meteorology and climatology, and therefore it has been participated in the study of meteorology at the FMF.     Cooperation with the Meteorological office of EARS     For many years now the meteorology group has been successfully cooperating with the Meteorological office of the Environmental agency of the Republic of Slovenia (EARS). Even from the very nature of weather processes and formations, which are of continental dimensions, it is clear that research in meteorology is also embedded in international connections. The result, probably best known to public, of such international cooperation of Slovenian meteorologists from the University of Ljubljana and from the EARS, is the development of weather prediction model ALADIN. In EARS, it is used operationally and these results, publicly available, are the basis for regionally detailed specificities of daily weather forecasts. The cooperation between the meteorology group and the EARS extends to other fields as well. The current project includes the development of operational tools for modeling diffusion of pollutants in the atmosphere. "

They can also be equipped with various accessories, such as flanges, rings, clamps, etc.     Structure of the heating cartridge     Brass or prochrome pipe with a diameter from 10 to 25 mm and length from 50 to 2000 mm surrounds and protects the heating helix, which is made of strongly alloyed wire resistive to high temperatures. The heating helix is set in the grooves of a steatite ceramic and surrounded by quartz sand.     Special features     The bore can be up to a maximum of 0,2 mm from the diameter of the heater, in order to ensure faultless operation.     How is the heating cartridge built?     A long-life ceramic body is inserted into a tube that withstands constant temperature fluctuation and boasts the best possible thermal conductivity. The resistive wire is installed inside the ceramic body and is of the highest quality. The Kanthal D heating wire is used for the production of heating inserts due to its high temperature tolerance. It is filled with verified granulometric magnesium oxide that covers the internal part of the heater, which ensures perfect conductivity between the heating wire and the heater. Elektromehanika Ho\u017ei\u010d produces insert heating cartridges of all designs. Heating cartridges are usually used for heating tools, heating of metal objects, and are usually inserted into bores. All heating cartridges are designed according to your requirements for closures, threads, plates, flanges, etc.     Heating cartridges with sensors     Heating cartridges with installed thermocouples may be equipped with the thermocouples of your choice. The latter facilitate monitoring and control of the heating process. Thermocouple types K (Ni CrNi) or J (Fe Co) may be installed. Heating cartridges are suitable for heating up to 350 \u00b0C and may be custom made for higher temperatures. Our heating cartridges are made of high quality stainless steel or brass pipes.     Orders     All of the main characteristics of a desired heater\/cartridge (voltage, power, diameter, length of the tube, length of the connection, for two-sided connections also whether wire or screw connection, data on rims) have to be specified in the order. Heaters have code numbers for ordering. The code contains all the information needed to make an order.     Note     Standard voltages are 110 V, 220 V and 380 V. The only limited parameter of the heater is its power.     Table of maximal allowed power of the heater depending on the length, voltage and diameter of the tube: *Table of maximal allowed power of the heater depending on the length, voltage and diameter of the tube     Example     You wish to order a heater: length 200 mm, diameter 18 mm, voltage 220 V, power 300 W. First take a careful look at the table below and see whether such heater is available, then decide about the length of the connection and write down the code number (0.220.300.18.200, l is 500 mm).     The wind has no influence     Heat is not taken away by the wind as with other heating methods.     Various sizes     We produce standard dimensional heater and heater according to your wishes and plans. "

Within the project, we will develop flexible approaches to learning that will be tested in the 7 participating countries.     OBJECTIVES     Development, pilot testing and evaluation of a concept for professional development of expert associates, which consists of three parts \u2013 manual for independent study, six modules for implementation of trainings and a roadmap for stakeholders.     Adaptation of the professional development concepts for transfer and use in the partner countries.     Dissemination of the new concept on the national and European level.     DESCRIPTION     In Europe, work-based training that combines vocational training with learning and acquisition of basic skills has become an innovative method for reaching less educated and low-skilled employees and improving their development of basic skills.     Read more     Various national and European projects and implemented strategies based on the innovative training concept use practice-based findings to emulate different ways to approach companies and employees, to learn and develop skills and competences at work and to describe organisational structures that encourage development in this area. It has been shown that for successful implementation of strategies for further education of less educated and low-skilled employed workers at work, the work-based training programmes must be professionally designed. In the scope of the PROFI TRAIN project, we will develop products for testing and evaluation of concepts for training and professional development of human resources.     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS     A Self-study Manual for work-based development of skills;     Six curricularly edited thematic training modules for direct implementation of seminars; and     Read more     European roadmap for stakeholders on the importance and methods of work-based training of basic skills for employees;     Project report and a professional article describing the situation and needs in partner countries (Professionalisation of work-based basic education);     Pilot test of the developed products in practice in all project partner countries.

The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.     Service Providers excluded from the provisions of ZPlaSSIED     In the Republic of Slovenia payment services are regulated by the Payment Services, Services of Issuing Electronic Money and Payment Systems Act (ZPlaSSIED - in Slovene). However, the ZPlaSSIED also provides exclusions, for which its provisions do not apply to.     Therefore, the ZPlaSSIED does not apply to the services based on specific payment instruments that can be used only in a limited way, that meet one of the following conditions:     i. instruments allowing the holder to acquire goods or services only in the premises of the issuer or within a limited network of service providers under direct commercial agreement with a professional issuer;     ii. instruments which can be used only to acquire a very limited range of goods or services;     iii. instruments valid only in the Republic of Slovenia provided at the request of an undertaking or a public sector entity and regulated by a national or regional public authority for specific social or tax purposes to acquire specific goods or services from suppliers having a commercial agreement with the issuer.     Service providers carrying out either of the activities referred to in points (i) and (ii) (limited network exclusion), for which the total value of payment transactions executed over the preceding 12 months exceeds the amount of EUR 1 million, must send a notification to the Bank of Slovenia, containing a description of the services offered, specifying under which exclusion referred to in point (i) and (ii) the activity is considered to be carried out.     Simultaneously, the ZPlaSSIED does not apply to the payment transactions by a provider of electronic communications networks or services provided in addition to electronic communications services for a subscriber to the network or service:     i. for purchase of digital content and voice-based services, regardless of the device used for the purchase or consumption of the digital content and charged to the related bill, or     ii. performed from or via an electronic device and charged to the related bill within the framework of a charitable activity or for the purchase of tickets; provided that the value of any single payment transaction referred to in points (i) and (ii) does not exceed EUR 50 and:     the cumulative value of payment transactions for an individual subscriber does not exceed EUR 300 per month, or     where a subscriber pre-funds its account with the provider of the electronic communications network or service, the cumulative value of payment transactions does not exceed EUR 300 per month.     Service providers carrying out the abovementioned activities must send a notification to the Bank of Slovenia and provide an annual audit opinion, testifying that the activity complies with the limits set out in the ZPlaSSIED.

Collection description: About 6000 earlier manuscript music works survived in the territory of the present-day Slovenia. These, together with a number of extant earlier music prints, now form the general fund of the national early music heritage in Slovenia. Old music manuscripts stored in archives at various locations throughout the area of Slovenia were first inventorised at the Institute of Musicology in the form of a loose-leaf catalogue, containing around 1500 units. In 1993 the Institute joined the international documentation-musicology project RISM (R\u00e9pertoire international des sources musicales), based in Frankfurt-am-Main, which collects and presents such kinds of materials on an international basis within the series A I (Music Prints before 1800) and A II (Music Manuscripts 1600\u20131850). For this purpose a regional committee of RISM (the regional group for the inventory of manuscripts, seated at the Institute of Musicology) was founded in 1993 for the Republic of Slovenia. Since then the members of the Institute have continued to catalogue these materials within the most up-to date computer systems, and supplement documentation with additional contents. The results of the RISM project are accessible online: http:\/\/opac.rism.info. The work for RISM has no special financing and is performed as part of the infrastructure programme of the Institute of Musicology, as part of projects and program, and is at times supported by state and municipal grants.

It involves analysing, planning and developing the necessary changes in the system. To this end, the majority of work was performed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and the C# programming language. Moreover, the thesis presents other tools, technologies and methods that contributed to the renovation and upgrading of the system. The Islamic Community opted for the renovation because they encountered difficulties in the existing system. They were also interested in raising the level of data security, add new functionalities and introduce a mobile application. The thesis provides a detailed insight into the first renovation phase, which includes the renovation of the system back-end and a section of system upgrade that is visible to the user.

Promotional year 2017\/18.     present in India for more than 30 years     has guided few thousand people during India trips     author of two bestsellers     first president of the Slovenian Sai Organisation     master of the Enlightenment Intensive, Mind Clearing Therapist     Testimonials of a few of our fellow travellers:     Andrej \u0160ifrer, musician:     India is no longer never-never land but a rainbow of images, impressions and a country where the impossible plants a kiss on reality. Visiting it with a \"leader\" such as Boyan, it also opens up a dimension that I had failed to recognise during my previous trips all over the world.     Boris Vene, entrepreneur and author of the bestseller \"From the Millionaire's Diary \u2026'':     India has granted me a new horizon and physical proof of higher awareness.     Tone Vorina:     This land of affectionate and peaceful people has provided me with faith and purpose of life.     Programmes 2020     A few exclusive programmes commonly known as \u201cDiscover India (and your-Self) by Boyan\u201d have been drawn up. A comprehensive approach that combines theory and practice, facilitating a hands-on experience of the country, brings about a lot of practical knowledge and interior fulfilment. Lectures, exercises, meditations and hands-on work on yourself bring meaning to words and feelings such as energy, aura, ayurveda, yoga, chakras, mysticism, miracles, enlightenment, karma, divine love, etc.     India is not a tourism country in the traditional sense of the word where one would travel to visit cultural sights and have fun. India needs to be properly experienced, its rich history and spiritual values going far beyond anything the human mind could possibly imagine. When you surrender to the Indian rhythm and customs so far away from your usual environment and let go of all worries, responsibilities and roles you play back at home, you start to discover yourself from within, awakening your essence, your truth that suddenly oozes onto the surface as a powerful force, supporting you on your way to important discoveries and answers. This is also one of the main reasons for such a sheer number of people from all over the globe who keep on returning.     Having visited it more than 70 times, I have gained a lot of experience in my passion, love and inspiration. You will be attended to devotedly and whole-heartedly by my friends from the Kompas travel agency. You will get to visit various ashrams, palaces, temples and churces, rest on exquisite sand beaches, ride an elephant, become acquainted with rich Indian cuisine, history, various cultures and religious, all in all, the trip will provide you with a great variety, excitement and educational value. And, last but not least \u2013 by far, India is not merely the Taj Mahal, but also a land of antique wisdom personified by jogis, sages, saints and avatars. Experience India in its truest form. "

Even the finest guests will get excited when they see such splendid slippers.     Invite a friend to tea, dance alone in the living room, read your favorite book or magazine.     Yes, you will be happy to be home! ;)     Ursanina women's felt slippers are made of 100% woolen felt. Due to its unique natural characteristics, your feet will feel pleasantly calm in Ursanina women's felt slippers both in winter and in summer. They will not sweat because the wool breathes and radiates heat.     The soles are coated and do not slip.     Rubber can also be added to the sole.     Since the felt is a flexible material, the shoe is well formed on the leg after a few days of wearing. If you have a wider foot, we recommend selecting a larger number.     39 (8)     When the slippers get dusty, they should be slaked or stamped, and the harder dust is removed with an adhesive tape. How? Simply stick it over the seam, press well and peel off. Voila! The dust will be applied to the adhesive tape.     We do not brush our shoes (nor soles), as the fabric will crawl or tear.     Wash them in a washing machine, on a wool program at 30\u00b0C, with gentle wool detergent. Vacuum them before washing. Since wool slightly shrinks by washing, after washing insert bare feet to form their shape again. Then let them dry. We can also fill them with soft polybags to keep their shape. "

      "text":" KOR - Human Resources Development Competence Center in Toolmaking     The KOR project is focused on developing the key competences of toolmaking personnel and brings together 16 key sector enterprises. The partnership is based on the general awareness that sustainable development is most dependent on cooperation and human resources development.     Project description:     Toolmaking is one of the key strategic branches of the Slovenian economy. In fact without the appropriate industrial tools, it would be impossible to produce small, medium and large serial products. Slovenian tool shops in Europe and worldwide are recognized as one of the best suppliers of the most demanding tools and dies to global OEMs with.. Toolmaking is also essential for the operations of other production companies, since 80% of exports are also indirectly strengthening other areas of the economy. However, toolmaking is faced with a constant lack of human resources and development challenges.     The KOR project is focused on developing the key competences of toolmaking personnel and brings together 16 key sector enterprises. The partnership is based on the general awareness that sustainable development is most dependent on cooperation and human resources development.     The main objective of the partnership is to establish a generally useful competence model in which competences of the key employee profiles will be defined together with paths for their further development and acquirement of the new competences of the future. Further contributions of KOR will be implementation of numerous joint, internal and individual employee training with recognized Slovenian and foreign leading experts in the field of soft skills as well as in the specific technical fields. Trainings will include all key employee profiles: management (leadership), production managers, developers, technologists and tool makers, with a purpose of personal development, leadership competences and acquiring of new specific knowledge in the field of strategic directions of the branch, new development tools, technologies and Industry 4.0 guidelines.     The main goal of the partnership is to include 981 different people in training which in total will achieve at least 1283 inclusions by attending different training sessions.     In addition to the implementation of training, the objective of the successful implementation of the KOR project is to increase cooperation and recognition of the toolmaking sector and whilst at the same time establishing sustainable foundations for further support of the human resources development, innovation and development capacities. In order to multiply the effects of the project results and findings will be shared by all other sectorial enterprises and stakeholders from the other industries as well.     TECOS role:     TECOS is the financial and administrative project leader and assures high quality implementation of the technical, administrative and content activities for the whole partnership. Coordination includes content coordination, financial management, internal and external training coordination, active procurement of offers from external trainers, assuring high quality preparation and implementation of competence models, collaboration of enterprises and the promotion and representation of toolmakers\u2019 interests on both the national and the international level.     Sample Project     The client had to renew a wore down rotor with knife segments for which they didn't have any documentation. With precise 3D scanning of the original and creation of functional CAD model we provided them with data for production of replacement.     The customer has presumed problems with excessive warpage in the stage of tool design. The material is PA66 with 30% of glass fibers. With the help of advanced injection moulding analysis we predicted the trend and values of warpage and thus successfully eliminated the problems.     Our client has planned a single phase deep drawing process for the presented case, however several doubts about manufacturability arose. The conducted analysis has cleared all doubts.     We made a comparative study between experimentaly and numerically determined strength of a fibre reinforced product, which yielded extremely good match of the results from both methods. "

We also compared surgical outcome after minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) and conventional neck exploration (CNE).     Methods: Between April 2011 and April 2012, eight consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) underwent parathyroidectomy with IOPTH in our institution. Parathyroidectomy was defined as successful when a >50% decrease of IOPTH was observed 10 minutes after resection of the abnormal gland. The second criterion for success was a six month period of postoperative normocalcaemia.     Results: We performed four MIPs, two unilateral neck explorations, and two bilateral neck explorations, resulting in a total of seven solitary and one double adenomas. IOPTH level decrease expectations were met in all cases. The average length of surgery for MIP was 31 minutes, and 69 minutes for CNE. All patients were eucalcaemic with normal PTH levels during the 6 month follow\u2013up period. Three patients had postoperative hypocalcaemia after CNE and there were no recurrences 6 months postoperatively.     Conclusion: The review of our series of eight consecutive patients with PHP showed a 100% cure rate after employing IOPTH measurement in both surgical approaches. The advantages of MIP are: shorter operating time, better cosmetic results, and a lower incidence of hypocalcaemia. "

The most important part of IBS Newsletter is publishing of reviewed scientific, research, professional and popular articles that discuss themes like international business, sustainable development, organization, law, environmental economics and politics, marketing, research methods, management, corporate social responsibility and other topics.     IBS International Business School Ljubljana     All authors who would like to contribute to IBS Newsletter are invited to send their contributions to info@ibs.si.     Letnik 6, \u0161t. 3     Abstract There is an increasing emphasis on the necessity of a student-centred approach to teaching and learning. As a starting point, the paper provides a brief overview of the role and benefits of this approach, focusing mainly on foreign language learning. One of the key drivers of successful learning is motivation. Therefore, teachers should find ways how to make teaching and learning effective, and at the same time, motivating and enjoyable, always considering the needs of the students. The paper brings up certain strategies to inspire students so as to make them actively participate and involved in their own learning process.     Abstract This article intends to describe the most important characteristics of the student-centred learning and points out what students think about it. The paper first presents a short survey of relevant authors on student-centred learning and mentions especially its features in the learning process and assessment. It lists the most typical types of the student-centred learning and describes the new role of the teachers in this pedagogical approach. Seven students of the BA International Business describe good practices which they faced during their studies and show that students like this approach.

Abstract Lecturers at the School of Economics, Novo mesto, Higher Vocational College, strive for the highest quality of work with students. Introduction of new teaching methods should help provide them with knowledge that they will be able to use in their professional and private lives. One such method is the \"pro et contra\" debate. Lecturers in three first year study courses in the programme Economist decided to include our two-year project for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle into interdisciplinary teaching in the form of a debate. We formed three discussion statements on the importance of health for social welfare. The following debate statements were formed: - Concern for the employees\u2019 health is the responsibility of the company. - Multinationals determine the way of our nutrition. - Economic development is a prerequisite for social prosperity.     It was our objective that the students learn to project the knowledge they gained in economic subjects, onto the field of health and general social prosperity and to consolidate and broaden their knowledge. They should also get used to teamwork and independently and autonomously advocate their points of view. Students had to analyse different articles, write down the pros and cons of technological development and progress in general. The students were assigned the statement and their debating team by a draw. All debates were assessed by a panel of lecturers from various subject areas. They assessed the presentation of arguments, rebuttals and concluding statements and declared the winning team. The final evaluation, which was a guided self-reflection, showed that by preparing for the debate and with its implementation, the students learned more than they would in traditional lessons.     Keywords: interdisciplinary teaching, debate, debate statement "

In order to reach this goal, it is important to stress commander responsibility. But the commander can only have a perfect insight in the unit abilities if he knows where its weaknesses are and how to eliminate them. This paper represents the foundation for making a new metodology to check combat readiness of ground-based air-defense units. Criteria for the assessment and evaluation of skills are comparable to the allied regulations and standards. In addition, the results of the verification of combat readiness give the commander a comprehensive view of his unit's competence and can also be the basis for the planning of education and training. The main part of this task are the check lists at the end which represent a significant practical value and are a real indicator for combat readiness. "

Besides the well known pinch technics like composite curves and grand composite curve, the improved approach with the extended grand composite curve was implemented. The latter presents the most energy intensive units in the process separated from the process background as well as the direct transfer of enthalpy from hot utilities to cold utilities. Based on this presentation the synthesis of modified heat exchanger network was performed which results in considerable decrease of utilities demand.

Ve\u010d...     Opis: The thesis is comprised of three main categories. The first part of dissertation covers investigations of phase equilibria of compounds from natural materials in conventional and also non conventional supercritical fluids. In details, the impact of pressure and\/or temperature on the system behaviour (miscibility, solubility, phase inversion) is investigated, quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate and identify compounds contained after performing preliminary extraction experiments from different natural tissues are presented. The impact of operating parameters (pre-treatment of the raw material with SFE; different extraction solvents: propane, CO2, non conventional SCFs; different extraction temperatures and pressures) on extraction kinetics is observed. Following substances were taken into consideration: vanillins, caffeine, carnosoic acid extract and lecithin. Second part of dissertation covers studies of phase equilibria of the systems bio oil\/gas, which is crucial in biorefinery process design. In this part of dissertation, which covers studies of phase equilibria of binary and ternary systems, the impact of pressure and\/or temperature on the system behaviour (miscibility, solubility, phase inversion) for binary system bio oil\/supercritical fluid (bio oil\/CO2) and (bio oil\/H2) was studied. Additionally, phase behaviour of ternary systems of (bio oil\/diesel\/CO2) and (bio oil\/tail water\/CO2) under the impact of pressure and\/or temperature is observed. These data are of a high importance for bio refineries as an important part of necessary sustainable development. In recent years, studies on biodiesel synthesis have focused on development of process intensification technologies to resolve some of these issues. Fundamental data to design fractionation process of components of bio oil are crucial for an efficient hydrogenation process of bio oil. In the third part of dissertation observation of phase equilibria and determination of the parameters like diffusion coefficient, density and viscosity for the systems polymer\/CO2 at elevated pressures is investigated. An overview of different methods applied to determine the parameters like diffusion coefficient, density and viscosity of the systems polymer (PEG)\/CO2 at elevated pressures is offered. Observation of phase equilibria of the binary system PEG\/CO2, determination of the impact of pressure and\/or temperature on the system behaviour (miscibility, solubility, phase inversion), determination of thermodynamically and physically properties of the system with new applicative methods and finally, comparison of the results obtained by different methods is provided. The interfacial tension (IFT) at the (PEG)\/CO2 interface has been determined by using an experimental technique developed to study the interfacial interactions of the liquids in equilibrium with gas in a glass-windowed equilibrium cell by the means of Capillary Rise (CR) method. Advantages and disadvantages of methods that were applied are exposed and discussed. Klju\u010dne besede: phase equilibria, natural materials, conventional and non conventional supercritical fluids, extraction, bio oil, data for biorefinery process design, systems polymer (PEG)\/CO2, diffusion coefficient, density, viscosity, surface tension, Capillary Rise (CR) method. Objavljeno: 28.10.2014; Ogledov: 1768; Prenosov: 254 Celotno besedilo (4,46 MB)     Opis: An original measuring equipment and a system for investigating process parameters of the sewing operation structure and for establishing optimal working methods and real working conditions of the man-machine system in garment sewing are presented. The measuring equipment consists of a process parameter measuring and data storing system and a bi-plane video recording system. The measuring and data storage system is equipped with four sensors which measure the rotation speed of the main shaft, the movements of arms in the picking-up and laying-off zones, and the movements of the pedal regulator used to control the sewing dynamics. The bi-plane video recording system is used to record simultaneously the working movements (working methods) performed at the discussed workplace. From the process parameter measurements graphs for the technological operation structure are obtained, including the duration of individual suboperations and changes occuring due to pedal regulator movements. The bi-plane video recording system investigates the working method employed, the basic movements and and the optimal logical sets of movements, as well as the cyclograms of the movements used to define space and time values. The results obtained are compared with the MTM results, and the differences between them are presented. Klju\u010dne besede: textile industry, garment engineering, sewing operation structure, process parameters, bi-plane video recording, workplace design Objavljeno: 01.06.2012; Ogledov: 1557; Prenosov: 32 Povezava na celotno besedilo     Opis: Optimization problems for the design and synthesis of flexible chemical processes are often associated with highly discretized models. The ultimate goal of this work is to significantly reduce the set of uncertain parameter points used in these problems. To accomplish the task, an approach was developed for identifying the minimum set of critical points needed for flexible design. Critical points in this work represent those values of uncertain parameters that determine optimal overdesign of process, so that feasible operation is assured within the specified domain of uncertain parameters. The proposed approach identifies critical values of uncertain parameters a-priori by the separate maximization of each design variable, together with simultaneous optimization of the economic objective function. During this procedure, uncertain parameters are transformed into continuous variables. Three alternative methods are proposed within this approach: the formulation based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, the iterative two-level method, and the approximate one-level method. The identified critical points are then used for the discretization of infinite uncertain problems, in order to obtain the design with the optimum objective function and flexibility index at unity. All three methods can identify vertex or even nonvertex critical points, whose total number is less than or equal to the number of design variables, which represents a significant reduction in the problem's dimensionality. Some examples are presented illustrating the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach, as well as the role of the critical points in the optimization of design problems under uncertainty.

Experimental data of time-dependent kefir grain mass increase were used. The propagation was performed in RC1 batch reaction system under optimal bioprocess parameters (temperature, rotational frequency of stirrer, glucose mass concentration) using traditional cultivation in fresh, high-temperature, pasteurized whole fat cow's milk. We compared values of biological parameters obtained by applying the nonlinear regression of experimental data in logistic, Gompertz and Richards models. The most statistically appropriate model was determined using the seven statistical indicators. We established that the kefir grain biomass growth curve during batch propagation under optimal bioprocess conditions can be most successfully described using the Gompertz growth model.

Sistem bazira na inverterskem delovanju klimatske naprave, ki je v bistvu toplotna \u010drpalka in lahko greje ali ohlaja. Naprava kontrolira hitrost kompresorja glede na temperaturo, s \u010dimer je zagotovljeno optimalno delovanje in nizka poraba elektri\u010dne energije. Celoten sistem je nadgrajen \u0161e z rekuperacijo (odpadni zrak uporabimo za predgretje sve\u017eega zraka), kar je po dana\u0161njih standardih \u017ee kar zahteva pri gradnji proizvodnih objektov. Poleg izredno visokih izkoristkov v letnem in zimskem obdobju je nov sistem tudi nezahteven za vzdr\u017eevanje saj za njegovo delovanje ne potrebujemo nobene kotlovnice, \u010drpalk, vode, radijatorskih razvodov, ipd. Prvo enoto smo testno postavili v za\u010detku leta v proizvodnem objektu 1. Glede na leto\u0161nje vro\u010de poletje se je delovanje sistema v celoti izkazalo za u\u010dinkovito, zato bomo s projektom nadaljevali v jeseni tudi v ostalih proizvodnih objektih.

      "text":" The relation to what is being said and the circumstances of the spoken situation are expressed particularly through particles, which is why they are functionally very lively language components of everyday communication. With their semantic-contextual role they actualise what is worded and at the same time condense the message. The particle is one of those non-parts-of-speech that fulfils the textual role of the connector and is, more particularly, ranked among inter-predicate connectors or the connectors in supra-predicate texts. Since particles play primarily a textual role, they are also particularly meaningful words, which can be reasonably used in a text, especially in one\u2019s first language; they maintain a strong communicative (connective) role, and with this a well-marked role of influence. From the communicative-pragmatic perspective, particles are divided into two main categories, namely the connecting (text) particles resulting from pragmatic circumstances, and mood (interpersonal) particles resulting from communicative relationships. Mood particles focus either on the participants, the circumstances, the verbal process or the quantity, e.g. bogvaruj, kon\u010dno, dejansko, baje, nikar, while the connecting particles highlight textual coherence and cohesion, e.g. celo, kaj \u0161ele, druga\u010de, sicer pa, torej, etc.     The most comprehensive and functional semantic-circumstantial evaluation of particles can be found in lexical representation.

EngD thesis.     Abstract     The amount of data recorded in various computer systems is increasing rapidly, therefore it is important to know how to interpret and organize them correctly. With the increase of the quantity of data, the need for faster processing is increasing as well, since calculated final information is irrelevant if it is delivered to the final actor in the computer system too late. By the time of writing this diploma thesis, graphics processing units have developed to the point where they enable not only specialized computer graphics manipulation but also general-purpose data processing. The test includes tests of two different applications on two operating systems. The application of a travelling sales representative is presented as an example of a display of pure processing power of processors, and the two modules for geoinformation system as an example of a genuinely useful application.

Contents     History     Originally founded in 1972 as the Section of Art History at the Institute of History, this institution was renamed in 1975 as the France Stele Institute of Art History after its first head, the leading Slovene art historian of the time and academician Dr. France Stele (1886\u20131972). He was a pioneer of Slovene art heritage protection and a leading conservator of monuments formed his doctrine of protection under the influence of the Vienna School of Art History, Alois Riegl and his mentor Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.     Programme     Special studies are dedicated to the art of the Romanesque and Baroque periods and of the 19th century, and to the work of architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik. The results of the researches also contribute to the preservation of artistic monuments, which represent essential components of Slovene national identity. Special attention is paid to exceptional individuals such as Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, Toma\u017e Hren, and Francesco Robba.     Library and publications     The institute's library includes some 15,000 works relating to art history and is part of the ZRC-SAZU central library. Information on recent acquisitions is accessible through the COBISS computer system, and older publications are catalogued in alphabetical files. The institute has topographic and personal card files of Slovene art monuments and artists, and a collection of photographs and slides. These are constantly being expanded with new information and research findings. Research results are published as scientific papers in the institute's own journal and other periodicals and in monographs, with emphasis laid on Baroque sculpture and painting.     The central scientific publication of the institute is the annual Acta Historiae Artis Slovenica. Current reviews of publications, exhibitions, interviews with art historians and artists is published in the quarterly Art Chronicle Bulletin that was launched in 2003.     In 2013 the publication Le sang et le lait dans l\u2019imaginaire m\u00e9di\u00e9val [Blood and Milk in the Medieval Imagery] by Jure Miku\u017e was published online in French language (cf. link below).

      "text":" Memory Laws: Legal Regulation of Historical Interpretations     One-day workshop     Friday, 13 October 2017     Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (Institute of Culture and Memory Studies), Ljubljana     Abstract submission deadline: 15 May 2017     Notification of acceptance: 15 June 2017     More than a century after the Armenian genocide, it is still difficult to write about it, because one might be severely challenged: in Turkey, for insisting on presenting it as a policy of extermination; in France, for failing to do so. This is just one result of what Richard Evans and Henry Rousso call the \u201cjudicialization of history\u201d (Evans 2002; Rousso 2002). After the tide of legislation prohibiting denial of the Holocaust and other crimes, which peaked in the 1990s (Kahn 2004), it is time to evaluate the intended and unintended ramifications of its application and its potential effects on historical memory. In addition, the last twenty years have seen a rise in legislation that indirectly influences social memory by regulating the production, accessibility and dissemination of information about the past (Savelsberg & King 2007), the most prominent example being the laws that regulate access to archives.     The relationship between collective memory and law has been dominated by the paradigm of transitional justice and the debate on whether legal trials influence how societies remember crimes from the past (Osiel 2000; Douglas 2001). On the one hand, the discipline of transitional justice examines collective memory only in relation to the ideals of peace, reconciliation and dealing with the past (Barahona de Brito 2010). On the other hand, research on the example of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia demonstrated the limitations of the court\u2019s ability to shape collective memories in the region (Gordy 2013; Risti\u0107 2014). However, these issues do not exhaust all aspects of the relation between law and memory, leaving under-researched the phenomenon of \u201cmemory laws\u201d - any legal act regulating the interpretation of the past, whether by recognition, sanction or evaluation. This special issue invites more nuanced attention to be paid to the ability of legislation to determine the parameters of admissible and preferred historical accounts.     Memory laws are an important aspect of the state-sanctioned politics of memory, selecting and shaping interpretations of past events and promoting specific views of history in the form of both legal acts and their implementation in the courtroom. Furthermore, laws that seemingly do not fall within this category may actually act as memory laws (e.g. laws regulating veterans\u2019 pensions). Memory laws can even be abused for other purposes, such as eliminating the political opposition. Finally, national legislation related to historical memory, including governmental and parliamentary declarations and resolutions, is often shaped under the influence of international trends, or used as a tool in international relations. In this sense, international declarations, such as the European Parliament Resolution on European Conscience and Totalitarianism, not only influence the emergence of similar documents in national contexts, they also produce travelling concepts that are appropriated, transformed and used as arguments in political debates related to national memory cultures. This relation between the national and the international level is reciprocal, because it is often states that lobby for the acknowledgment of their past through an international declaration in the first place.     We welcome papers on topics related to the following:     - Legislation criminalizing genocide denial in local political contexts     - Use and\/or misuse of genocide-related legislation     - Recognition of genocide in third countries (e.g. the Armenian genocide in French, German and other contexts; third-country recognition of the Great Famine in Ukraine as a genocide or a crime against humanity)     - Political uses of the post-communist memory laws     - National appropriations of the European Parliament Resolution on European Conscience and Totalitarianism     - Historical revisionism through legislation     - Legal aspects of historical revisionism     - Laws on rehabilitation and restitution as memory laws     - Parliamentary declarations on remembrance from a transnational comparative perspective     - Theoretical contributions discussing the relation between memory and law     We especially welcome contributions that step outside the Eurocentric perspective and\/or approach transnational dimension.     Selected papers are will be published in a special issue of a renowned journal.     Organiser will provide affordable accommodation.     Please submit proposals for papers in the form of a 500-word abstract with a short biography to jovana@zrc-sazu.si AND jelena.dureinovic@geschichte.uni.giessen.de.

      "text":" Social Networking Management A social networking service is an online service, platform, or site that focuses on facilitating the building of social networks or social relations among people who, for example, share interests, activities, backgrounds, or real-life connections. A social network service consists of a representation of each user (often a profile), his\/her social links, and a variety of additional services. Most social network services are web-based and provide means for users to interact over the Internet, such as e-mail and instant messaging. Online community services are sometimes considered as a social network service, though in a broader sense, social network service usually means an individual-centered service whereas online community services are group-centered. Social networking sites allow users to share ideas, activities, events, and interests within their individual networks.     Since their introduction, social network sites (SNSs) such as MySpace, Facebook, Cyworld, and Bebo have attracted millions of users, many of whom have integrated these sites into their daily practices. As of this writing, there are hundreds of SNSs, with various technological affordances, supporting a wide range of interests and practices.     While their key technological features are fairly consistent, the cultures that emerge around SNSs are varied. Most sites support the maintenance of pre-existing social networks, but others help strangers connect based on shared interests, political views, or activities. Some sites cater to diverse audiences, while others attract people based on common language or shared racial, sexual, religious, or nationality-based identities. Sites also vary in the extent to which they incorporate new information and communication tools, such as mobile connectivity, blogging, and photo\/video-sharing. "

      "text":" Intelligent separation of interleaved sessions associated with building a data webhouse).     Marko Po\u017eenel (2010) Intelligent separation of interleaved sessions associated with building a data webhouse).. PhD thesis.     Abstract     In the past decades, World Wide Web (WWW) has become one of the main sources of information. The number of web sites and web pages is increasing, new applications and ways of web usage emerge. Companies need web sites to reach customers and sell their products, institutions furnish information about their services, individuals can effectively access various services over the Internet. However, companies with web presence need to make better use of opportunities offered by the web. Under the new circumstances customers can easily compare offers and choose favourable products and services. It is therefore difficult to attract new customers and retain the existing ones. It is evident that only those web sites that know their customers and understand the needs of their customers will prevail. Analysing users' behavior has become an important part of web page data analysis. Users' behavior analysis includes some more or less straightforward statistics, such as page access report, and some more sophisticated forms of analysis, such as finding the most common path through a web site. The main source of data for user behavior analysis is clickstream data that can be obtained from web server log files. For analysing clickstream data we often build data webhouses, where we encounter the problem of clickstream data quality. Clickstream data are often inadequately structured and show an incomplete picture of users' activity. For this reason, several preprocessing tasks have to be performed prior to loading the clickstream data to a data webhouse. The quality of the patterns discovered in data behavior analysis largely depends on the quality of the data in the data webhouse. The clickstream preprocessing process is often based on heuristic rules and assumptions about the site's usage and is therefore prone to errors. Many methods for clickstream preprocessing have been proposed, but reliable session reconstruction still remains a challenge. With the advent of new browser generations that offer tabbed browsing feature, the number of interleaved sessions has increased. An interleaved session is generated by a user who is concurrently browsing a web site in two or more web sessions (browser windows). In an interleaved session, temporal order of user clicks does not necessarily correspond to the sequence of browsed pages in a web session. Interleaved sessions have a negative effect on data analysis quality, so they must be separated. Interleaved sessions tend to be more often created by users important to us. In the thesis we deal with the problem of interleaved HTTP sessions. The goal of the thesis is to examine interleaved sessions and develop efficient methods for their separation so that we could provide quality data for data webhouse loading. To this end, we first consider the problem of separating interleaved sessions from a theoretical point of view. Then we describe characteristics of interleaved sessions and define theoretical background. In the central part of the thesis, we present two new separation methods: a method based on trained first-order Markov model and a method that uses recursive best-first heuristic search. The second method gives as a result the session separation with the highest probability of page sequences for the separated sessions. We evaluated both developed methods on experimental, artificially generated data and on two real-world clickstream data sources: the university student records information system e-\u0160tudent and the web shop EnaA. For evaluation we used several different criteria, which are based on symbol sequence similarity. The results clearly show that both methods adequately separate interleaved sessions. The method that uses best-first search gives better results. Both developed methods are general, so they can be used on any clickstream data source.     Item Type:     Thesis (PhD thesis)     Keywords:     HTTP session, data quality, clickstream, Markov model, stochastic model, user behavior, sessionization, RBFS, interleaved session, session separation process, data warehouse "

In: Video Analytics for Audience Measurement in Retail and Digital Signage, VAAM 2014, 24 August 2014, Stockholm.     Abstract     Audience adaptive digital signage is a new emerging tech- nology, where public broadcasting displays adapt their content to the audience demographic and temporal features. The collected audience measurement data can be used as a unique basis for statistical analysis of viewing patterns, interactive display applications and also for further research and observer modelling. Here, we use machine learning methods on real-world digital signage viewership data to predict consumer behav- iour in a retail environment, especially oriented towards the purchase decision process and the roles in purchasing situations. A case study is performed on data from a small retail shop where demographic and audience data of 1294 store customers were collected, manually verified and analysed. Among all customers, 246 store customers were involved in a buying process that resulted in an actual purchase. Comparison of different machine learning methods shows that by using support vector machines we can predict with 88.6 % classification accuracy whether a customer will actually make a purchase, which outperforms classification accuracy of a baseline (majority) classifier by 7.5%. A similar approach can also be used to predict the roles of an individual in the purchase decision process. We show that by extending the audience measurement dataset with additional heuristic features, the support vector machines classifier on average improves the classification accuracy of a baseline classifier by 15 %.

In a wonderful setting we bring up nostalgic memories through entertaining dramatic contents that show the life of our ancestors.     On the homestead, where we continue the tradition of our ancestors, you can observe in a quiet environment Scottish cattle grazing throughout the year throughout our valley. The area is extremely rich in water resources, and the farm even boasts its own spring. At the farm we also cultivate a vineyard, where we produce our own wine. You can taste it in our home wine cellar. Due to the immediate vicinity of the forest and tranquillity, deer can often be seen. In the vicinity you can take a walk along the marked wine route or go trekking on the Levstik trail from Litija to \u010cate\u017e. "

Za .cbr datoteke je potrebno nalo\u017eiti YACReader     Alan Ford je italijanski strip, ki sta ga ustvarila Max Bunker (Luciano Secchi) in Magnus (Roberto Raviola), natisnjen od leta 1969. Strip je satiri\u010dni prikaz klasi\u010dnih tajnih agentov, obremenjenih z nadrealisti\u010dnim in \u010drnim humorjem, ter sardonski sklicevanja na vidike sodobne italijanske in zahodne dru\u017ebe. (Wikipedija)     Zagor je glavni lik istoimenskega stripa, ustvarjenega po zamisli Sergia Bonnelija. Redno izhajajo\u010de knji\u017eice so svet ugledale leta 1961, gre pa za italijanski strip s kavbojsko tematiko. Dogajanje se odvija v Severni Ameriki okoli leta 1800. Zagorjev najbolj\u0161i prijatelj je zabavni Chico, Mehi\u010dan obilnej\u0161e postave. Pravo ime glavnega lika se glasi Patrick Wilding; Zagor Te Nej je le nadimek, ki pomeni duha s sekiro. Strip v Sloveniji izhaja v Srbskem jeziku, a je med pripadniki vseh na\u0161ih generacij eden najbolj priljubljenih italijanskih stripov. (Wikipedija)     Tex je bel mo\u0161ki v zgodnjih \u0161tiridesetih in poglavar plemena Navajo . Njegovo indijski ime je no\u010dna Eagle . Poglavar je postal, potem ko se je poro\u010dil z Lilith, h\u010derko vodje Rde\u010de pu\u0161\u010dice. Po smrti Rde\u010de pu\u0161\u010dice ga pleme Navajo izvoli za poglavarja. Texov najbolj\u0161i prijatelj, ki ga spremlja na skoraj vsaki pustolov\u0161\u010dini, je Kit Carson , starej\u0161i redar z indijskim imenom Silver Hair . Tu je \u0161e Texov sin iz zakona z Lilith, Kit Willer in indijski Tiger Jack. (Wikipedija)     Veliki Blek je stripovski junak, borec za neodvisnost Amerike, ki se pojavlja v istoimenskem stripu, delu skupine avtorjev pod psevdonimom EsseGesse, v katerm so bili striparji Giovanni Sinchetto, Dario Guzzon in Pietro Sartoris. V originalu je strip izdajala zalo\u017eni\u0161ka hi\u0161a Dardo, prvi\u010d pa je iz\u0161el 3. oktobra 1954. (Wikipedija)     Dejanje stripa se odvija v Severni Ameriki med ameri\u0161ko revolucijo (1775-1781). Poveljnik Mark je vodja skupine domoljubov, ki vodijo gverilsko vojno proti Angle\u017eem. Sede\u017e njihovega odporni\u0161kega gibanja je trdnjava na jezeru Ontario . Zato se Markova vojska imenuje volkovi iz Ontarija.

Sly & the Family Stone's debut, A Whole New Thing, didn't completely tip Sly's hand, but it got the ball rolling in the right direction by adding fuzzed-up guitar to soulful vocals, a tasty horn section, occasional protest lyrics and just enough Golden State psychedelia to make Sly's groundbreaking work unmistakable. This revolutionary new sound wouldn't fully catch the nation's fancy until the spring of 1968, but it was already perfectly clear that A Whole New Thing was going to be nothing less than what it proclaimed!

During power outages, however, any automatic door will cease to function if it has not been fitted with a battery pack to enable it to open or function in an emergency. In this case, your automatic door can be provided with mechanical unlocking using a robust Bowden cable, or, in the case of break-out installations, to allow the door leaves to swing open.

Bacteria and viruses are mainly transmitted through the hands. When the door handle turns into a germ spreader, this is a problem for companies, especially in the hygiene sector. On many everyday things like smartphones, shopping carts, light switches or door handles adhere to the unwelcome bacteria firmly. For hospitals, doctors\u2019 surgeries, restaurants as well as the food processing industry the touchless switch is the perfect solution. Are the hands occupied with carrying shopping bags, anything else or by typing a message on the smartphone, the approach to the switch is enough and and the automatic door open.     In addition to the simple operation of the door, the record BLS 60 is hygienic to use, as at no time the skin comes into contact with the object.     There are various reasons for considering the installation of floor rails. Primarily designed for challenging environments, it ensures record-typical characteristics throughout the operational life of your door system.     For automatic doors that are only rarely opened, we provide this simple push-button switch. Available as a surface mounted version complete with an additional housing, or as a flush fitting, concealed version for installation in all current mounting frames.     Protective door screens supplement our range of classic linear sliding doors. They serve primarily to protect the door from damage, but also prevent malfunctions, for example when items are carelessly placed in the path of the door.     Senzor record RIC 290 je opremljen je s kombinacijo detektorjev gibanja in prisotnosti, ki spro\u017eijo odpiranje in zapiranje avtomatskih vrat z visoko stopnjo varnosti in zanesljivosti.     The contactless IR hygienic button triggers an opening impulse without having to touch its surface.     Unlike the infrared sensors of the record 290 series, the detection field of this contactless switch is very small, so that it triggers only if a targeted movement occurs in its immediate vicinity. Inadvertent triggering is thus avoided, making the record contactless switch ideal for applications in hospitals, such as when entering the operating theatre after disinfecting the hands to perform surgical operations.     The record wireless button is a wireless 868.3 MHz radio-controlled button that can be attached to almost any point up to 30m from the door. Pushing the button transmits a radio signal with an embedded code to the receiving unit at the door control, triggering an opening impulse. Piezoelectric technology makes the record wireless button maintenance-free, and also means it does not require batteries. Included is also an adhesive film, which enables you to attach the radio-controlled button to glass, tiles or even painted walls. "

      "text":" Slovenian toolmaking was amongst those presented at the Moulding Expo trade fair 19:03:2019     The delegation of foreign journalists, representatives of various foreign and international tool-making associations and representatives of foreign tool-making companies saw presenting at the Moulding Expo, the largest toolmaking fair in Europe, as an overwhelming success. At the same time, the presentation enabled Slovenian toolmaking business opportunities, and thus built on the efforts of TECOS to promote the branch abroad.     Although this year\u2019s Moulding Expo, which will take place on 21st-24thMay in Stuttgart, will enable the presentation of around 700 exhibitors, its purpose is also to connect companies and toolmaking in Europe. In a message published by the organisers of the fair after the presentation of the exhibition in Slovenia, they highlight the connection within the profession; the fair combines and connects people and businesses, enables the exchange of experiences, dialogue, the search for common challenges, and integration in the development of new products, ideas or projects. TECOS Director Dr. Ale\u0161 Han\u010di\u010d, who during the presentation of the fair in Ljubljana, said: \"The fair is the most important industrial event for Slovenian tool manufacturers. With the support of the Public Agency SPIRIT, seven Slovene companies will also be exhibiting, and those who do not exhibit at the fair will attend as visitors.\u201dTECOS's participation in the presentation of the Moulding Expo also shows the importance of the Slovenian tooling industry on a European scale.     Dr. Peter Wostner, Head of the Department for Coordination of Smart Specialisation at the Government Office for Development and European Cohesion Policy, stressed during the presentation of the Slovenian strategy of smart specialisation that Slovenia is aware of the exceptional importance of digitising its own industry. We also commit ourselves to this at TECOS. Therefore, when visiting foreign journalists, representatives of associations and companies, special attention was given to opportunities for business networking of Slovenian toolmakers with foreign guests and presentation of the sector in the field. Successful B2B meetings were followed by three tours of Slovenian tool shops, where Emo Toolkit, Gorenje Orodjarna, Bizjan Toolkit, Kolektor Orodjarna, Sibo Group, LTH Castings and TECOS were presented to the groups. Both the organisers of Moulding Expo and participants were impressed by the visits and by the flawless organisation which was also earned us a special trophy.     A successful presentation at the Moulding Expo will also be followed by his visit.     You can find photos from the foreign delegation visiting the Moulding Expo below. "

This was of much importance in a mostly \"german\" city of Maribor. Beginnings were hard, but Slovenians managed and Branik is today one of the most important sports club in Slovenia. "

In addition, he composed music for directors and choreographers, such as Peter Greenaway, Bob Wilson, Peter Stein, John Turturro, Karole Armitage and Carolyn Carlson.

'Frequencies': the frequency, i.e. the number of times that a response was selected, is displayed for answers for each variable.     'Crosstabs': these are contingency tables: first select the independent variable, then the dependent variable. The analysis of the overall results will be shown, and will establish if there is a correlation between the two variables or not.     'Multitables': this is a multi-dimensional table of categorical variables. You can select multiple variables and the table will show the total results.     'Means': this option allows you to generate calculations of averages by groups. First you select the independent variable, i.e. label it as a category, and then select the dependent variable.     'T-test': allows you to verify the assumptions of statistical differences for two variables.     'Break': the analysis is broken based on the control variable. Select the variable by which you would like to break your information from the drop-down list.     For each analysis the results can be exported to PDF, MS Word and MS Excel formats. You can also create a link that you forward to selected individuals to give them an insight into these results\/analysis, but this does not mean that they have access to your survey. Each table or chart can also be included in 'Custom Reports'. "

Field Frequency Flux is site specific radio art composition, transmitted on local FM radio frequency \u2013 Radio VFM 94.6FM with live in-situ FM interventions. Performance experience is based on walking and in the same time in-situ listening to FM radio broadcast and surroundings sounds. program: Invisible Places \/ Sounding Cities     Field Frequency Flux explores and initiates sound, spatial and experiential situations in the face of a diverse urban natural ambience. The venue of the performance, created based on sound-walks, Field Frequency Flux presents a park as a space where to withdraw from the city\u2019s hustle and bustle, overfilled with information, communication and other stimuli that pull us away from listening     In the park, one enters the silence and emptiness of a night. He is equipped with a radio receiver that translates and catches remote electromagnetic sound contents. During the walk, the intercepted messages merge with the sounds of the sleeping nature outside the urban area, which brings an individual toward an organic, earthly sound that contains a syntax very different from everyday language. In this intersection space, full of distant electromagnetic contents and atmospheric sounds of nature, a space for fantasy and for working with memories emerges, which brings about an original and intense experience. Field Frequency Flux is based on everyday activity of walking and everyday sounds, which we often ignore because of an increased noise pollution and our daily routines. Through these unpretentious actions, a spectator is transformed into a \u2018composer\u2019 and \u2018visual artist\u2019 who reads and composes sound and space images. Field Frequency Flux is an intervention in the \u201cphysiology\u201d of a park as a specific, almost utopian space in the urban landscape.     concept of performance: Brane Zorman and Irena Pivka sound composition: Brane Zorman space: Irena Pivka text: Jasmina Zalo\u017enik production: CONA institute for contemporary arts processing, Slovenia (2014)     special thanks to Radio VFM     This entry was posted in 1\/radioCona, 4\/Sound & Music, 5\/Cona.

The basis for his research were the games from tournament practice and Ivan goes through them with a conclusion about the best setup for White.     - The attention of GM Milos Perunovic was caught by the variation in the Sicilian Defence after 1.e4 c5, 2.Nf3 d6, 3.Nc3 Nf6, 4.e5!?, that was once again brought to life by Azerbaijani GM Rauf Mamedov.     - The best Montenegro player, GM Nikola Djukic shares an opening review of the 3\u2026Qd8 Scandinavian, which served him well in many games he played over the past years, where even Magnus Carlsen could not claim any advantage as White, but instead adopted it as Black vs Fabiano Caruana.     - IM Goran Arsovic is an expert for the Najdorf Sicilian, as he has been playing this variation with black pieces since his youth days. His permanent work as a member of Chess Informant\u2019s Editorial Board keeps him constantly well-informed about any novelties in his pet line. Goran presents a new trend that has recently hit even the world\u2019s elite players, referring to 6.a3 and 6.h4 - attempts to explore new territories of this complex opening.     - GM Danilo Milanovic invites readers to follow his research on the latest trend of meeting Anti-Gruenfeld with the move 3\u2026Nh5. This fresh variation with lots of possibilities for both sides, leads to very much original positions and this is the reason that younger generations gladly choose it rather then some more explored options for Black.     - National individual championships of Serbia and Croatia were enriched with fighting chess. GM Branko Tadic and IM Srdjan Sale present their overviews of these tournaments sharing the most interesting games, theoretical novelties, combinations and endings.     - Best of Chess Informant highlights the creativity of the most prominent chess players.

More information about the cookies can be checked in the table bellow:     Cookie name     Purpose     Duration     The infrastructure group     The Infrastructure group provides direct support to the Program Group, which performs ZAG's combined research program. The research program is interdisciplinary, so that direct connections and well-coordinated work of the research infrastructure is of key importance for the performance of research. The research work foreseen by the program usually combines research into the behaviour of materials with research into the behaviour of structures. In this case the effects and loadings are not just static and dynamic loadings, but also consist of chemical and other effects, including those due to fire and various environmental factors. Infrastructural activities, including all equipment assemblies, are essential in the case of applied research for industrial partners, which result in either improvements in production, or the development of new products. The infrastructure group also provides important support when attempting to find solutions to faults in products which occur during different stages of production, and when monitoring industrial processes. In this way leading Slovenian enterprises from the field of building and civil engineering, and the vehicle production industry, can, with ZAG's support, more easily obtain corresponding certificates of conformity, as well as European and Slovenian Technical Approvals. This is because most of the results obtained in ZAG's laboratories are recognized, due to ZAG's high reputation, by notified bodies in other European countries, even when the national technical specifications of these countries are involved.     In the above-mentioned segment the following of ZAG's activities are of particular importance:     metrological work: calibration of instruments;     research into the microstructure of materials;     mechanical, i.e. static and dynamic tests of structures and their elements;     fire tests (including the development of fumes);     geomechanical tests.     It should be emphasized that the high level of training of ZAG's personnel is of key importance for the best performance of tests, and for the interpretation of the results obtained. The results of tests performed at ZAG are thus frequently the basis for decisions made at some of the Republic of Slovenia's ministries, e.g. the Ministry of the Infrastructure, the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, the Ministry of Defence, and the Ministry of Culture, as well as the Slovenian Roads Agency, the Agency for Investments in the Public Railway Infrastructure, ARAO - the Agency for Radioactive Waste, the Agency for the Environment, inspection bodies, and other governmental bodies.

      "text":" Richard Tognetti     \"Richard Tognetti is one of the most characterful, incisive and impassioned violinists to be heard today.\" The Daily Telegraph (UK), 2006     Australian violinist and conductor Richard Tognetti has established an international reputation for his compelling performances and artistic individualism. He studied at the Sydney Conservatorium with Alice Waten and William Primrose, and at the Berne Conservatory (Switzerland) with Igor Ozim, where he was awarded the Tschumi Prize as the top graduate soloist in 1989. Later that year he returned to lead several performances of the ACO, and in November, he was appointed as Leader. He was subsequently appointed Artistic Director of the Orchestra.     Tognetti performs on period, modern and electric instruments. His numerous arrangements, compositions and transcriptions have expanded the chamber orchestra repertoire and have been performed throughout the world.     Highlights of his career as director, soloist or chamber music partner include the Salzburg Festival; the Sydney Festival (as conductor of Mozart\u2019s opera Mitridate); and appearances with the Handel & Haydn Society (Boston), Hong Kong Philharmonic, Tapiola Sinfonietta, Irish Chamber Orchestra and the Nordic Chamber Orchestra. He is currently Artistic Director of the Maribor Festival. The first festival under his leadership was held in September 2008 \u2013 it featured collaborations with European and Australian musicians and the European premiere of Luminous.     As a soloist, Richard Tognetti has appeared with the ACO on many occasions and with the major Australian Symphony Orchestras, including the Australian premiere of Ligeti\u2019s Violin Concerto with the Sydney Symphony in 1998. He has collaborated with colleagues from across various art forms and artistic styles, including Steven Isserlis, Pieter Wispelwey, Jack Thompson, Peter Garrett, Neil Finn, Tim Freedman and Paul Capsis, as well as photographer Bill Henson and poet\/cartoonist Michael Leunig. In 2003, Richard was co-composer of the score for Peter Weir\u2019s Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World; violin tutor for its star, Russell Crowe; and can also be heard performing on the award-winning soundtrack. In 2005, together with Michael Yezerski he co-composed the soundtrack to Tom Carroll\u2019s surf film Horrorscopes.     Alongside numerous recordings with the ACO, Richard Tognetti has recently recorded Bach\u2019s solo violin repertoire for ABC Classics. The unaccompanied sonatas and partitas were released in 2005 to critical acclaim and awarded the 2006 ARIA Award for Best Classical Album. The concertos were released in 2006 and awarded the 2007 ARIA for Best Classical Album. Future recordings include a set of Mozart concertante violin works and the Dvorak Violin Concerto for the BIS label.     A passionate advocate for music education, Tognetti established the ACO\u2019s Education and Emerging Artists programs in 2005 and toured regional Australia with a concert based on the inspiring documentary film, Musica Surfica (awarded the best feature at the New York Surf Film Festival).     Richard Tognetti holds honorary doctorates from three Australian universities and was made a National Living Treasure in 1999. He performs on a 1743 Guarneri del Ges\u00f9, made available exclusively to him by an anonymous Australian benefactor. "

OPIS PROJEKTA Utemeljitev projekta Utemeljitev projekta in prikaz problematike Struga reke Ljubljanice med Vrhniko in Ljubljano sodi zaradi \u0161tevil\u010dnosti, kvalitete in znanstvene izpovednosti najdb med najpomembnej\u0161a in hkrati najbolj ogro\u017eena arheolo\u0161ka najdi\u0161\u010da v Sloveniji. Za kulturni spomenik dr\u017eavnega pomena je razgla\u0161en vodni tok reke Ljubljanice in Male Ljubljanice z obre\u017eji od izvirov v Mo\u010dilniku in Retovju do razvodja Ljubljanice in Gruberjevega kanala na \u0160pici v Ljubljani. Spomeniku pripada \u0161e del reke Ljubije na Vrhniki do soto\u010dja z Ljubljanico ter raz\u0161irjeno obmo\u010dje spomenika med Kaminom pri Bevkah in ledino Livada pri Podpe\u010di.Doslej je bilo v strugi Ljubljanice in njenih pritokih odkritih \u017ee preko 8000 predmetov iz razli\u010dnih \u010dasovnih obdobij. V bre\u017eino struge pri Verdu je \u0161e vedno ujeta edinstvena rimska tovorna ladja iz 1. stoletja. Skrivnostna reka in njeni nepojasnjeni pojavi so bili v preteklosti navdih \u0161tevilnim mitom in legendam, kot prepoznavna veduta pokrajine in mest je tudi pogost motiv umetni\u0161kih upodobitev. V obdobjih prvih poselitev je slu\u017eila predvsem za hitro in varno komunikacijo, po izgradnji cest in \u017eeleznice ter obse\u017ene urbanizacije pa je prevzela vlogo priro\u010dnega odpadnega kanala. Kulturni spomenik je trenutno najbolj ogro\u017een na obmo\u010dju Verda, kjer zaradi spodjedanja neutrjene bre\u017eine grozi uni\u010denje dvema ploviloma iz rimskega obdobja. Ker gre v obeh primerih za izjemno redke ostanke iz mo\u010dno degradiranih materialov arheolo\u0161kega mokrega lesa, ki se ohranijo izklju\u010dno v mokrem okolju, bi bila \u0161koda ob morebitnem uni\u010denju neprecenljiva. Za\u0161\u010dita tovrstnih spomenikov je zelo kompleksna, ve\u010dji problem pa predstavlja \u0161e velika dimenzija objektov in zahtevna podvodna dela. V neposredni bli\u017eini rimske ladje je bila odkrita tudi najstarej\u0161a lesena konica na svetu, stara okoli 40 000 let. Obmo\u010dje pore\u010dja Ljubljanice ima izjemen potencial na podro\u010dju kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine, dostopnost do nje pa je parcialna in premalo izkori\u0161\u010dena. Posamezne dejavnosti in projekti, ki so bili izvedeni v preteklem obdobju, so preve\u010d razpr\u0161eni in nepovezani. Prav tako je zaznati pomanjkanje dolgoro\u010dnih usmeritev, ki temeljijo na strokovnosti in temeljnem poslanstvu ohranjanja dedi\u0161\u010dine za bodo\u010de generacije ter kvalitetne prezentacije za lokalne prebivalce in turiste, ki bi posledi\u010dno pripomogle k razvoju regije in kvalitetnej\u0161emu \u017eivljenju lokalnih prebivalcev, hkrati pa bi spodbudile razvoj turisti\u010dne dejavnosti in drugih storitvenih dejavnosti. Trend zadnjega desetletja nakazuje obse\u017eno priseljevanje v ljubljanske primestne ob\u010dine z dnevnimi migracijami v prestolnico ter konstantno pove\u010devanje turisti\u010dnega obiska, ki pa je omejen na kratek obisk uveljavljenih turisti\u010dnih destinacij s prete\u017eno vodenimi skupinami. Prav pomanjkanje kompleksnej\u0161e ponudbe za razli\u010dne ciljne publike z mre\u017eenjem posameznih vsebin onemogo\u010da dalj\u0161e zadr\u017eevanje obiskovalcev na tem obmo\u010dju, novo nastala poselitev pa spreminja kraje z bogato tradicijo v spalna naselja prestolnice. Ozave\u0161\u010danje lokalne javnosti s posebnim poudarkom na vzgoji in izobra\u017eevanju ter kvalitetnemu pre\u017eivljanju prostega \u010dasa je zato predpogoj za krepitev identitete kraja, hkrati pa odpira nove mo\u017enosti za razvoj turizma ter o\u017eivljanja starih obrti in lokalnih tradicij. Omogo\u010da tudi kvalitetnej\u0161e varovanje in ohranjanje dedi\u0161\u010dine kot lastne vrednote in potenciala za bodo\u010de generacije. Prepoznavnost Vrhnike je danes razpr\u0161ena med ve\u010d tradicij, med katerimi izstopajo Argonavti (mit), Ivan Cankar (rojstni kraj pisatelja), izviri Ljubljanice (Bistra, Mo\u010dilnik) in industrializacija po drugi svetovni vojni (IUV, LIKO,..). Ljubljanica kot edini tovrstni spomenik naravne in kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine dr\u017eavnega pomena v Sloveniji, z edinstveno in \u0161iroko paleto potencialov (reka sedmerih imen, kra\u0161ki svet, Ljubljansko barje, podvodna arheologija, razvoj mesta skozi razli\u010dna zgodovinska obdobja kot posledica prehodnosti prostora in komunikacij po Ljubljanici,\u2026) je popolnoma zanemarjena, hkrati pa zdru\u017euje vse zgoraj omenjene podobe trenutne prepoznavnosti.Lega Vrhnike in njen potencial sta optimalna dejavnika za razvoj turizma v naj\u0161ir\u0161em pomenu besede: na sredini poti med dvema najbolj obiskanima turisti\u010dnima destinacijama (Postojnska jama in Ljubljana), vpeta med vse tri spomenike, ki so razgla\u0161eni na svetovni seznam dedi\u0161\u010dine UNESCO (\u0160kocjanske jame, Idrija, Ljubljansko barje \u2013 koli\u0161\u010da) in potencialom, da to postane tudi sama (Ljubljanica) ter obse\u017enimi infrastrukturnimi mo\u017enostmi za razvoj turizma ob glavni avtocestni povezavi s katerimi je omogo\u010dena tudi revitalizacija degradiranih obmo\u010dij, ki so posledica propada ve\u010djih industrijskih obratov in posledi\u010dno trajnostni razvoj kraja in \u0161ir\u0161ega zaledja. Za\u0161\u010dita dedi\u0161\u010dine brez revitalizacije, ki je usmerjena v sodobne in aktualne tokove vsakdanjega \u017eivljenja, je nesmiselna in vodi v nadaljnje propadanje, zato je upo\u0161tevanje dostopnosti do dedi\u0161\u010dine skozi razli\u010dne metode komuniciranja klju\u010dnega pomena pri prijavljenem projektu. Poseben poudarek je namenjen sinergiji naravne in kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine, ki predstavlja dodaten potencial za \u0161irjenje dostopnosti. Prispevek projekta k re\u0161evanju problematike Projekt obsega prvo fazo \u0161ir\u0161ega in celovitega projekta revitalizacije kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine Vrhnike, katerega temeljni cilj je varovanje, ohranjanje, prezentacijain maksimalna dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine z dolgoro\u010dnimi u\u010dinki na dru\u017ebeni in trajnostni razvoj v lokalnem, nacionalnem in svetovnem kontekstu ter kvalitetna ponudba za prebivalce kraja ter doma\u010de in tuje obiskovalce. S prijavljenim projektom re\u0161ujemo najbolj akutno ogro\u017eenost edinstvenega spomenika v Sloveniji, ki mu zaradi lege, stopnje degradacije in vrste materiala grozi uni\u010denje. Na podlagi rezultatov predhodnih arheolo\u0161kih raziskav in projekta za sanacijo desne bre\u017eine Ljubljanice bomo izvedli za\u0161\u010ditorimske ladje, ki se po kulturnovarstvenih smernicah ohranja in situ ter premestitev ostankov \u010dolna \u2013 deblaka, ki ga bomo dvignili iz ogro\u017eene lokacije ter za\u0161\u010ditili z aktivno konservacijo in mikroklimatsko komoro, kar bo poleg ohranjanja omogo\u010dilo tudi razstavljanje objekta. S sanacijo bre\u017eine bomo dolgoro\u010dno za\u0161\u010ditili kulturni spomenik v \u0161ir\u0161em obmo\u010dju, hkrati pa prepre\u010dili potencialno uni\u010denje rimske ladje in ekolo\u0161ko katastrofo ob mo\u017eni poru\u0161itvi bre\u017eine in izlitju vode iz enega od ribnikov opu\u0161\u010denih glinokopov na Verdu v Ljubljanico. Na podlagi testnih rezultatov bomo s pilotnim projektom rednega monitoringa, vzor\u010denja in analiz spremljali mikrobiolo\u0161ke in fizikalno-kemijske vplive okolja na rimsko ladjo v Ljubljanici in vzorce lesa v depozitoriju. Dobljeni rezultati bodo namenjeni spremljanju stanja rimske ladje in situ in ustvarjanju mo\u017enosti za trajno hranjenje najbolj ogro\u017eenih spomenikov iz mokrega lesa v depozitoriju ter pripravi standardov za upravljanje tovrstne dedi\u0161\u010dine. Poleg prioritetne za\u0161\u010dite najbolj ogro\u017eenega delaspomenika, bomo v projektu najve\u010djo pozornost namenili dostopnosti do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine, mre\u017eenju v \u0161ir\u0161em prostoru ter o\u017eivljanju degradiranih obmo\u010dij, ki poleg revitalizacije prina\u0161ajo \u0161e dodaten potencial za \u0161irjenje dejavnosti (razvoj turisti\u010dnih dejavnosti, kreativnih industrij, storitvenih dejavnosti,programov za robne in ranljive skupine, vzgojno in izobra\u017eevalno dejavnost za mlade in starej\u0161e, o\u017eivitev tradicionalnih obrti in nesnovne dedi\u0161\u010dine, znanstveno raziskovalno dejavnost ter posledi\u010dno omogo\u010dili gospodarski razvoj in nova delovna mesta). S tem bodo omogo\u010deni tudi pogoji za kvalitetnej\u0161e varovanje in ohranjanje kulturnega spomenika za bodo\u010de generacije. Do\u017eivljajsko razstavi\u0161\u010de Ljubljanica bo ume\u0161\u010deno v sredi\u0161\u010de Vrhnike, saj neposredna lokacija kulturnega spomenika ni primerna (reka, naravovarstveno obmo\u010dje, infrastruktura) in ne omogo\u010da dostopnosti za naj\u0161ir\u0161o javnost. Objekt, ki je namenjen kulturnim in izobra\u017eevalnim programom, je \u017ee v fazi energetske sanacije, zato so stro\u0161ki izvedbe bistveno ni\u017eji in obsegajo izklju\u010dno vlaganje v prostor za potrebe razstave. Kompleksna vsebina razvoja vrhni\u0161kega prostora iz perspektive reke Ljubljanice bo predstavljena nivojsko in ve\u010dplastno za razli\u010dne ciljne publike. Poseben poudarek bo namenjen dinamiki ogleda (slika, zvok, taktili, interakcija, svetlobni in vodni efekti) in sodobnim muzeolo\u0161kim standardom. Izku\u0161nja obiskovalca bo ve\u010dplastna in abstraktno uokvirja tri svetove, ki jih definira prostor reke, kot nosilne gradnike razstave: svet spodaj (podvodni svet, podzemni svet krasa, prostor arheologije, prostor neznanega); svet gladine (nivo vmes, prehajanje iz enega sveta v drugega, ravnina\/tok vode - tok \u010dasa); svet zgoraj (svet ob reki, svet ljudi, svet znanega). Z izvedbo prijavljenega projekta se bomo bistveno pribli\u017eali zadanim ciljem celovitega projekta revitalizacije kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine: - Za\u0161\u010diten, obnovljen in kvalitetno upravljan edinstveni kulturni spomenik dr\u017eavnega pomena. - Prepoznavna celostna podoba spomenika, ki zagotavlja usmeritev v trajnostni razvoj in omogo\u010da izdelavo dolgoro\u010dnih strategij s podro\u010dja varovanja in ohranjanja kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter njihovo prezentacijo in popularizacijo za naj\u0161ir\u0161o doma\u010do in tujo javnost. - Pove\u010dana dostopnost do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter ustvarjen potencial za izobra\u017eevalne, vzgojne, prosto\u010dasne in turisti\u010dne dejavnosti, za razvoj kreativnih industrij, ohranjanje starih obrti in nesnovne dedi\u0161\u010dine ter s tem zvi\u0161ana kvaliteta \u017eivljenja v mestu in \u0161ir\u0161i regiji ter ustvarjena nova delovna mesta. - Vzpostavljena povezava med dvema najbolj obiskanima turisti\u010dnima destinacijama v Sloveniji (Postojna \u2013 Ljubljana) in omre\u017eene lokacije v pore\u010dju Ljubljanice s kvalitetno, interaktivno in do\u017eivljajsko to\u010dko v sredi\u0161\u010du Vrhnike. Dopolnjena ponudba prestolnice in omogo\u010deno dalj\u0161e bivanje turistovna Vrhniki. - Revitalizirano degradirano urbano obmo\u010dje, ki je zaradi razvojnih gibanj zapu\u0161\u010deno in zaostalo v razvoju. Z izvedbo projekta Do\u017eivljajsko razstavi\u0161\u010de Ljubljanica bomo ustvarili u\u010dinkovito platformo za realizacijo ostalih faz celovitega projekta v prihodnosti. Bilateralno sodelovanje z eno od partneric EGP smo na\u010drtovali z raziskovalci Norgesteknisk-naturvitenskapeligeuniversitet in NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet iz Norve\u0161ke, ki se v sklopu mednarodnega projekta RAAR (2003\u20132050) ukvarjajo z ohranjanjem in preme\u0161\u010danjem spomenikov iz mokrega lesa v morskem okolju. Zaradi kratkega prijavnega roka se \u017eal niso pozitivno odzvali. Ker prijavljen projekt na\u010drtuje zelo specifi\u010dne posege (delno pilotne tudi v svetovnem merilu), bi vsako drugo sodelovanje v tej fazi pomenilo zgolj formalnost, zato se zanj nismo odlo\u010dili. Cilji projekta Splo\u0161ni cilj projekta Kulturna dedi\u0161\u010dina obnovljena, restavrirana in za\u0161\u010ditena. Specifi\u010dni cilji Eden od specifi\u010dnih ciljev projekta je vzpostavitev sinergi\u010dnih u\u010dinkovin pove\u010dana dostopnost do kulturne in naravne dedi\u0161\u010dine kot celote. S tem bo omogo\u010dena ve\u010dja prepoznavnost dedi\u0161\u010dine \u0161ir\u0161e regije doma\u010dim in tujim obiskovalcem. Pore\u010dje Ljubljanice je javnosti manj znano predvsem v kra\u0161kem svetu (ponikalnica), nekoliko bolj znani so izviri na Mo\u010dilniku in Retovju. Bogato kulturno dedi\u0161\u010dino (UNESCO \u2013 koli\u0161\u010da, Nauportus, \u2026) dopolnjuje tudi naravna dedi\u0161\u010dina Ljubljanskega barja (Natura 2000, Krajinski park). Specifi\u010dni cilj predstavlja iskanje dolgoro\u010dnih re\u0161itev na podro\u010dju za\u0161\u010dite in ohranjanja dedi\u0161\u010dine iz mokrega lesa zmonitoringi in analizami mikrobiolo\u0161kih in fizikalno-kemijskih dejavnikov okolja. V projektu se poleg akutnega re\u0161evanja najbolj ogro\u017eene dedi\u0161\u010dine v strugi Ljubljanice vzpostavlja trajnostni sistem hranjenja v mokrem okolju (premestitev \/ depozitorij), ki bo bistveno pripomogel k ve\u010djim mo\u017enostim za dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine tudi bodo\u010dim generacijam. Specifi\u010dni cilj predstavlja tudi dostopnost do kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine, ki je bila pridobljena s postopkom abolicije in izvira iz struge Ljubljanice. Namen abolicije je bil poleg dokumentiranja in pravilnega hranjenja predmetov, tudi \u010dim hitrej\u0161a dostopnost do te dedi\u0161\u010dine. V do\u017eivljajskem razstavi\u0161\u010du bodo razstavljeni in interpretirani \u0161tevilni tovrstni predmeti. Ciljne skupine Vsi rezultati projekta so namenjeni naj\u0161ir\u0161i javnosti, z iskanjem dolgoro\u010dnih re\u0161itev pa \u017eelimo dose\u010di predvsem trajnostne u\u010dinke, ki bodo omogo\u010dili dostopnost do dedi\u0161\u010dine tudi bodo\u010dim generacijam. Ozave\u0161\u010danje lokalne javnosti je ena od temeljnih nalog projekta. Z vsebinami in programi, ki segajo v \u0161ir\u0161e obmo\u010dje pore\u010dja Ljubljanice ustvarjamo potencial za razvoj turizma in \u0161irjenje ciljnih publik. Osrednja informacijska to\u010dka z do\u017eivljajskim razstavi\u0161\u010dem je namenjena prevladujo\u010dim in robnim ciljnim publikam, ki jih \u017eelimo spodbuditi k aktivnemu sodelovanju in na\u010drtnemu razvijanju skupne odgovornosti za dedi\u0161\u010dino. S povezovanjem strokovnjakov in vklju\u010devanjem lai\u010dne javnosti ter mre\u017eenjem kakovostnih programov bomo vzpostavili izmenjavo znanja in spretnosti, vrednot in pogledov ter dolgoro\u010dno povezovanje v lokalnem, nacionalnem in mednarodnem prostoru. Z razli\u010dnimi metodami komuniciranja (interakcije, sodobne tehnologije, taktili, atraktivni vodni elementi, eksperimentalne delavnice, programi, dogodki) bomo nagovarjali posamezne starostne in interesne skupine. Posebna pozornost bo s prilagojeno opremo in aktivnim vklju\u010devanjem namenjena ranljivim skupinam in obiskovalcem s posebnimi potrebami. Rezultati za\u0161\u010dite spomenika in analiz bodo dostopne \u017ee v \u010dasu trajanja projekta tako strokovni kot tudi lai\u010dni javnosti.

BASIC INFORMATION Project title: Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site Project acronym: Ljubljanica Programme: EEA Financial Mechanism 2009-2014 Area of the call in Set B: Cultural Heritage 2. PROJECT SUMMARY Besides being natural attraction, the Ljubljanica River is also famous for itscultural heritage. The riverbed between Vrhnika and Ljubljana is classified as one of the most important of its kindin terms of abundance, quality and scientific value of the findings. But it is also one of the country\u2019s most endangered cultural monuments. There is a unique ancient Roman cargo ship dating from the 1st Centuy AD trapped near the village of Verd, threatened to be destroyed by the erosion. Through our project its most vulnerable parts shall not only be protected, but also expertly preserved and made available to a large audience. Our further objective is to allow a considerably easier access to the cultural heritage and natural attractions of the Ljubljanica River for the public. This interactive experience and exhibition site located in downtown Vrhnika has been designed to encourage the public, including vulnerable groups, to activelyparticipate in strengthening common responsibility for heritage and for developmentof tourism, creative industries, revival of old crafts and local traditions. The present scheme is here to create a network and synergies between both cultural and natural heritage preservation activities within the Ljubljanica basin. This project is about an efficient platform for a revitalisation of heritage in Vrhnika and the wider region. 3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Justification of the project Because of abundance, quality and scientific value of its findings, the Ljubljanica riverbed between Vrhnika and Ljubljana is classified as one the most important, but also the highest endangered archaeological sites in Slovenia. The water flow of both the Ljubljanica and Mala Ljubljanica Rivers from their sources at Mo\u010dilnik and Retovje, up to the Ljubljanica and Gruber\u2019s Channel watersheds at \u0160pica is declared cultural monument of national significance. Part of the Ljubija River (Vrhnika) and the area between Kamin, and the Livada fallow, are complementing this monument. So far more than 8000 ancient items have been found here. The unique ancient Roman cargo ship from the 1st century AD is still being trapped near Verd. The mysterious river and its unexplained phenomena have inspired many myths and legends in the past. It has also served as a frequent motif of art. Once primarily used as a means of communication, the river has assumed role of a convenient waste channel following the large-scale urbanisation. This monument is presently most endangered in the area around Verd. The erosion is threatening two ancient Roman vessels. Both are extremely rare residues of badly deteriorated materials - archaeological wet wood that can only be preserved in wet conditions. In case of their destruction the damage would be priceless. It is an extremely delicate and complex task to protect these findings. Their dimensions and the necessary underwater interventions present a major challenge. An additional finding has been discovered in their immediate vicinity: the world\u2019s oldest wooden tip of some 40 000 years. The area of the Ljubljanica basin has great potential in terms of cultural and natural heritage, which at the moment is under-exploited. Specific activities have so far been running too scattered and unrelated and in a lack of long-term orientation, based on expertise and fundamental mission to conserve heritage for future generations including public presentations, all contributing to an improved quality of life of local residents. Service sector and tourism would thereby be encouraged. Massive Immigration to Ljubljana\u2019s suburban has shown in the last decade, causing daily commuting to and from the Capital. Meanwhile, tourist visits are limited to daily trips by guided groups to the famous destinations. Due to the lack of a more complex and differently targeted offer by means of networking a prolonged stay of visitors in this area is prevented. Meanwhile the recent immigration trends are converting these places to the Capital\u2019s dormitories. Promoting quality leisure time and encouraging local community\u2019s awareness are of crucial importance for the area\u2019s identity. At the same time, these activities contribute to new opportunities for local tourism and revitalisation of old crafts and local traditions. It also enables a more efficient protection and preservation of heritage as own value and potential for future generations. Visibility of Vrhnika is suffering from being scattered among its various traditions, such as the Argonauts (myth), Ivan Cankar (writer\u2019s birthplace), the Ljubljanica sources (Bistra, Mo\u010dilnik) and post-World War II industry. Neglected is the Ljubljanica River as the country\u2019s only natural and cultural heritage monument of this type - despite its unique and rich potentials (River of seven names, Karst, Ljubljana Marshes, underwater archaeology, town\u2019s history, etc). are combined by the river. The position of Vrhnika is optimal for tourism in the broadest sense. Located right in the middle between two most frequently visited destinations (Postojna Cave and Ljubljana), and between the three monumental sites listed as world heritage by UNESCO (\u0160kocjan caves, Idrija, Ljubljana Marshes pile dwellings), thanks to the Ljubljanica River the town has great potential to become one by itself. Further great infrastructural opportunities come from its location near the main motorway link, also encouraging a sustainable development of the town including the hinterland, and, finally, revitalisation of areas heavily deteriorated. Protection of heritage without revitalisation focused on modern and current trends of everyday life is meaningless and may lead to further deterioration. Therefore, taking into consideration the accessibility of heritage through a variety of communication methods is crucial for the project. Special emphasis is placed on synergy between natural and cultural heritage as an additional potential for widening the access. Contribution of the project to solving the issue The project represents the first phase of a broader and integrated project of revitalization of cultural and natural heritage of Vrhnika. Its objective is to protect, preserve, and present the heritage, but also to provide maximum accessibility and thereby long-term effects on a sustainable social development in the local, national and global context - including quality offer for the local residents, domestic and international visitors. The project as applied has a mission to solve the most acute threat to the unique monument in Slovenia, threatened due to its location, degree of degradation and type of soil material. Based on the results of previous archaeological research work and the Project for the Rehabilitation of the Right Bank of the Ljubljanica River, we shall conduct both the preservation of the ancient Roman ship which -following the guidelines of cultural protection - shall remain in situand the relocation of the trunk boat residues. The latter shall be raised from its threatened location and protected by using special active conservation methods and microclimatic chamber, allowing the exhibition of the object in addition to its preservation. Through the rehabilitation of the bank, we intend to provide long-term protect to this culturalmonument within an extended area, but also to prevent the Roman ship from its possible destruction. An environmental disaster provoked by the possible collapse of the embankment and the escape of water from one of the ponds belonging to the abandoned clay pits located at Verd into the Ljubljanica shall thereby also be prevented. Based on testresults we shall conduct a pilotproject of regular monitoring, sampling and analyses to monitor microbiological, physical and chemical impact of the environment on the Roman ship both in the Ljubljanica and its wood samples stored in the depository. The results obtained shall be used to monitor the state of the ship in situand create the necessary conditions to preserve the most endangered items from wet wood stored in the depositoryand standards of managing heritage of this type. In addition to the priority of protecting the most threatened part of monument, great attention shall be placed on accessibility of our cultural and natural heritage to a large audience, networking within an extended area and revitalisation of deteriorated areas, bearing additional potential for expansion in terms of tourism, creative businesses, service sector, dedicated programs for marginal and vulnerable groups, educational contents for both young and elderly, revival of traditional crafts and intangible heritage, research and development. Providing an improved prospective of economic development and new employments shall lead to a considerably improved level of protection and preservation of the cultural monument for future generations. The Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site shall be placed right in the centre of Vrhnika, since the the monument\u2019s direct location is less suitable - location at river, within an environmentally protected areaposing infrastructural issues - and would allow a much lessee accessibility to great public. The premise intended for cultural and educational programs is already being subject to energy rehabilitation, so the implementation costs are expected to be much lower and only limited to the investment in the exhibition space. The complex content on the development of the Vrhnika area from the prospective of the Ljubljanica River shall be presented multi-level and multi-layered, adjusted to various target groups. Particular emphasis will be placed on the dynamics of visit (image, sound, clocking, interaction, light- and water-effects) and modern museum standards. The visitor\u2019s experience shall be provided multi-layered in shall in an abstract way framed by three worlds, defined by the river as carrier vehicle of the exhibition: the world below (underwater world, Karst underworld, space dedicated to archaeology, space dedicated to the unknown); the world on the surface (the level in-between, transition from one world to another, the plane \/ flow of the river - flow of the time); the world above (world on the river, world of the people, world of the known). The implementation of the project applied shall bring us much closer to the objectives of the Overall Project of Revitalisation of Cultural and Natural Heritage: - Protected, restored and managed unique quality cultural monument of national importance. - A distinctive comprehensive identity of the monument, which provides guidance on sustainable development and enables producing long-term strategies in the field of protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage as well as their presentation and popularisation for the broadest domestic and international audiences. - Improved access to cultural and natural heritage, potential for educational activities, leisure and tourism businesses, developing creative industries, preserving old crafts and intangible heritage as well as improving quality of life in the city and the wider region with new employments as a result. - Connection established between two of the most visited tourist destinations in Slovenia (Postojna - Ljubljana), networking between locations within the Ljubljanica basin with high quality, interactive and experiential focus point at Vrhnika. Improved offering capacities of the Capital allowing tourists to stay longer in Vrhnika. - Revitalised previously deteriorated urban area, abandoned and lagging behind due to unfavourable economic trends. By implementing of the Ljubljanica River Experience and Exhibition Site Projectan efficient platform shall be set-up as basis to achieve further phases of the Overall Project in the future. Bilateral collaboration with Norway, one of the EEA members, has been planned together with the researchers at the Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet in NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet, active in preservation and relocalion of wet-wood-monuments in maritime areas within the RAAR International Project (2003\u20132050). Due to the short application deadline they have unfortunately been unable to respond positively. Since very specific interventions are planned by the project applied (partly pilot projects on the global level), any other partnership would only be formality at this stage, which is why we haven\u2019t opted for such a solution. Objectives of the project General objectives of the project Cultural heritage restored, renovated and protected. Specific objectives One of the specific objectives of the project is to create synergy effects and increased access to cultural and natural heritage as a whole. This will enable greater visibility of the heritage of the wider region for both domestic and international visitors. The Ljubljanica is especially less known to the large public in the Karst area (disappearing underground stream), somehow better known are sources at Mo\u010dilnik and Retovje. The roich cultural heritage (UNESCO \u2013 pile dwellings, Nauportus, etc) are complemented by the natural heritageof the Ljubljana Marshes (Barje, Natura 2000, Nature Park). The specific objective is to find long-term solutions in the field of protection and conservation of heritage items from wet wood by continuous monitoring and analyses of microbiological, physical and chemical environmental elements. In addition to acute rescue of the most endangered heritage in the Ljubljanica Riverbed, the projectshall establish a sustainable system of storage in a wet environment (relocation \/ depository), contributing significantly to improved access options to heritage for future generations. The specific objective is also access to cultural heritage originating from the Ljubljanica riverbed and obtained by abolition. In addition to the documentation and proper storage of items the goal of abolition has been to allow quick access to the heritage. Numerous items of this type shall be exhibited and interpreted at the described Experience and Exhibition Site. Target groups All results of the project are aimed at the general public. It is mainly sustained effects what we are strive to achieve searching for long-term solutions focused access to the heritage of future generations. Raising awareness of the local community is one of the fundamental tasks of the project. The content and programs that concern the wider Ljubljanica area create the potential for tourism development and expansion of target audiences. Central information point with an adventurous Exhibition is intended to dominant edge groups and audience, targeted to be encouraged in sense of an active participation and to systematically develop a shared responsibility for heritage. By bringing together experts, integrating the lay public and by networking all those quality programs the exchange of knowledge and skills, values and attitudes as well as long-term integration of local, national and international arena shall be established. By following various methods of communication (interaction modern technologies, strokes, attractive aquatic features, experimental workshops, programs, events) each age and interest group shall fell addressed. By using customized programs and encouraging active involvement special attention will be paid to vulnerable groups and visitors with special needs. Results in terms of protection of monuments and analyses will be available to both the professional as well as the general public already during the project running.

      "text":" Car and van manufacturers meet CO2 emission targets for 2016     All car and van manufacturers met their carbon dioxide (CO2) specific emission targets in 2016, based on current European vehicle test rules, but they will need to continue their efforts to meet future agreed-to cuts. These are the findings of the latest report tracking progress on CO2 emission targets for new passenger cars and vans published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA).     The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

There were 291 pupils in grades 1-8, and school lasted from Monday to Saturday. Works on school continued so the official opening was on 23rd of May 1959. The school was named Boris Kidri\u010d Primary School.     Throughout the following years the school continued to grow \u2013 extensions were built to provide space for a kindergarten, a library, a staff room, a dining room with a kitchen, a small and a big gym, a swimming pool, playgrounds, as well as some additional classrooms.     The school changed its name into Primary School Savsko naselje in the Autumn of 1997. Today, it is a medium-sized, state-owned school with approximately 360 pupils in grades 1-9, and a staff of 40.     School Facilities     Primary School Savsko naselje shares facilities with a private kindergarten, each working independently.     There is one administrative office, where parents can enquire about school-related things. To help our pupils study and develop to their best potential the school offers the following facilities and services:     Classrooms: Grades from 1-5 have their own classrooms \u2013 each classroom is equipped with its own PC and internet access. Grades 6-9 have a home classroom, but they change classrooms for individual subjects. Each classroom has a PC with internet access, and a projector. Research & reading: Our library and reading room maintains around 10,000 books. There are also computers with internet connection where pupils can research topics that interest them or that are related to school projects. Science, Information Technology, Craft Classrooms: The school has two Science classrooms, a Computer classroom, and a Crafts classroom. Computer facilities include a 30-workstation computer laboratory with internet connection. Three classrooms also have an interactive board. Dedicated classrooms: There are also dedicated classrooms for language learning (English\/German\/Slovene\/Spanish), Social Studies (Geography\/History), Music, and Art. Sport: Pupils can do sports in two gymnasiums, an indoor swimming pool, and an outdoor all-weather playing area. Kitchen: We provide breakfast, mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks; as well serving hot lunchtime meals. Breakfast and mid-afternoon snacks are only available to pupils from grades 1-5 who are part of the morning and\/or afternoon care. Extra-curricular activities: An interesting programme of extra-curricular activities is offered at the beginning of each school year. Activities take place in the afternoon. Most are available at no extra cost, and they run until the end of May. Special services: The school also houses an educational psychologist, two professors of special and rehabilitation pedagogy, and one qualified social pedagogue.     Staff     Here at Primary School Savsko naselje we have a dedicated staff who strive for excellence for all our pupils. All members of our staff, be it the cleaning ladies, the cooks, the caretakers, the secretary, or the teachers, make sure that they put maximum effort into their work to ensure the pupils\u2019 well-being.     We hope that when pupils leave our school, they are leaving as knowledgeable, confident, open-minded, reflective, and caring pupils who have high aspirations for their own future and who have fond memories of the time they have spent here at Primary School Savsko naselje.     Projects     In addition to following the basic curriculum, we also try to broaden our pupils\u2019 knowledge, minds, and horizons, which is why we are involved in various projects. Some of them are conducted on a school level, some on a city level, some on a state level, and some are international. Here are a few:     International Cooperation with pupils from Austria     eTwinning     Bike-Track-Bike     Every year we have a contest Create an Original Christmas Tree, in which pupils (and their parents) create Christmas trees from recycled materials of their choice. At the end of the competition we organise an auction at our Christmas bazaar; the money we raise goes into the school fund and is spent on providing school material for less-privileged pupils.     Thirty of the most diligent readers are invited to our Night of Stories at the Library. It is a night full of activities \u2013 from playing in the swimming pool, participating in workshops, eating pancakes, to reading stories late into the night. It definitely is a night they remember for a long time.     Pupils with a desire to perform are also able to try their hands at it. They can join the school choir, or if their forte is acting, they can take part in the school\u2019s theatre club. They usually perform at various school receptions and celebrations, as well as on cultural marathon day which we have at our school.     In the school year 2012\/2013 we also created our own project called Diversity enriches us. Pupils at our school come from different cultures and nationalities, and we wanted to include all of them in this project, thus showing everyone that we are all the same. The pupils learnt a dance, and then performed it in flashmob style in the city centre:     In addition to experiential learning, which children experience at Music, P.E., Art lessons and ecology, we have recently also been trying to become a model school for developing, testing and promoting Science and Craft. Our efforts have been focused on networking with Jozef Stefan Institute, educational establishments such as Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Academy of Fine Arts and Design as well as various companies, which could help us provide our pupils with as much experiential learning at a young age as possible.     Within the project we cooperate with eight partner schools in Ljubljana, to which we transfer our own knowledge and experiences as well as involve them in collaborative actions.     Our school was also chosen to organise a cultural performance in honour of Chinese New Year on 8th of February, 2016. Our pupils performed a play based on the book Ferdinand Avgu\u0161tin Hallerstein \u2013 A Slovenian in the Forbidden City by Huiqin Wang.     You can see the whole performance, including the opening speeches by Danijela Volj\u010d (member of the Board of Confucius Institute in Slovenia), Xie Duquan ( Chinese director of Confucius Institute), Maja Makovec Bren\u010di\u010d (Minister of Education, Science and Sport) as well as H.E. Ye Hao (Ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Slovenia), here: "

      "text":" ARICH in a Nutshell     This page gives a general description of the Aerogel RICH detector and provides promotional images to be used in the Belle2 presentation.     General     The ARICH detector provides particle identification system for the Belle2 in the front-end endcap region. It's main objective is to provide good separation ( ) between kaons and pions in the full kinematical region of the experiment (about 0.5-4.0 GeV). This is of great importance not only for the reconstruction of decay modes but also for the efficiency of flavor tagging algorithms.     Principle of operation     ARICH relies on the relation between the emission angle of Cherenkov photons in a transparent medium and the charged particle velocity, (where n is the refractive index of the medium). Aerogel tiles are used as a radiator. In aerogel emitted photons then propagate through ~20 cm of an expansion volume and hit the photon detectors (HAPDs). For pions and kaons of equal momenta this is sketched bellow left. On the right, the Cherenkov angle vs. particle momentum is shown for pions and kaons. At 3.5 GeV the difference between the pion and kaon Cherenkov angle is ~30 mrad.     Novel Focusing configuration     To improve performance we use a little trick. From one point of view it is desirable to have as thick aerogel layer as possible, as this increases the number of emitted photons. On the other hand, thicker aerogel increases the uncertainty in the photon emission point, leading to worse reconstructed angle resolution. To overcome this difficulty we use two aerogel layers with different refraction indices, which are chosen so that the two rings, from the first and the second layer, overlap on the detector plane. In this way we almost double the number of photons, without significantly affecting angle resolution. The concept is sketched bellow, along with its confirmation from the beamtest data (reconstructed Cherenkov angle distribution is shown for the case of a single aerogel layer and for the case of two layers in focusing configuration. The number of photons is ~ the same, while the angle resolution is significantly improved in the second case).     Aerogel     As a radiator a silica aerogel is used. Aerogel is an amorphous, highly porous solid of silicon dioxide (SiO2), that is widely used as a Cherenkov radiator because of its tunable, intermediate refractive index and good optical transparency. In the ARICH the 3.5 m2 radiator plane is covered by two layers of wedge-shaped aerogel tiles of size 17 x 17 x 2 cm, where the refractive index of tiles in the first and the second layer is n_1 = 1.045 and n_2 = 1.055, respectively. The transmission length of n_1 tiles is ~45 mm and of n_2 tiles about 35 mm. All of tiles to be used were already produced and tested for optical properties. Below are some tile example photos, including the aluminum support frame mockup.     HAPD     As a photon detector a newly developed Hybrid Avalanche Photo Detector (HAPD) will be used (developed in joint effort of the Belle II collaboration and Hamamatsu Photonics). The principle of its operation is shown below. Incident photon is converted into photo-electron by a bi-alkali photo-cathode with peak quantum efficiency of ~30% at 400 nm.The electron is then accelerated in a vacuum tube with high electric field towards the segmented avalanche photo-diode (APD) with 144 pads of size 5.1 \u00d7 5.1 mm. APD is a photo-diode with the applied reverse bias voltage (~300 V), resulting in an internal amplification (avalanche gain) due to the impact ionization. In the HAPD the avalanche gain of the photo-diode is about 40 and the bombardment gain (due to the electron acceleration) is about 1700. Therefore, a detection of a signle photon results in an avalanche of about 60000 electrons. For the readout a dedicated high gain and low noise electronics was developed: a digitizer ASIC which consists of a preamplifier, a shaper and a comparator (SA02) is followed by an FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-6 XC6SLX45), where the hit information is recorded and communicated to further stages of the experiment data acquisition. On the right photo, HAPD with the attached front-end electronics board is shown.     Geometry configuration     In total ARICH consists of 420 HAPD modules arranged in seven concentric rings (r_in = 56cm, r_out = 114 cm) and of 2 \u00d7 124 aerogel tiles of wedge shape, as shown bellow. In order to maintain good performance also on the outer edge of the detector, where Cherenkov photons would miss the photo-sensitive area, 18 planar mirror plates are placed as shown and sketched bellow right.     Below left photo shows the current status of the detector construction. Very recently, one sixth of all HAPDs (70) were mounted on the detector aluminum support structure. The left two pictures show full ARICH geometry, implemented in the Geant4 detector simulation. On the right, simulation of 2 pion tracks (in blue) with 3.5 GeV hitting ARICH is shown (with green lines being Cherenkov photons).     Performance in beamtests     To test the performance of the designed ARICH we constructed a small prototype, with two consecutive aerogel tiles and six HAPD modules, arranged as in a part of actual detector layout. In the recent few years we have performed three beam tests, at KEK in 2009 (3 GeV electron beam), at CERN in 2011 (120 GeV hadron beam), and at DESY in 2013 (4-5 GeV\/c electron beam). Below the photo of the setup from 2013 beamtest is shown. The middle figure shows the accumulated distribution of reconstructed cherenkov angle, and its projection on \"theta\" angle is shown in the left plot. The single photon angle resolution is about 13 mrad and on average 9 photons per track are detected.     Performance in simulation (Geant4)     ARICH detector geometry and event reconstruction algorithm are implemented in the basf2 framework. Using the full Belle2 simulation we study the performance of ARICH in the full kinematic region by shooting 0.5 - 4.0 GeV pions and kaons from the interaction point. The obtained Cherenkov angle distributions of single photons from tracks with 3.5 GeV are shown below left. On average we detect 12 photons per track (middle plot) and their angle distribution is then used to calculate the likelihood of track belonging to a pion or kaon. The distribution of pion\/kaon likelihood difference for pion and kaon tracks is shown on the right plot. As desired, two well separated peaks are seen.     More technically, for each track hitting ARICH we calculate the likelihood for each charged particle hypothesis as: , where is the expected number of detected photons for id particle hypothesis, the sum runs over all pads (channels) that were hit in an event, and is the number of expected hits on the i-th pad with a hit, assuming the id-th particle hypothesis. Although it sounds complicated, it is just a comparison of the observed response (number of hits and their spatial distribution) with the response expected for a given hypothesis.     From the likelihood distributions at different momenta we produce the bottom left plot which shows the kaon indentification efficiency vs. kaon momentum, where at each momentum we allow only 2% of pion fake rate (2% of pions are identified as kaons). The bottom middle plot shows the separation between pion and kaon likelihood peaks in units of effective peak sigmas (assuming Gaussian peak shape) as a function of momentum. Next we also test the performance by simulation of physics events containing a pair of B mesons. For the pions and kaons from the decays that hit ARICH we obtain the separation as shown on the bottom right plot. Allowing 2% of pions to \"fake\" kaons we correctly identify 98% of kaons.     Simulation vs. beamtest comparison     Finally we compare the distributions of Cherenkov angle and number of photons\/track as obtained form simulation and from beamtest data. This is shown bellow. Note that here the number of photons\/track is much lower as nominally, as we exclude 2 edge rows of HAPD channels from the analysis (55% of HAPD surface). In the beamtest the distribution of photons on these edge channels is highly distorted due to distorted internal electric field in the HAPD. This effect is not present when the HAPD is operated in magnetic field, as will be in Belle II. "

The horizontal structure of the analysed managed stands is more diverse and patchy, the number of canopy gaps and stand initiation patches is higher, and their average area is larger, too. In the managed forest growing stock is lessthan half of that in the virgin forest remnant, the volume of large diameter trees (DBH>50 cm) and dead trees (snags and logs) is much lower, treespecies composition is more diverse and tree species number in natural regeneration is higher compared to the virgin forest remnant. The herb layer is more abundant in the managed forest: more plant species were registered there and their abundance is greater. In the cyclical stand in development from juvenile to optimal phase the number and abundance of plant species increased. Proportion of developmental phases is a suitable indicator for assessment of different criteria of sustainable forest management. "

      "text":" Graphic novel wins book of year award     Ljubljana, 1 December - An idiosyncratic graphic novel that was originally released in instalments on Facebook has won the Grand Prix for book of the year at the Slovenian Book Fair.     Ljubljana The poster for this year's Slovenian Book Fair. Photo: Cankarjev Dom     \"Vinjete Straholjubca\" (The B\u00eate Noire Vignettes) is a joint project by writer Eva Mahkovic and illustrator Eva Mlinar, and the first original Slovenian release by VigeVageKnjige, a publisher specialised in translations of comics and graphic novels.     Originally a series of short snippets posted on Facebook between 2011 and 2015, the project morphed into a loosely connected collage of horror stories that the publisher describes as \"an attempt to create a literary and visual collection of the grotesque of an elusive genre\".     The Book Fair jury, comprising literature lovers as well as industry professionals, described it as an \"intimate and provocative manifestation of a tangle of lucid ideas by two authors\".     The authors have created a rich fantastic world of their own, but they also draw profusely on sources including the Bible, William Shakespeare, Truman Capote and Umberto Eco.     The book is \"controlled down to the last detail, enhancing the reader's experience of encountering the emerging genre of the graphic novel,\" according to jury member Domen Fras, a graphic designer.     The award is not confined to any one genre, all books published between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019 were eligible. The works were judged as integral pieces of art, with the jury considering not just the stories but also layout, language, graphic design, illustration and photography.     The winner was selected by Slovenian Book Fair visitors from among a shortlist of five very diverse works which included a literarised tour guide of Istria, a poetry collection, and a collection of Facebook posts by Mahkovic, the only author with two shortlisted works.     Jury member Nina Ko\u017ear said the selection was accidentally heavy on books that were created on modern platforms: three started out on Facebook and one seems like it did.     The award was conferred on the last day of the 35th Slovenian Book Fair on Sunday. "

EngD thesis.     Abstract     In this thesis we wanted to present the project that was made for a smaller hotel in Nova Gorica. The goal was to create an application for managing access control according to customer's wishes as well as to introduce the system into the existent infrastructure. The first step was to define what access control actually means. In broad terms it is divided into RFID \u2013 radio-frequency identification and biometric identification. Both have their strengths and their weaknesses. Next step was choosing the right tools to develop the application for managing access control. We picked Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and Microsoft .NET framework using C# programming language. We analyzed the customer's requirements, defined the functional and non-functional requirements and set up a database. The most demanding part was of course developing the application, studying the hardware and how to communicate with it. We chose the hardware created by IDTECK, which has been at the forefront of manufacturing and developing access control hardware for more than 20 years. Their products are moderately priced and they provide software developers with the SDK development kit that allows the developers to upgrade their solutions according to customer's wishes. The thesis thus offers an overview of the development of an application for managing smart RFID card, made to suit the customer's wishes. We created an application that offers more than access control, enabling an overview of its users i.e. hotel guests as well as automatically disabling the users after a set date, which is something that access control hardware does not offer without a software solution. While researching various options we learned many details of access control and learned a lot about developing applications in Microsoft Visual Studio environment. In development we learned that there are many various other useful functions that access control allows, from calculating presence to timetables of working time and along with that an automatic calculation of the working hours.

It has organised various live cinema events under the title Kino-uho ('Cinema-ear') at the Slovenian Cinematheque, and has presented numerous other silent film music events featuring either orchestra, small band or piano at venues ranging from Kinodvor Cinema and Cankarjev dom Culture and Congress Centre to Klub Gromka. It has also organised numerous club meetings, educated musicians and audiences about silent film (starting a record label called SyHaPA Silents) and promoted silent film music in the media. Its invited guests have included Carl Davis, Gillian B Anderson, Alloy Orchestra, Neil Brand, Adrian Johnston, Blindman Kwartet (Brussels), Laboratorio di musica e immagine (Bologna), Phil Carli, Flower City Society Orchestra (Rochester, USA), Gary Lucas, Mark Dresser Trio, Anthony Coleman, Zeena, Sara, Margaret and Andrea Parkins, Janene Higgins Sakis Papadimitriou and Georgia Sylleou. SyHaPA has also commissioned numerous pieces of film music, including a score for clarinet (alternated with tenor saxophone) and piano written by composer Urban Koder (1995) to accompany the newly-discovered print of Ernst Lubitsch's comedy Als ich tot war (1916), and the music for The Passion of Joan of Arc (Tomaz Grom on solo double bass, also available on a SyHaPA Silents CD), A Man with a Movie Camera (by Tao G. Vrhovec Sambolec, for a small ensemble) and Pudovkin's Mother (by Zlatko Kau\u010di\u010d and the Pavel Vlasov Sextet). In 2004 a CD called In the Family Garden by Bratko Bibi\u010d & The Madleys (Fabrika 13) appeared as the latest addition to the SyHaPa Silents collection.

By clicking on the condition, an editor will appear, where you can select \u2018random groups\u2019 in the first drop-down menu and the number or patterns for which you wish to divide the questions. Lastly, you should determine for which group.     You should embed only those questions into each condition (IF) that you consider relevant, while certain questions should remain the same for all groups. These questions are not embedded into any of the conditions.     Random groups (sub-samples) are determined on the basis of the respondent\u2019s serial number and applies to the entire process of completing the survey. For example, if we have set four random sub-samples with two different questions, the first respondent belongs to the random sub-sample 1 with both the conditions, while the second respondent belongs to the random sub-sample 2, etc. "

      "text":" Fish That is High in Omega 3 Fatty Acids [List]     And there is no better thing than eating a wild fish that we caught by ourselves.     Different fish species have different content of nutrients which are beneficial for our health. One of those nutrients is Omega 3 fatty acids.     Here I am going to answer some common questions about Omega 3 and list you some of the tastiest fish that is high in Omega 3, in the following chapters:     What are Omega 3 Fatty Acids Good for?     Firstly, you have to know what exactly are omega 3 fatty acids.     There are three types of it, and two are present in seafood and fish.     Those are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The third one is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).     ALA can\u2019t be produced by our bodies so the only way to get it is from food.     When you consume food like flaxseed, you will get ALA. A small part of with can actually be converted into EPA and DHA, however, that amount is not enough.     The only way to get them in a sufficient amount is to consume fish or supplements.     Although supplements can deliver the required quantities, it is still better to eat a tasty fish, which will give you other necessary nutrients too.     These acids are a part of your cells. They are present in cells membranes. Your eyes and brain are especially sensitive to the lack of these acids. Every organ in your body is made of cells and that is why omega 3 are so important.     Omega 3 are good for energy too, and have a beneficial effect on your cardiovascular system.     Your lungs, endocrine system and immune system will also highly benefit from it.     The exact daily recommended intake has not been established by experts, except for ALA, but regular sea food consummation will provide you plenty.     Here are the most important benefits of Omega 3 Fatty Acids:     Cardiovascular system disease prevention     Your cardiovascular system will highly benefit from Omega 3.     Many people who eat unhealthy food containing a lot of fat, will have their triglyceride levels high. Regular consumption (at least 2 times a week according to the experts) of seafood rich in Omega 3 will help your body to establish normal triglyceride levels, and reduce the risk of developing different cardiovascular diseases.     Cognitive function improvement     When it comes to your brain, Omega 3 is beneficial for your cognitive functions and prevention of diseases like Alzheimer and dementia.     Omega 3 is not a magical cure, but it can reduce the chance you get some of these diseases, and if you do get them, to slower their progress.     Cancer prevention     Some preliminary research show that Omega 3 could lower the risk of cancer development, however, this has not been confirmed yet.     Same as with everything else, you should not exaggerate with seafood consumption. If you eat it few times a week, there is no need to take any supplements or increase the Omega 3 intake.     What Fish is High in Omega 3 Fatty Acids?     Fish that is high in Omega 3 will have all those positive effects on your body which were listed in the previous chapter.     If you are wondering what fish is high in Omega 3 fatty acids, and also among the healthiest fish to eat, here is a list:     Salmon     Salmon is very tasty, fatty, fish that almost everyone loves to eat.     You can cook it or eat it smoked, depending on your personal preference. Per one serving, salmon contains more than 3000 mg of Omega 3.     Besides that, salmon is full of vitamin B, vitamin D and selenium. These are all beneficial for human health.     Sardine     Sardines are one of the most popular fish specie around the world.     And extremely healthy too. One serving contains more than 2000 mg of Omega 3.     It also contains a lot of vitamin B, D, and selenium. Sardines are frequently available in cans too, and are quite affordable.     Atlantic mackerel     Mackerel is a small fish species, regularly consumed in the western world.     It can be cooked, or even smoked. Except for a high amount of Omega 3 fatty acids (more than 3000 mg per serving), they contain a lot of B12 vitamin and selenium. And not to forget, these are very tasty too.     Herring     Herrings are smaller fish, usually quite accessible and reasonably priced.     It is easy to cook them and they are rich in Omega 3 (about 1000 mg per serving).     Lake trout     Lake trout is extremely tasty, and healthy too.     This fish contains more than 1000 mg of Omega 3 per serving. Other trout species also contain a fair amount of Omega 3 fatty acids; however, lake trout has the most.     Cod     Cod has a bit lower Omega 3 content (below 1000 mg per serving), however it has a lot of vitamin B, phosphorus and selenium.     Because it is not so fatty, it has less calories too.     This fish is very healthy, and good for those who want to limit their calorie intake but still get a good amount of Omega 3 in their lunch.     Albacore Tuna     All tuna fish species are tasty and healthy, especially Albacore tuna.     This fish has more than 2000 mg of Omega 3 per serving.     Unfortunately, not all of us can get our hands-on Albacore tuna weekly, so use the opportunity when you can.     The reason why I wrote the content in serving size instead of per gram, is that rarely you will weight a fille you remove from a fish, or defrost is if you bought it frozen.     Additionally, many of you will consume fish in a restaurant, so you wont actually know how much it weights.     Typical serving size it the amount that a grown-up person eats per meal (lunch\/dinner).     Serving size, depending on a meal and side dish, is usually 100-250 grams.     Does Cooking Fish Reduce Omega 3?     It is good to consume fish that is high in omega 3, but will thermic processing reduce its content?     When exposed to extremely high temperatures, Omega 3 fatty acids will break down and the end result will be a tasty meal, but not that healthy one.     As you can assume, frying fish is the worst method.     A lot of people like fried bass - why? Check on the link ...     First of all, oil can reach very high temperatures so you will destroy Omega 3.     The second problem is that you will consume a lot of unhealthy oil which was used for frying.     If you want to keep the majority of Omega 3, try baking fish in the oven.     Put it on a temperature up to 200 degrees Celsius (390 Fahrenheit), and not warmer. This way, you will keep most of it and enjoy a healthy and nutrient rich meal.     Even better way is to cook it, but this limits your possibilities, as most fish species are baked or fried. While cooking it, you will never go over 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit), because that is the boiling point of water.     And the best option to keep all the nutrients is to eat smoked fish fillets.     Fish processed that way was not exposed to high temperatures and it contains all the Omega 3 it had when caught.     Just be careful not to eat too much because smoked fish contains a lot of salt.     Another thing that affects the loss of nutrients is prolonged heat exposure. The longer it takes, the more Omega 3 you will destroy, especially when frying it.     Does Canned Tuna Have Omega 3 Fatty Acids?     There are a lot of misconceptions and myths about tuna, especially canned one.     I will not debunk those now, but I will tell you about Omega 3 content of canned tuna.     Not every canned tuna is the same.     Albacore tuna, even when canned, has a high amount of Omega 3. Only canned fish with more Omega 3 are salmon and sardines.     Canned tuna should have larger pieces instead of tiny ones. Also, depending on a part of the tuna that ends up in a can, content of Omega 3 can vary.     Some people don\u2019t have access to fresh fish, and canned versions are easily accessible, and frequently cheaper.     If you wondered what fish is high in omega 3 fatty acids and comes in a canned form, the answer is Albacore tuna, as already mentioned.     This is definitely the best option.     Other species of tuna fish also contain Omega 3, and canning process doesn\u2019t significantly lower the Omega 3 content, however, those species contain less of it, even when fresh.     Conclusion     Fish that is high in omega 3 has a lot of health benefits, and those affect some of our most important organs.     Regularly consuming of fish species from this list is good for you, and you can even consume canned ones, because they will still contain plenty of Omega 3 fatty acids.     Be careful how you cook it, not to destroy these precious nutrients.     Except for omega 3, these species all contain a lot of vitamin B, which is also good for our bodies.     And one more thing, you should make sure that you always consume fresh and correctly stored fish, otherwise you are risking food poisoning.

      "text":" We Helped Produce The Slovenian Sportsman of the Year 2016 award     When several identical copies of an art work, ie. sculpture are desired we usually encounter a problem due to technological non-feasibility. Such cases call for compromises. This case study presents how we at TECOS approach such problems quickly and cost efficiently by applying methods of advanced 3D scanning and reverse engineering.     Problematics     hand made statue used as a base for creation of sand casting pattern     several details on the spiral are not manufacturable     short lead-time     We performed the following steps for the customer:     3D scanning of hand made statues (accuracy 0,02 mm)     Reverse engineering (creation of precise computer 3D model for further processing and modifications)     Preparation of the 3D model for the technological process of sand casting     Export of 3D model in neutral format     The final result was a technological 3D model with all little details, ready to be used for pattern design and production.     Purpose and Benefits For End Customer     quickly from purchase order to final result     no need for full understanding of production technologies by the customer - all communication with technologists from selected production company was done by us     high accuracy of scanning and original details     Below you can find some pictures and more description of project phases.     3D scanning     Two statues made of plaster were scanned.     Figure 1: Original statues     ATOS CS 5M structured light scanner was used for 3D scanning with the accuracy of 0,02 mm (achieveable also under 0,01 mm). Every detail was captured including some not wanted errors which were eliminated during reverse engineering phase. Figure 2 shows scanned data (STL model).     Figure 2: Scanned data; especially the flame displays surface irregularities due to hand-work     Reverse engineering     In this phase a 3D CAD model was produced based on scanned data. CAD model is a mathematical representation of surfaces which is used as an input data for the vast majority of conventional technics of pattern or toolmaking (either for casting, injection moulding or others). In the case that larger corrections on the model are not needed this phase can even be omitted and STL is used for direct manufacturing.     Figure 3: CAD model of an athlete and flame statues; smoothing of details as comparred to figure 2 which shows only scanned data can be observed     Final Result     The customer provided a picture of trial castings made on the basis of our models which turned out very good indeed. One of them went into the hands of Peter Prevc, 2016 ski-jumping world cup champion and owner of several records. "

Tip certifikata SSL OV Certifikat (Organization Validation)     What is an SSL Certificate?     SSL Certificates enable data encryption on the internet and allow data to be transmitted securely from a web server to a browser. With SSL, your website can use the https protocol and will display a padlock in end users web browsers to indicate the connection is secure.     Why do I need an SSL Certificate?     SSL Certificates are an essential part of the internet. They not only encrypt communication between your computer and the server where a website is located, but they also provide verification that a site is what it claims to be.     What are the different types of SSL?     There are 3 different levels of vetting that SSL Certificates are based upon. Domain Validated (DV) , Organization Validated (OV), and Extended Validation (EV). The major difference between the types of certificate relates to the information the Certificate Authority, RapidSSL, GeoTrust and DigiCert, requires and validates in order to issue a certificate. The higher levels of certificate require more information, and often is displayed in the browser bar. EV SSL for example turns the browser bar green and displays the organization name to visitors to generate more trust.     What is a Wildcard SSL Certificate     A Wildcard SSL certificate provides the same encryption and authentication features as other SSL certificates but can also be applied to an unlimited number of subdomains of a website. A Wildcard SSL certificate supports the root domain (example.com) as well as its subdomains. Learn more     What are the advantages of an EV SSL Certificate?     EV, or Extended Validation, is the highest class of SSL available today and gives more credibility and trust to your website than other SSL Certificates. They include features such as the green address bar and display of your company name that have been proven to boost trust and consumer confidence.     Our SSL certificates are from some of the most trusted brands in Online Security. "

Game is designed for two players. Score is displayed on the top of the screen. The player that reaches 11 points first, wins the game and the score bar is cleared. Different colors, ball speed and size, and size of the tables can be easily set, so the players can modify game appearance and difficulty according to their wishes.

Each of those three generates their part of the picture. PP_ball is the first in the row, and it draws the ball and score bar. Two Table IPs add the first and the second racket. They are in a series connection, and the last component sends the united RGB signal to the screen. Btn_RE IP is there for capturing the signals from the buttons and rotary encoder from the extern board.     Creating AXI peripheral block     To connect SDK application and hardware designed in Vivado there needs to be some registers reserved through which the data can be send and received from. There are two ways to do this. The first one is general purpose interface, AXI_GPIO. Two disadvantages of this solution are, that it uses a lot of resources, and that it only has two ports. Although it is a fast and simple solution, I would need to use a lot of them to communicate with all my ports. The second way is packing our code as AXI peripheral, where we can decide how many register we are going to use. Adresses can be seen in address editor above block diagram. The first address is written and others are shifted by 4, because 32 bits width data bus are used.     To make the AXI peripheral IP, write you code in vhdl, then select AXI peripheral when you want to package your IP.     Axi peripheral has two components. The first component is the one where registers are defined, the second one contains our code. To access our component, I included my code in the project and connected components with port map. Data bus width is set to 32 bit, but because not all bits are needed, I had to match the signal vector length with the number of bits that I am reading from the registers.     Draw Table component     This component has 3 inputs for tracking current cursor position on the screen, which are also visible on the block diagram. Additional 5 inputs, that aren\u2019t directly seen on the block diagram are connected to the registers. These are registers for communicating with SDK application. As I already mentioned each of the registers has its unique address and has to be initialized in the SDK.     Hardware inputs:     hst, vst and rgb - ports for monitor     rgbPrev - tells us what was is the output of the previous component. I connected the components in series, and don\u2019t want to overwrite the output with next component in series.     Software inputs:     data_position - position in the array     offset - moving picture on the screen     size - how much array we are using     background - which color is in the background, where we don\u2019t draw our picture     First I created an array, for saving my data. I choose array dimensions 16 * 256, with 3 bits for color data, so 8 different colors can be set.     Array mustn\u2019t be read from and written to at the same time, so I set the flag, to enable writing in it.     Below is the code that enables reading from the array. We have to remember that our array is smaller then the screen size, so we have to calculate, when our cursor is in the right position. I set picture start position (XOff, YOff), and the picture size (Hp_Size, Vp_Size).     Here is the picture of our region     Last thing that needs to be taken care of is sending data to the rgb output. I devided the whole region into 3 subregions:     outside the screen     inside the screen, but outside of the picture region     inside the picture region     According to this regions, I set different values on rgb data bus.     I have components connected in series, and I check if anything is already written on current point. If current component doesn\u2019t contain any new data, the previous data has higher priority than background, and previous data is send out. If nothing was written there I set the RGB signal to background.     Draw ball component     This component is similar to the previous one. Here rgb is set for the first time and that is why there isn\u2019t rgbPrev signal included. For score keeping I made separate array in the ball component. 3 bits of the 32 bits width are used for the background, the rest are unused. I added 3 more bits for the score bar color data, 11 bits to shift position on X axis as players gain points (Y axis is constant), and another bit for enabling writing in the array.     This could all be done in one component, but I decided to break the problem into smaller pieces for simplicity. Even if only one component is used, there would still have to be different arrays for every figure, because external RAM of the Red Pitaya can\u2019t be used, and there isn\u2019t enough memory on FPGA board to make the array as big as is needed.     Read buttons     On extension board there are 4 buttons and 1 rotary encoder. Their states are saved in the CLPD PISO register, and are later send one by one to Red Pitaya.     As is can be seen on the block diagram out IP interface has 3 output pins:     sck - 50 kHz clock for shifting data in shift register     load - data is uploaded in shift register     t - output that is then send to AXI_GPIO and used in SDK application.     clk50 - 50 MHz clock source     din - data from CPLD     Below is vhdl code that collects the data and sends it forward. Buttons are used for moving the rackets up and down the screen, while rotary encoder can be used to change game speed, ball or racket size. We need a process, where we gain information about the direction of rotation, and then the data can be manipulated in SDK environment. I used the rotary encoder for changing the size of the rackets.     The process where I read the buttons from the external board.     And another process below, for checking the direction of rotation of the rotary decoder.     Occupied resources     A picture below shows how many resources were used. You can find this information under Design runs below the block diagram.     SDK code     The game algorithm is all written in c programming language, and it is running separately from the FPGA part. I think the best way to explain the code is if I describe each function with a few sentences.     For easier ilustration of program execution below is a flow chart that shows how functions are called. Below is the picture how the games looks on the monitor.     Conclusion     In conclusion, this was my first project on Red Pitaya board. In the beggining I had quite a few problems, before everything was working the way I wanted, and even though I am quite happy with the result there are a few things that could be added and improved. Less resources could be used if all the arrays would be declared in one component and all the data bus width would be used. It depends what your goal is, less components spare the number of resources, but everything becomes more complicated to follow. Additional colors would also make aplication more interesting for different kinds of implementation. Another interesting thing would be to add bloks that display more graphic forms, for example different figures, text and graphs, that would really contribute to the application usefullness. "

      "text":" Afghanistan     Problem statement     In the shadow of never-finished wars, Afghanistan remains one of the poorest and most contaminated countries by mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) in the world. Despite significant achievements in the field of landmine clearance, where 77% of minefields have already been cleared, pressure-plate improvised explosive devices (PPIED) and other explosive remnants of war (ERW) are left as consequence of latest fightings. They kill and injure the civil population on daily basis, with more than 50 % of victims being children. In addition, ERW contamination is still present at former international military facilities and firing ranges resulting from the withdrawal of international military forces, who were present in the country for nearly 20 years.     This all poses an immediate danger towards the civil population and impedes further development of those areas.     In addition to problems related with ERW, Afghanistan citizens face severe issues related to health, such as difficult access to health services in rural areas, health issues related to contagious diseases, fertility and high birth mortality rate.     What we do     Cluster Munition Clearance     During two months in 2017, Demining Agency for Afganistan (DAFA) cleared 701,771 square meters of land, contaminated with cluster munition. During clearance, 440 UXOs, 7 BLUs and 15 SAA were found and destroyed.     Victim Assistance     TF was approached by NGO Mine Detection Center (MDC) in Kabul at the end of 2015 regarding possible support of the MDC Polyclinic. The project of supporting the MDC Polyclinic in Kabul enables free healthcare support to the deminers and their family members as well as the population of Kabul, in particular physiotherapeutic, psychosocial, gynecological and dental services as well as other examinations and consultations. The project specifically focuses on the services aimed at women and children, who cannot afford healthcare. Around 16,000 medical services, examinations and counselling were delivered on annual basis in the period of 2015-2020.     ITF has also supported the project \u201cProsthetics and Orthotics (P&O) workshop in Kunduz regional hospital\u201d, implemented by Humanity and Inclusion (HI). The project was conducted in Kunduz region in period from 1 July 2019 till 31 August 2020 and through the support of two P&O technicians and one support staff, the needs of most vulnerable Kunduz citizens with disabilities were met. During 2019 and 2020, more than 650 beneficiaries received certain services from Prosthetics and Orthotics workshop in Kunduz.     Capacity Building     ITF formally started to work in Afghanistan in 2014, when ANDMA (Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority) and ITF signed a Memorandum of Understanding. The Capacity Support to Mine Action Coordination and Transition in Afghanistan project officially started on 1 August 2014.     ITF has been supporting the development of national capacities in the field of mine action, specifically the Directorate of Mine Action Coordination (DMAC) as part of ANDMA, and provided coordination related to the delivery of quality assurance in Afghanistan's regions through salary payments for 30 Operational Personnel. In addition, ITF is covering all logistic and support costs of DMAC including DMAC Regional Offices.     For more information on ITF\u2019s past activities in Afghanistan, we welcome you to consult our Annual Reports, while for the plans in the forthcoming year please consider our Portfolio of Projects.     ITF has to date been implemented over 3,100 projects in 32 countries and regions. Help us advance our mission towards enhancing security of vulnerable individuals, communities and states.     @ITFsi: [GAZA] Last week ITF successfully conducted a two-day interactive training to provide proper knowledge on voluntary\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/WjfNxnz0E7     *The designation Kosovo is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSC 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

      "text":" Wisdom Tooth Removal     Wisdom tooth removal is a surgical procedure in which a wisdom tooth is extracted. Because of the imbalance between the size of the jaws and teeth, there are often problems with the growth of wisdom teeth and the placement of these teeth in the dental line. The tooth can remain ingrown in the bone (the tooth is completely covered by bone and the mucous membrane), partially ingrown (part of the tooth sticks out into the oral cavity) or it completely grows out. Ingrown teeth do not usually cause issues and in most cases extraction is not necessary. The issues are mostly caused by partially ingrown teeth. With these teeth, only a part of the crown is visible in the oral cavity, which is why a gum pocket is created here. Food gets caught in this pocket that is difficult or impossible to remove. Bacteria develop in the pocket, causing inflammation around the tooth. Because of the proximity of vital structures, this inflammation can quickly turn into a severe form. An extraction may also be necessary due to the formation of a cyst from a tooth follicle that surrounds the partially ingrown tooth.     The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia and is painless. After the procedure, moderate swelling, limited opening of the mouth and difficulty in swallowing may occur. Postoperative problems disappear within a few days after the procedure. "

The fate of the minority community of Carinthian Slovenians is told through an autobiographical family chronicle, which spans from World War II until today. All the great powers and ideas that have fatefully influenced the situation of the community and its individuals are a part of it;among those bearing the greatest weight are the traumas of World War II and the time after it. Through lyrical personal confession it retells memories: personal, family, collective, told and concealed. The stage adaptation managed to add to the novel a new dimension and to the inner world an outer image through excellent and thoughtful acting interpretations.     \"When the performance The Angel of Oblivionin the direction and adaptation of Igor Pison ends in its soft reconciliation, the spectator, under the influence of such a first-class theatre experience, has difficulties to comprehend what \u2018hit\u2019 him or her most. Was it the precisely worked-out adaptation of the novel; or was it the seemingly muted and ideologically unbiased directing thatwas the reason the story is played out in all its sensory and politically-chargedemotion? Or was it due to the gusts of biographic reality that sprout again through fiction as live probable images? Undoubtedly because of all of the above, but the crown goes to the excellent cast, which carries a contagious spark of total enjoyment in acting.\" (Zala Dobov\u0161ek, Delo)     Photo gallery     Our site uses cookies for social networks connections, better overall site performance and awesome user experience.

Te\u010daj so tako uspe\u0161no zaklju\u010dili Nika Ho\u010devar, Ur\u0161ka Jerman, Darko Gori\u010danec, Anton Jerman \u2013 Tone in Ga\u0161per \u0160krjanec. Z opravljenim te\u010dajem so vsi napredovali v \u010din Gasilec.     Pripravnica Maru\u0161a Pinta\u010d, ki se zaradi nekaj mese\u010dne odostnosti ni udele\u017eila te\u010daja v sklopu GZ Vodice, pa se ga je udele\u017eila v Polju. Prav tako Nadaljevalni te\u010daj za gasilca, ki sta ga zaradi visoke udele\u017ebe skupaj organizirala PGD Polje in PGD \u0160inkov Turn, se je zaklju\u010dil \u017ee decembra, katerega je uspe\u0161no opravila tudi na\u0161a \u010dlanica in napredovala v \u010din Gasilec.     \u0160e ena vest pa prihaja z obale. Na\u0161a \u010dlanica \u201cna posoji\u201d Jana Bali\u017e, je kot \u010dlanica PGD Se\u010dovlje, GZ Piran, prav tako opravila Nadaljevalni te\u010daj za gasilca in bo tako napredovala v \u010din Gasilec.     Vsem novim gasilcem za uspe\u0161no opravljanje te\u010daja \u010destita celotno poveljstvo PGD Repnje-Dobru\u0161a. \u017delimo si, da bi znanje nadgrajevali in z njim uspe\u0161no pomagali tistim, ki so pomo\u010di potrebni.

      "text":" We want to be sustainable, or do we?     3.12.2019     The Baby Boom, X, M and Z generations are the most economically successful generations ever. We achieve exceptional records.     Constant economic growth resulted in global energy consumption increasing in 2018 at a rate almost twice that of the average growth rate since 2010. Demand for all fossil fuels increased, even though solar and wind energy recorded double-digit growth. Consumption of petroleum increased in 2018 by 1.8%, while CO\u2082 emissions rose by 1.7% to reach a new record.*     Earth Overshoot Day was declared in June 2019 as humanity's demand for natural resources for the year exceeded the Earth's capacity to regenerate those resources that year. We continue to increase this deficit by liquidating the natural capital of the Earth and accumulating waste and emissions.     Not a day passes without news about the catastrophic consequences of climate change.     We do not have problems because of the climate crisis, but because of capitalism, greed, unethical conduct, lies, wrong objectives, obsolete education systems and unambitious politicians.     We have an exceptional opportunity to go down in history as the generations that changed the course of the world for the better. As the generations that ensured sustainable development in the true sense of the word, with clean energy, peace, welfare and health for all people. As the generations that created a new model of social economy which has begun to be referred to as \"sustainalism\".     All of us will need to change our habits. All individuals, all sectors, all companies and organisations. It is in these changes that exceptional opportunities for all are hidden.     No revolution (agrarian, industrial, digital) has had so much funding earmarked for investment as the climate revolution. Do we know how to use this funding correctly and ethically?     December is here, the time of reflection and New Year's resolutions. What will our resolutions be, what will we fulfil, which goods will increase in quantity?

Neustavljiv tempo nas v dana\u0161njem \u010dasu tako na zasebnem kot tudi na slu\u017ebenem podro\u010dju vedno bolj potiska v kot. To se nam dogaja zaradi dolgih urnikov, pritiskov, kratkih rokov, slabih medosebnih odnosov. Od zaposlenih se na delovnih mestih iz leta v leto zahteva vedno ve\u010d. Obvladovati in pokrivati je potrebno vedno ve\u010d podro\u010dij dela. Zaposleni za doseganje rokov delovne obveznosti pogosto odna\u0161ajo s seboj domov in opravljajo nadurno delo. \u010ceprav imajo delavci kopico nere\u0161enih nalog, jim njihovi nadrejeni dodajajo \u0161e ve\u010d novih. Zaposleni si kljub preobremenjenosti ne upajo re\u010di ne, ker se bojijo izgube slu\u017ebe. Posledica vsega tega je manj \u010dasa za prosto\u010dasne aktivnosti. Tako na delovnem mestu kakor tudi v privatnem \u017eivljenju \u017eelijo blesteti na vseh podro\u010djih; od star\u0161evstva, prijateljstva in udejstvovanja na dru\u017ebenih omre\u017ejih. Kopi\u010denje stisk, pritiskov in stresnih situacij lahko \u010dloveka privede do izgorelosti. Izgorelost je bolezen, ki ima dolgotrajne negativne posledice za posameznika in za organizacijo, zato je klju\u010dnega pomena, da se prvi znaki prepoznajo pravo\u010dasno in se zoper njih pravilno in pravo\u010dasno ukrepa. V teoreti\u010dnem delu diplomske naloge sem opredelil pojem izgorelosti, za katerega sem predpostavljal, da je pogosto prisoten med pripadniki Slovenske vojske (v nadaljevanju SV). V raziskovalnem delu diplomske naloge sem raziskoval poznavanje, pojavnost ter najpogostej\u0161e pokazatelje izgorelosti med pripadniki SV. Prav tako sem preverjal u\u010dinkovitost spoprijemanja zaposlenih v SV z izgorelostjo ter vzroke in posledice, ki privedejo do izgorelosti na delovnem mestu. Analiza raziskovalnih podatkov je pokazala, da pripadniki Slovenske vojske ve\u010dinoma pravo\u010dasno prepoznajo znake izgorelosti in se z njimi znajo tudi u\u010dinkovito in pravo\u010dasno spopasti.

Secondary language     Language:     English     Abstract:     People used to lead simple lives, unlike today, when the pace of life is speeding up almost on a daily basis. Today%s unstoppable pace of life is exerting pressure on our personal and professional lives. This happens because of long schedules, pressures, short deadlines, and poor interpersonal relationships. Throughout the years, demands on employees have increased. They must excel in and cover numerous fields of work. In order to meet the deadlines, employees often take their work home with them and work overtime. Even though they have a number of tasks which they still need to solve, their superiors add new tasks to their workload. Despite being overworked, they are afraid to say no in fear of losing their job. Consequently, they have less and less time for their personal life. The same as at work, they want to excel in all spheres of their personal life, from parenthood and time spent with friends to social networks. The accumulation of distress, pressure, and stressful situations can lead to burnout. Burnout is a disease with long-term negative consequences for the individual and the organisation and it is therefore of key importance to be able to recognise the signs on time and take appropriate action. This paper defines the concept of burnout which the members of the Slovenian Armed Forces are faced with in our jobs. A questionnaire was used to try to show familiarity with the concept of burnout and to study the most frequent indicators of job burnout. The second step was the coping of employees with burnout as well as the causes and consequences leading to job burnout. The filled in questionnaires have allowed us to conclude that members of the Slovenian Armed Forces mainly recognise signs of burnout on time and know how to cope with them. The diploma thesis was prepared with the help of references, online resources, and the questionnaire. Our own experience and findings of the studied material were added. "

      "text":" \u017divimo v dobi, ki jo velikokrat ozna\u010dujemo kot postmoderna. V dobi, v kateri za razliko od moderne dobe avtonomni subjekt izgine in \u010dlove\u0161tvo spozna svojo radikalno pogojenost od drugega. Prav tako s prizori\u0161\u010da izgine zadnji razlagalec stvarnosti, pojavi se radikalna pluralnost filozofskih smeri. Realnost postane razumljena kot konstruirana v smislu, da volja subjekta vzpostavlja pomene, ta pomenska mre\u017ea pa nima ve\u010d stika z realnostjo kot tako. Pri postmoderni konstrukciji realnosti imajo veliko vlogo mediji. Francoska misleca Jean Baudrillard in Paul Virilio sta analizirala, kako se odnos do realnosti vzpostavlja preko vpliva medijev. Izziv za teologijo je, kako s svojim vztrajanjem, da je Bog zadnja stvarnost, vstopiti v dialog s postmoderno miselnostjo in vanjo inkulturirati sporo\u010dilo evangelija. Inkulturacija evangelija v postmoderno dru\u017ebo ni mogo\u010da, \u010de dru\u017ebo, v kateri se nahajamo, vnaprej zavra\u010damo. Mo\u017ena je le tako, da sprejmemo dejansko stanje in znotraj tega nastopimo kot oznanjevalci evangelija. Pri tem ni ve\u010d bistveno vpra\u0161anje, ali naj uporabljamo sodobne tehnologije, ki \u010dedalje bolj postajajo substitucija na\u0161emu telesu, niti ni ve\u010d bistveno vpra\u0161anje, ali je potro\u0161ni\u0161ka dru\u017eba sprejemljiva ali ne in kako se od nje odvrniti. Bistveno vpra\u0161anje, ki se postavlja, je, kako uporabljati sodobno tehnologijo znotraj porabni\u0161ke dru\u017ebe, da bo Kristusov nauk sli\u0161en in bo hkrati obrodil vidne sadove v med\u010dlove\u0161kih odnosih in odnosih \u010dloveka z Bogom.     Sekundarni jezik     Angle\u0161ki jezik     Naslov:     Postmodern construction of reality by Baudrillard and Virilio as a challenge for theology     Izvle\u010dek:     We live in an era often called the postmodern era. In comparison with the modern era, this is an era in which an autonomous subject has disappeared and humanity has become aware of being radically determined by the other. At the same time, the last interpreter of the reality has disappeared and a radical plurality of philosophical directions has appeared. Reality is understood as constructed in the sense that the subject\u2019s will establishes meanings, yet this web of meanings does not have any connection with the reality as such. The media have played a large role in the postmodern construction of reality. French philosophers Jean Baudrillard and Paul Virilio analyzed how the relation to reality is established through the influence of media. The challenge of theology is to discover how to enter into a dialogue with the postmodern mentality and inculturate into it the gospel message while insisting that God is the last reality. The inculturation of the gospel into the postmodern society is not possible if we reject the society in which we live. It is only possible if we accept the reality and act as witnesses of the gospel within it. Therefore, the question whether to use modern technologies, which are becoming more and more the substitutes of our bodies, is no longer relevant. The same can be said about the question whether a consumer society is acceptable or not and how to turn away from it \u2013 it is also no longer relevant. The essential question that has to be asked is how we can use modern technologies inside the consumer society to make Christ\u2019s teachings heard and bear fruit that would be visible in interpersonal relationships and in personal relationships with God.

Organizing surveys in folders     List of all created surveys positioned in 'My surveys' directory can be organized in folders, which is especially useful for users with larger number of surveys. To view surveys in folders, advanced interface has to be switched off; this can be set in the 'My Survey' \u2013 'Settings' \u2013 'User settings' tab.     Folders are displayed or hidden with click on Folder button, positioned on right side. Under the Create Survey button the Create new folder button will appear.     In the interface for creating survey 'My surveys' \u2013 'Create Survey', in the Basic Info part you can determine the folder in which the survey will be stored. The latter is possible only in the case of enabled storing in folders and subfolders (in the directory 'My Survey' click on the right button Folders).     You can also add the survey to the folder during the survey editing, this can be done in the section 'EDIT' \u2013 'Settings' \u2013 'Basic settings', where you can determine the folder you want in 'Basic info'.     Surveys, which are not in any of specifically selected folder, will appear in the last folder on the list, named 'Unallocated survey'. Other folders are arranged alphabetically.     Folders can:     be renamed, by clicking on it;     be moved, by dragging and dropping on selected place;     contain subfolders that you create by clicking on a blue plus sign next to the existing folder;     be deleted, by clicking on an orange minus sign next to the folder. If you delete folder with surveys, surveys will not be deleted; they will only be rearranged in the 'Unallocated survey' folder.     Functionality is intended solely for the administrative organization to increase transparency of the surveys and does not affect surveys themselves. "

Ohranitev dedi\u0161\u010dine bi morala biti predsem vzajemna odlo\u010ditev in naloga nosilcev kulturnih pojavov, lastnikov in stroke ob sodelovanju vseh potrebnih dele\u017enikov.

Abstract The planners of contemporary international and domestic protection legislation have now also recognized the crucial roles of the ethnological perspective and conservator-ethnologists in processes of cultural heritage conservation. The well-established and the additional tasks of conservator-ethnologists are presented and substantiated through the protective legal framework and connected in the work programme model of conservatorethnologists. Heritage preservation should be mainly a mutual decision and obligation of agents, proprietors and experts as well as all other stakeholders. The selected cultural phenomena should be presented with the help of tried and tested, recognised or innovative solutions as possible development potential to planners at all levels, both vertical and horizontal.

INDIVIDUALNO SVETOVANJE     Za uporabnike 1KA nudimo individualno svetovanje na podro\u010djih     ONLINE SERVICE     1KA service can be used free of charge at 1KA.si domain. Only registration is required (new users) or login (registered users).     Frequently Asked Questions - GDPR     1. How is server security in 1KA offline installation regulated?     1KA is an application that requires a server to operate. When installing 1KA on PCs (1KA offline), 1KA uses one of the free servers (UWAMP), which is a well-known and very well-documented application.     The 1KA installation is also well tested on this server, but problems may arise solely from additional security configurations that the user may have. This should then be addressed further (maybe in collaboration with the 1KA Help Centre). If users have some very advanced or specific security configurations and requirements, instead of UWAMP, we recommend installing a classic 1KA, where the user must, of course, take care of the entire server layout and configuration.     More information about the UWAMP server: www.uwamp.com\/en\/     Before using the 1KA application (general or any other installation), read the general terms of use of the tool: https:\/\/www.1ka.si\/d\/en\/about\/terms-of-use\/general-terms.     2. How does the 1KA tool regulate compliance with GDPR laws and internal acts?     1KA installations installed on the servers of the University of Ljubljana are properly taken care of. More information on technical and other measures for survey editors is available here https:\/\/www.1ka.si\/d\/en\/gdpr.     Advanced users can optionally sign a more or less customized data processing agreement (DPA) if they wish. The DPA is available in the 'My Surveys' directory, where all users have the 'GDPR' tab available, with a PDF version (LINK).     Of course, for your own installations, any additional server adjustments must be made by the user.     3. Does 1KA enable audit trail traceability?     The 1KA application allows complete traceability of all interventions in the 1KA application itself (e.g. who and when viewed the data, who and when modified it in the questionnaire or in the data, etc.). All of its installations also track the traceability of server-side interventions using the Linux Audit Daemon system installed on the server. It is configured to record, inter alia:     any user login and elevation of user privileges on the system;     any programs and terminal commands of any user (including system users such as web, cron, etc);     access to (read, write) all subfolders on the file system by installing 1KA (1KA web root);     accessing (reading, writing) files on file systems containing databases;     in combination with audit daemon, all SQL queries are logged in SQL log files.     Log data is securely and encrypted additively transmitted to a secondary server in another location (VPN, rSync via SSH) - deleting server files or their contents is not transmitted to another server.     The log files on the primary server are deleted daily, and on the secondary server, they are packaged daily in encrypted archives and kept for 30 days for security purposes.     4. Audit trail on your own installations and offline 1KA     In its own installations, traceability is the responsibility of the installer. In principle (and more theoretically, but practically this is very difficult), log-based changes can be made to track all changes and interventions in a specific 1KA survey, even if it was deleted in 1KA. However, a special \"audit daemon\" for server interventions is not installed on off-line 1KA and should be edited by the user if desired. You should know that the entire off-line installation of 1KA is only temporary, since after the survey is completed the data is exported and therefore it is the responsibility of the user to remove the entire installation afterwards, thus removing all traces.     The above applies to server-level audit trail (access to MySQL database, access to the server, etc.), depending on the server or the computer on which the application is located and not from the application itself. This must be provided by the user of his own installation or offline 1KA.     The audit trail at the application level itself (questionnaire changes, viewing and changing answers) is part of the application and works the same with offline versions.     5. Description of personal data processing within 1KA     Personal Data Controller - Registered users of the application who create and perform the online survey. As users process data on their own behalf, they are the controllers of personal data.     Organization - an FSD organization that acts as a contractor in relation to its managers. This allows managers to use 1ka and store information on servers.     Respondent - Individuals who solve a survey prepared and produced by a personal data controller.     The user of the web application can be anyone who registers on the site and accepts the general terms of use for the purpose of creating an online survey. The user is, according to the GDPR, a data controller who processes the data in the course of conducting an online survey for his or her own purposes. Anyone invited by the user to participate in the survey can answer the survey.     In his user profile, each manager has access to data from solved surveys that he has created through his profile. This information may also be accessed by any other registered user to whom the operator grants the rights. The user accounts are stored permanently on a server in Slovenia, along with the controller\u2019s surveys.     The organization acts as a contracted processor and does not use data collected through 1KA for its own purposes. For controllers, the organization stores data on third-party servers and provides them with a tool for conducting surveys.     6. Who are the contracted processors of 1KA?     Data from application 1KA is stored on the server of the contracted processor of the organization (Telemach d.o.o.) in Slovenia.     The 1KA user agrees that the 1KA service may contract with the hosting subcontractors and other subcontractors that support the functionality of the 1KA service.     The relevant contract (between 1KA and the sub-processor) and the associated GDPR attachment may be annexed to the 1KA user at the explicit request.     7. How long are backups stored for?     Daily backups of system events (log-ins) are saved.     Log data is securely and encrypted additively transmitted to a secondary server in another location (VPN, rSync via SSH) - deleting server files or their contents is not transmitted to another server.     The log files on the primary server are deleted daily, and on the secondary server, they are packaged daily in encrypted archives and kept for 30 days for security purposes. Monthly backups are stored at the DRC location for 6 months.     8. How is the process of deleting personal data from a backup performed? How are changes in the backups recorded?     Within the backup system, the system administrator opens the file to locate the appropriate respondent whose personal data is deleted. The file is modified and packed back to the archive as requested. Care must be taken not to damage the integrity of the backup.     In the case of an individual's request for the deletion of personal or survey data, in principle, the deletion shall be carried out only in the primary source. A log is kept for backups for any subsequent procedures into backups. It records who and when interfered with the backup.     Backup deletions are, in principle, only possible if a specific backup is restored. The responsible person in charge of a particular survey must, therefore, re-erase the restored backup copy. "

It must be clearly evident that, for example, the animals were not subjected to inhumane treatment, and that the experiments were carried out within the framework of the state and local laws and regulations governing the treatment of and working with experimental animals. For the Republic of Slovenia (RS), the law in force is the Law on the Protection of Animals (ZZZiv) published in 2013 in Official Gazette of the RS (Uradni list RS, \u0161t. 38\/2013). In the case of research on plants, it must be evident from the description of the experiment that no destruction of the biotic diversity was involved. Publication will be made only of the research works which are conducted in accordance with the above-mentioned ethical code. A detailed description must also be given of all factors which have been altered in the experiment, and which could influence the research results. A suitable statistical model must be used which enables a correct analysis of the data.     Results The Results can form a separate section or can be combined with discussion section. In the Results section, the text relates to the results obtained, although it should not contain a repetition of the data given in the tables or figures.     Discussion In the Discussion, in clear language, the biological or other mechanisms must be described. The results should also serve to clarify the hypothesis which was formulated in the Introduction, and which in the continuation of the experiment was either rejected or supported with the results.     Conclusion In the Conclusion, the main findings of the research must be highlighted.     Acknowledgements The Acknowledgements follow the Discussion, and are placed before the References.     References The references should be cited in accordance with the American Psychological Association (APA, 1993; 269: 2282-6). In the text, only the most important citations from the literature must be given, and for specific assertions not more than three citations arranged in chronological order should be included. When citing authors in the text, the following approaches are used: in case of only one author of the cited article use either Bozzi (2015) or (Bozzi, 2015); in case of two authors, cite the reference throughout the text as Bonneau and Lebret (2010) or as (Bonneau and Lebret, 2010) and in case of several authors, cite the reference throughout the text with \u201cet al.\u201d following the last name of the first author, e.g. \u0160krlep et al. (2017), or as (\u0160krlep et al., 2017). If the same author appears with several articles published in the same year, this should be noted with added letters (Skok et al., 2016a, Skok et al., 2016b). The cited references must also be suitably marked in the review of the literature. Refe\u00adren\u00adces which are cited in the text, and which have been accep\u00adted for publication but have not yet been published can be listed in the literature cited with the designation (\"in press\") following the journal title.

Gregor Prosen, Mirko Bombek, Vojko Kanic, Andrej Markota, Klemen Dov\u010d     University Medical Center Maribor, Clinic for Internal Medicine, Maribor, Slovenia; Adolf Drolc Health Center Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia, 3University of Maribor, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal medicine, Maribor, Slovenia     CORRESPONDENCE     Andrej Markota, Univerzitetni klini\u010dni center Maribor, Klinika za interno medicino, Ljubljanska 5, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenija Telefon +386 51311519 E-po\u0161ta: andrejmarkota@hotmail.com     ABSTRACT     Purpose: The number of elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis and comorbidities is increasing in the aging populations of \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries. Unacceptably high perioperative mortality and morbidity makes the decision to undertake surgical aortic valve replacement in this group of patients difficult and unlikely. Development of less invasive procedures such as balloon aortic valvuloplasty and transcatheter aortic valve replacement is emerging as another treatment option.     Case report: A 84-year-old female with previous left-sided hemiparesis after stroke and severe aortic stenosis presented with pulmonary edema to our institution. Non-invasive ventilation and inotropic support were unsuccessful. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was done as as emergency procedure and she improved immediately. She was discharged after 25 days of inhospital treatment. She died 8 weeks later of unrelated reasons (infected decubitus and sepsis).     Conclusion: Balloon aortic valvoluplasty might be used as temporary and interim therapeutical options for patients with severe aortic stenosis and acute left ventricular failure who have unacceptably high risks when aortic valve replacement or emergency transcatheter aortic valve implantation is considered. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty may be used as a bridge to both procedures. "

The river banks and many other important buildings were designed by renowned Slovenian architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik. Strolling through the city streets, one enjoys the pleasant view of the remnants of the Roman settlement Emona, the medieval old town, works by Ple\u010dnik, Baroque architecture and modern buildings specked with parks and squares.

      "text":" Coastal areas in the northernmost part of the northern Adriatic Sea (Gulf of Trieste and adjacent Grado lagoon) are characterized by high levels of mercury (Hg) in sediments and water column mainly originating from the suspended material inflowing through the Isonzo - So\u010da river, originating from the Idrija (NW Slovenia) mining district, into the Gulf of Trieste. The Hg pollution is a result of 500-year mining activity reflected in a wide public health concern. Hzpoxic and anoxic conditions at the sediment-water interface are frequently observed in the Gulf of Trieste and in the lagoon due to stronglate summer density stratification and high organic matter input. Hg mobility at the sediment-water interface was investigated at three sampling points located in the Gulf of Trieste (AA1, CZ) and Grado Lagoon (BAR). Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions at in situ temperature using a dark flux chamber simulating an oxic-anoxic transition.Temporal variations of dissolved Hg and MeHg as well as O2, NH4+, NO3-, PO43-, H2S, Fe2+, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were monitored simultaneously. Fluxes of solutes across the sediment-water interface were calculated from linear regressions of the variation of solute concentrations, measured in oxic and anoxic conditions with incubation time. Our results show low benthic Hg effluxes and even influxes in oxic conditions and effluxes in the anoxic phase of the experiment. MeHg release was less noticeable (low or absent) in the oxic phase, probably due to similar methaylation and demethylation rates, but high in the anoxic phase of the experiment. In this context, the MeHg flux was linked to sulphate reduction and dissolution of Fe (and Mn), oxyhydroxides, and formation of sulphides and carbonates. The impact of DOM on Hg and MeHg oxic and anoxic fluxes was of minor importance, suggesting that the majority of dissolved Hg and MeHg are not linked to DOM. In the reoxigenation phase, studied at sampling point CZ by opening the chamber after a period of two weeks, the concentrations of MeHg and Hg dropped rapidly probably due to re-adsorption onto Fe (Mn) hydroxides and enhanced demethylation. Sediments, especially during anoxic events, should be, hence, considered as a primary source of MeHg for the water column in the northern Adriatic coastal areas. "

      "text":" HelpOnProcessingInstructions     MoinMoin processing instructions have the same semantics as in XML: they control the paths taken when processing a page. Processing Instructions (PIs) are lines that start with a \"#\" character followed by a keyword and optionally some arguments; the keyword is always handled case-insensitive. Two consecutive hash marks at the start of a line are a comment that won't appear in the processed page.     All PIs must appear at the very start of a page. An exception are comment PIs, those may appear anywhere within a page using \"wiki\" format, but not in pages using other formats.     For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing.     Any other installed parser name. See HelpOnParsers for additional parsers available and ParserMarket for user provided parsers.     Some parsers can accept optional arguments. Check the documentation of the parser for the possible options.     #redirect     #refresh     Redirect to a different page (or an external URL or just refresh the same page, if left out)     Needs to be enabled in the server configuration, see HelpOnConfiguration     target can be either a page name, or a fully qualified url. Here are two examples:     #pragma     Sets processing modes for this page:     Mode names are not case-sensitive.     MoinMoin knows few pragmas, and you may add more and use them for your own themes or macros. Here are the known pragmas:     section-numbers     Switches automatic numbering of section headers.     off or 0 disable numbering, on or 1 enables numbering. The default mode is set by the show_section_numbers config option.     When enabling numbering, its possible to use specific heading level:     Only displays section numbers for headings of level 2 and up (similarly for 3 to 6).     keywords     adds a <meta> tag with keywords which tells search engines what you can find on the particular page.     description     adds a <meta> tag which contains the description of the particular page.     supplementation     is used to enable or disable a supplementation for the current page e.g. a discussion page     off disables the supplementation for the current page. See also HelpOnConfiguration\/SupplementationPage for more.     #deprecated     Mark this page as deprecated.     Further changes to the page will create no backup versions and using it will cause the current revision to show along with the revision previous to the deprecation. This allows you to remove all of the page's content, insert #deprecated, and then write a short message explaining the reason behind this action. By doing this you are effectively freezing the last version of the page and reducing its rank in search results, but you are keeping the content available for viewing.     Removing the PI from the page will store no backup of the deprecation warning.     In comparison to #REDIRECT this PI gives the ability to give the user a reason why this page is no longer of use and why they should go to a new one, while #REDIRECT will throw them to the new page without any reason.     Not removing the page's content when adding #deprecated will cause the page to render twice.     #language     Set page language and direction.     Set page language and direction. Language name is the iso-639-1 code. MoinMoin ignore languages that does not have a translation file in MoinMoin\/i18n\/. See also HelpOnLanguages. "

      "text":" Climate change     Why should we care?     Slovenia is characterized by large variability in weather and climate conditions, resulting in the increased number of extreme weather events. These affect the production of food, causing flash floods and landslides as well as the damage to buildings, in extreme cases, threaten human lives.     Climate change represents an increasing threat to environmental, social and economic development and requires rapid intervention.     Slovenia lies in the temperate geographical zone, which is characterised by great variability of climate and weather conditions. Slovenia\u2019s territory is an interweaving of the effects of the Mediterranean, mountain and continental climate, and every year witnesses extreme weather events. Temperature measurements indicate climate change as has been observed elsewhere in Europe. The average temperature is rising, and the increase has been most noticeable over the last 20 years. Atmospheric warming is not the only consequence of climate change; it also brings changes in air currents, weather patterns, the distribution and quantity of precipitation and the frequency and strength of hazardous weather phenomena. The damage caused in Slovenia by exceptional weather and climate phenomena is rising steeply, in part because of the increasingly costly infrastructure and construction in areas previously not intensively exploited owing to the great exposure to natural forces.     Deviations from the normal distribution of precipitation through the year can cause drought or floods. In recent years Slovenia has frequently witnessed severe summer droughts, when a summer lack of precipitation has been accompanied by high air temperatures and unusual amounts of sunny weather. On the other hand damage is also caused by flooding. Slovenia is increasingly seeing green winters, with dwindling quantities of fresh snowfall in the lowlands. Plants are responding to the warmer atmosphere with extended growing seasons and are therefore more vulnerable to spring freezes.     Given their low-lying position, both glaciers in Slovenia \u2013 the Triglav glacier and the glacier below Mt. Skuta \u2013 are sensitive to climate change. With continued growth in atmospheric temperatures their transformation from glaciers to snowfields is expected.     In terms of number of storms, Slovenia is one of the top countries of Europe. Each year there are several severe storms which cause major damage, mostly from hail, strong gusts of wind and downpours. Strong short-lived downpours or abundant several-day rainfall can cause flooding, since the predominantly torrential character of watercourses means they rise very quickly. Saturation of the terrain can trigger landslides. In the future it is anticipated that the snowmelt will start earlier, bringing high river flows in the early spring. This is already causing a minimal rise in the sea level, which in the future will affect low-lying coastal areas, such as saltpans.     For the period up to the end of the 21st century, with the current trend of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and assuming the middle scenario will play out (IPPC, 2007), Slovenia can expect an increase in temperatures of between 3 and 3.5 \u00b0C, with summers heating up by 4 to 4.5 \u00b0C. On the annual level, the amount of precipitation should fall by approximately 10 %. This means summers will be significantly drier, by 15-20 %, while in winter we can even expect an increase in the amount of precipitation of up to 10 %. For this reason, green winters will be more common in lowland areas, and we can also expect more heat waves with stronger downpours and storms (Bergant, 2009). Another source (MKGP, 2008) states that in the period from 2001-2030 air temperatures are expected to rise by 0.5 to 2.5 \u00b0C, from 2031 to 2060 by 1 to 3.5 \u00b0C and from 2061 to 2090 by 1.5 to 6.5 \u00b0C. Predictions for the change to the annual level of precipitation range from +10 % to \u201330 %. There is even greater uncertainty surrounding the future quantity and distribution of precipitation by season. Some predictions point to a reduction in summer precipitation of up to 20 % (MKGP, 2008).     With the rapid population growth and excessive consumption of natural resources, society is becoming increasingly sensitive to climate change. The fact is that GHG emissions are growing, mainly from the energy and transport sectors. The growth in emissions is largely a consequence of economic growth both in Slovenia and the wider region, a consequence of which is the divergence between the economic and environmental components of development. Pronounced growth of emissions from transit traffic has been observed especially since the Slovenia\u2019s entry into the EU. By signing the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Slovenia joined the efforts to reduce the impact of human activity on the environment, and by signing the Kyoto Protocol it is committed to reduce its emissions by 8 % relative to 1986 in the first target period of 2008\u20132012. In order to achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets, Slovenia will use a system of trading in rights to GHG emissions covering around 44 % of all emissions, while it will also claim GHG sinks and flexible Kyoto mechanisms. According to projections, Slovenia\u2019s GHG emissions will fall between 2008 and 2012, but will still be above the target value of the Kyoto Protocol. Although the impact of the economic crisis on GHG emissions is unknown, based on past trends, even with the claiming of carbon sinks, the Kyoto target will not be met by Slovenia.     What are the related drivers and pressures?     The rapid population growth and excessive use of natural resources is increasing sensitivity to climate variability. The fact is that GHG emissions are rising in Slovenia. The biggest emmissions are from energy and transport sector. Growth in emissions is mainly due to economic development.     Slovenian ecological footprint reflects unsustainable patterns of energy use in transport and energy sectors, which contribute the most to total emissions of GHGs.     In 2005 a total of 51 % of Slovenia\u2019s inhabitants lived in urban areas, which is much less than the European average of 72 % (IMAD, 2009). The population is moving from the bigger cities to surrounding areas, increasing pressure on farmland and on the existing municipal and social infrastructure. Daily mobility is also increasing.     In the economic sphere, the period of the last ten years has been marked by a relatively slow restructuring towards the strengthening and growth of services, with a rapid decline in the importance of farming and a gentle decline in the share of industry. Compared to the rest of the EU, Slovenia has a relatively high proportion of manufacturing industry, and the structure of the economy points to above-average shares of energy-intensive industrial processes in the metallurgical, non-metallurgical, and paper industries. These are sectors that rank among the worst in terms of the intensity of atmospheric emissions per unit of production (IMAD, 2009).     Since 1999 Slovenia\u2019s ecological footprint has grown steadily. The major contributing factor is energy sector. According to data from the Global Footprint Network (GFN), in 2006 Slovenia\u2019s footprint amounted to 3.9 gha \/person, slightly below that of Europe \u2013 4.5 gha\/person. Since 1999, Slovenia has been in an environmental deficit, amounting in 2006 to \u20131.5 gha\/person (GFN, 2009).     Figure 1: Ecological footprint, biocapacity and ecological deficit in Slovenia Source: GFN, 2009.     In 2007, GHG emissions in Slovenia amounted to 20,722 kt CO2 equivalent, with the estimate for 2008 standing at 21,331 kt.     Having signed the Kyoto Protocol, under which Slovenia is committed to an 8 % reduction of GHG emissions relative to 1986, in the period 2008\u20132012 the country will have to reduce total emissions to an annual level of 18,726 kt CO2 equivalent. In total combined GHG emissions in 2007, the major component was CO2 \u2013 82 %. This was followed by methane, 10.5 %, mainly from farm waste; and N2O, 6.4 %, from farming and transport. Emissions of F-gases \u2013 HFC, PFC and SF6 \u2013 are contribute very little, 1.1 %, although owing to their high greenhouse effect, their contribution to atmospheric warming is not negligible. Despite the fact that relative to the base year, total GHG emissions have not changed much, in 2007 there was a significant change to their distribution by sector. The major contribution to total GHG emissions is from the energy sector, 32 % in 2007, followed by transport, 26 % in 2007. Increasing road traffic has led to total GHG emissions over the last two years increasing by more than a percentage point annually, cancelling out reduction efforts in all other sectors. The growth of emissions from transport is a consequence particularly of economic growth both in Slovenia and across the region. A marked reduction in emissions relative to the base year, from 22 % to 11 % in 2007, has been noted in the fuel consumption sector in industry and construction. No such major changes have been recorded in other sectors. Emissions from agriculture were slightly lower owing to a reduction in the number of cattle, the result of intensification of animal husbandry. Relative to the base year, emissions from waste management rose by 21 %, something contributed solely by emissions from municipal landfills. In this time wastewater emissions have fallen (PS03).     Slovenia has a relatively large amount of forest, covering 58.5% of its territory, (GZ04), which could be exploited as a sink, thereby reducing GHG emissions. According to recent estimates, around 5,000 ha of land is being overgrowing with forests each year in Slovenia. The latest census of forest resources for 2005 also contains the estimated accumulation of carbon in forests. According to data from this, the average annual accumulation of CO2 in forests \u2013 not taking annual felling into account \u2013 in the period 1990-2005 was as much as 9,867 kt CO2 equivalent a year, representing almost 50 % of annual emissions of CO2. Slovenia\u2019s permitted quota of sinks is 1,320 kt CO2 equivalent (OP TGP-1, 2009).     In the energy sector, in 2007, the main contribution to GHG emissions was the consumption of energy, with a share of 81 %, and highest within this were heat and power generation and transport. For the period 2000\u20132007, owing to the generation of heat and power, emissions increased by almost 20 % \u2013 average annual growth 2.6 % \u2013 and in 2007 growth amounted to 3.3 % (EN01).     After falling in 2007, energy end-use rose markedly in 2008. The increase resulted from growth in transport and broad consumption, while it fell in industry. The biggest share in energy end-use was held by transport, followed by industry, households and other consumption (EN10).     Figure 2: Annual GHG emissions by sector in Slovenia Source: GHG Archive, Environmental Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, March 2009 (Ref: Environment Indicators in Slovenia, PS03)     Figure 3: Energy end-use by sector for the period 1992-2008 and shares of individual sectors in energy end-use in 1992, 2000, 2005 and 2008 Source: Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, 2009; Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, 2009. (Ref: Environment Indicators in Slovenia, EN10)     Slovenia has in comparison with the EU high energy intensity     Slovenia has in comparison with the EU high energy intensity, which can be attributed to the low GDP per capita in the EU average, a high share of industry in GDP and the impact of transit traffic. In 2008 the energy-intensity of total energy consumption increased again after six years of reduction, representing a departure from the set goals. A comparison of intensity in 2007, calculated from gross domestic product (GDP) using purchasing power parity, shows that the intensity of the Slovenian economy is approximately 12 % higher than for the EU-25 as a whole (EN11).     In 2008 total energy consumption increased by significantly more than the average for the period 1992-2008. The greatest share was taken by liquid fuels, followed by solid fuels, nuclear energy, gas fuels and renewable energy sources. In 2008 there were increased shares of liquid fuels, nuclear energy and renewable energy sources. Growth of total energy consumption in Slovenia is higher than in EU-15 (EN16).     The proportion of renewable sources in total energy consumption in 2008 increased, amounting to 10.9 %, which is still 1.1 percentage points lower than the national target that should be reached by 2010. A total of 55 % of all renewable energy is used for heating, and the remainder for electricity generation. Biomass predominates, accounting for 55 % of all consumption of renewable energy sources, while hydro energy accounts for 41 % (EN18).     In 2008, electricity generation from renewables was markedly higher than the previous year owing to higher water levels in rivers and the start of co-incineration of wood biomass in large thermal power facilities. Nevertheless Slovenia attained a proportion that was 13 % lower than the target (EN19).     By 2007 GHG emissions from transport had increased in Slovenia by 165 % relative to 1986, the biggest rise being in road transport, 174 %. The increase in emissions stems from the growth in the number of vehicles and transit traffic \u2013 especially after 2004, when Slovenia joined the EU (PR09).     The volume of tonne-kilometres completed by Slovenian transporters increased by as much as 52 % from 2004 to 2007. The number of goods vehicle crossings of the border with Hungary in the same period rose by 112 % (PR02). Introducing biofuels in Slovenia and the objectives in this area are lagging behind the reference values given in the EU directive promoting the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels in transport, which amount to 2 % by the end of 2005 and 5.75 % by the end of 2010. Slovenia\u2019s lag is largely due to the limited scope for producing biofuels in the country (PR13).

Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS), 2009. (Ref: Environment Indicators in Slovenia, PR02)     What is the 2020 outlook?     GHG emission projections for 2020 indicate a decrease, despite the projected economic growth. It seems that the Kyoto goal for Slovenia in 2012 will not be reached.     Predictions of how climate change will be reflected in the physical environment are to a large extent hampered by the interweaving of mountain, continental and Mediterranean climates, and by the geographical characteristics of Slovenia. Relative to the current values of GHG emissions, projections have been made for the period 2010-2012-2020.     GHG projections are related to two possible scenarios of reduction - the first with some measures and the second scenario with additional ones. The second envisages a greater intensity of implementing measures in broad consumption and industry and increased financing amounting to \u20ac100 million. Since higher energy efficiency will only affect industry, the projections in broad consumption will only be impacted by greater intensity of implementing measures \u2013 additional funds for energy efficiency measures in buildings and additional funds for awarding favourable loans for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures (OP TGP-1, 2009).     Base GHG emissions for Slovenia amount to 20,354 kt CO2 equivalent. A reduction of 8 % means that in the period 2008\u20132012 Slovenia would have to achieve average annual emissions of 18,726 kt CO2 equiv. In achieving the Kyoto target, in accordance with resolution 11\/CP.7 of the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Slovenia can use CO2 sinks tied to increased wood biomass in forests in the amount of 1.32 Tg CO2 equiv. It follows from this that in the Kyoto period Slovenia must reduce average annual emissions to 20,046 kt CO2 equivalent (OP TGP-1, 2009).     Projections of GHG emissions using the scenario with measures for the period 2008\u20132012 indicate a reduction in emissions to the value of 21,112 kt CO2 equiv. or, with additional measures, 21,083 kt CO2 equiv. both of which are above the target value of 18,726 kt CO2 equiv. Even claiming the permitted sinks\u2013 the average permitted sinks for the period 2008\u20132012 amount to 1,320 kt CO2 equiv. \u2013 the Kyoto target will not be met (Poro\u010dilo ETS, 2009). For this reason, based on both projections and permitted sinks, Slovenia will not fulfil its Kyoto obligations. The difference in emissions will have to be compensated by using flexible Kyoto mechanisms. At the envisaged price of 15 \u20ac\/t CO2, purchasing the necessary rights to emit GHGs in the period 2008\u20132012, based on projections that still do not include the effects of the economic crisis on emissions, Slovenia will need to spend a little less than \u20ac80 million (OP TGP-1, 2009).     Table 1 Projections of GHG emissions taking into account measures and additional measures, and comparison with Kyoto targets.     The chief sources of GHG emissions are energy supply and transport. In 2008 emissions from these two sectors should, together, remain the same \u2013 a reduction of emissions from heat and power generation as a result of lower quotas in the EU-ETS system, balanced by an increase in emissions from transport due to a major growth in sales of diesel fuel, largely to transit traffic. After 2008, emissions from generation should hardly change, mainly due to the set quotas for the period 2008-2012. Emissions from transport should gradually fall, in part due to the economic crisis and in part to the construction of railway infrastructure and an increase in public passenger transport. After 2012, owing to the reduced quotas in the EU-ETS system, a reduction in GHG emissions from energy supply is envisaged, and an increase in emissions from transport. The latter should be ascribed to increased transport, as a result of the enlargement of the EU to include the countries of the western Balkans. After a slight rise in the period 2008-2012, partly from industrial emissions not included in EU-ETS, emissions from industry will decline after 2012 markedly. This also applies to broad consumption, especially after 2009. A reduction will be the consequence of implementing measures in buildings and increasing the share of renewable energy sources in heat production. In agriculture, owing to the growing numbers of animals, emissions will show a modest increase, while, owing to reduced quantities of biodegradable waste being disposed of, emissions from waste will fall. (OP TGP-1, 2009)     In 2010 GHG emissions compared to 2007 should be lower from energy supply, -8 %; industry, -11 %; and waste -1 %; but higher in transport, +12 %; other areas, +34 % in the scenario with some measures and +33 % in the scenario with additional measures; and +2 % from agriculture. The scenario for 2020 points to a similar situation \u2013 compared to 2007, emissions will be lower in energy supply, -24 %; industry, -22 %; and -16 % from waste; but higher from transport, +24 %; from other areas, +18 % or +14 % depending on the scenario; and +4 % from agriculture (OP TGP-1, 2009).     Emissions from those bound by the EU-ETS system for the period 2008-2012 have been determined through the amount of rights to GHG emissions under the National Plan for Allocating Emission Coupons for 2008-2012. The average annual quantity of rights allocated to existing facilities in this period amounts to 8,168 kt CO2, while for new entries 131 kt CO2 of rights have been reserved. In total, emissions from EU-ETS sources amount to 8,299 kt CO2 equivalent. Based on projections, actual emissions from EU-ETS sources in 2008-2012 have been forecast at 9,514 kt CO2 equivalent. The difference or direct effect of EU-ETS equates to 1,215 kt CO2 equivalent.     Table 2 Comparison of actual emissions from EU-ETS sources and allocated rights based on the national plan for allocating emission coupons     After 2012, the EU-ETS scheme should include all existing sources from the period 2008-2012 plus additional sources involved in aluminium production. In order to determine emission rights after 2012, the annual quantity of rights in the period 2008-2012 was reduced each year by 1.74 %, using 2010 as the base year. Taking into account that emissions from sources in EU-ETS with allocated rights to GHG emissions are already determined, we may calculate from the total target a target for the period 2008-2012 for sources of emissions that are not included in EU-ETS. Fulfilment of the Kyoto obligations depends entirely on these sources. Taking into account sinks for fulfilling the Kyoto obligations, the average annual emissions from other sources in the period 2008-2012 would have to be lower than or equal to 11,747 kt CO2 equivalent.     Figure 6: Emission trends and projections of GHG emissions taking into account measures and additional measures, and comparison with Kyoto targets Source: ETS Report, 2009     Figure 7: GHG emissions to date by sector to 2007 and projections with measures to 2020 Source: OP TGP-1, 2009     What are the policy responses?     To achieve the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, Slovenia will use the system for trading GHG emissions, which cover about 44% of all emissions, enforce GHG emission sinks and the Kyoto flexible mechanisms.     For the purpose of reducing GHG emissions, Slovenia has taken steps under national operational program.     In 2002 Slovenia ratified the Kyoto Protocol and assumed the obligation to reduce GHG emissions in the period 2008-2012 on average by 8 % relative to the agreed emissions in 1986. To fulfil the obligations, Slovenia adopted measures and key instruments, which are defined in detail in the Operational Programme to Reduce GHG Emissions by 2012 (OP TGP-1, 2009). With the adoption of European legislation as part of the EU Climate-Energy Package, the importance of measures adopted within the operational programme is further enhanced, since consistent implementation of the planned measures to fulfil the Kyoto Protocol is an essential condition for fulfilment of the obligations of the Climate Energy Package legislation. In its essence, OP TGP-1 (2009) deals with the set of measures up until 2012, and their effect in reducing GHG emissions should also be clear in the period 2013-2020 (OP TGP-1, 2009).     The operational programme highlights, as urgently needed measures in the area of promoting high-efficiency, combined heat and power generation, use of renewable energy sources including a system of guaranteed purchase prices and financial incentives, co-natural development of transport by notifying consumers of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, taxing motor vehicles in respect of CO2 emissions, etc., co-natural waste management and measures tied to Slovenian Government measures to mitigate the consequences of the economic crisis \u2013 promoting efficient energy use in broad consumption, especially in the public sector and industry, through CO2 levies, GHG emission trading, etc. In particular, the OP TGP-1 stresses the exploitation of permitted quantities of sinks. If Slovenia is unable to justify the sinks, this would mean an additional shortfall in achieving the Kyoto targets amounting to 1,320 kt CO2 annually, and the urgent need to ensure additional funds for purchasing rights to GHG emissions amounting to \u20ac99 million (OP TGP-1, 2009).     By signing the Climate-Energy Package, Slovenia is committed to achieving the following goals:     9 % saving of end-use energy by 2016 relative to previous consumption (implementation of Directive 32\/2006\/EC on energy end-use efficiency and energy services);     increasing the proportion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources to 33.6 % of energy consumption by 2010 (Resolution on the National Energy Programme, ReNEP 2004 and Directive 2001\/77\/EC;     increasing the share of biofuels in accordance with the aims of Directive 2003\/30\/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport. The current Slovenian target is defined by the Decree on promoting the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels in transport (Uredba o pospe\u0161evanju uporabe biogoriv in drugih obnovljivih goriv v prometu), which sets out the proportion of the annual quantity of biofuels placed on the market to power motor vehicles, with the target raising it by 1 percentage point each year until 2010 and then by 0.5 percentage points annually up to 2015, when the target value is 7.5 % of the entire annual quantity of fuel placed on the market to power motor vehicles. Increases in GHG emissions will need to be limited to a maximum of 4 % by 2020 relative to 2005 in sectors that are not in the EU\u2013ETS \u2013 in other words for transport, broad consumption, waste, agriculture and small industrial plants. Emissions from plants that are in the ETS are exempted from the obligations of Member States, and their reduction is governed by the ETS on the EU level. The number is not yet final and will be adjusted in the light of changes to the selection of plants included in the ETS.     25 % of renewable energy sources in energy end-use by 2020;     at least a 10 % of energy products from renewable energy sources in the consumption of energy by motor vehicles (OP TGP-1, 2009).     In order to implement the domestic measures under OP TGP-1, in the period 2009-2012 the Slovenian Government will provide public funds amounting to \u20ac604.7 million. For Slovenia to fulfil its Kyoto Protocol obligations, in addition to financing the domestic measures defined in this document, in the period up to 2012 at least a further \u20ac80 million will be needed to purchase rights to GHG emissions amounting to 1.07 Mt CO2 equivalent a year, which, in the event of exceeding this, will have to be purchased on the international market. In order to ensure the funds, Slovenia envisages the introduction of an environmental tax on motor fuels of up to EUR 0.02\/l.     To achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets Slovenia will primarily use a system of trading in rights to GHG emissions, covering approximately 44 % of all emissions, sinks and Kyoto flexible mechanisms.     Kyoto flexible mechanisms have an influence chiefly on the electricity and heat generation sector, energy use in industry and construction and on industrial processes. Slovenia will need to make use of them, since the latest projections of emissions for the period 2008-2012 point to an excess of 1.10 Mt CO2 equivalent annually. Using Kyoto flexible mechanisms envisages the acquisition of emission coupons in one of the ways described below: - through the publication of a public call for applications for the sale of AAU (Assigned Amount Units) units through implementation of a joint investment project and, under an appropriate procedure as set out in the draft law, to conclude a contract on their purchase with the manager of the joint investment; - by purchasing assigned amount units (AAU) from a Kyoto Protocol party selling such units; - by purchasing ERU, CER or emission coupons (EUA) on the market (OP TGP-1, 2009).     Given the possibility of using forest sinks, Slovenia wishes in future to manage forests sustainably and exploit CO2 sinks. In accordance with the Marrakech Agreement, it can use forest sinks in the amount of 1,320 kt CO2 equivalent. The recent accumulation of wood stocks is the result of long-term concerted work in the forestry profession based on sustainability, a co-natural and multi-purpose approach, which is also the primary goal of the Resolution on the National Forestry Programme (ReNGP, 2007). Forest management, regardless of ownership, is steered by the Slovenian Forest Service. The greatest possible felling is determined in forest management plans covering a 10 year period \u2013 the last one ran 2001-2010. Under these plans, the highest possible felling is 4,050,000 m3\/year, but this is being raised. Accumulation of carbon in forests, a result of the planned increase in wood stocks, is a key element in claiming carbon sinks under the Kyoto Protocol. In order to show the increase in wood stocks, Slovenia will use the third level of difficulty (Tier 3). With this intention, a national inventory of the state of forests was carried out in 2007, and this must be repeated in 2012. Current data indicate that forests are actually accumulating three to four times more CO2 than Slovenia can exploit in achieving its Kyoto protocol obligations under resolution 11\/CP.7, 1.32 Mt CO2. Accumulation of CO2 in forests is just a temporary solution, since the stocks of carbon in forests cannot be increased ad infinitum. Upon balancing the flow of CO2 into and out of forests, over the longer term forests could undergo a shift and become a source of CO2 (OP TGP-1, 2009).     In relation to the priorities of climate change policy measures, Slovenia takes the view that in general special attention needs to be focused on those sectors where: - there is already a pronounced vulnerability to the current climate change potential, for example, agriculture which already has a sectoral strategy of adapting to climate change; - the current directions of development increase vulnerability to climate change, for example, urban development, use of the physical environment, etc.; - the period of adjustment is longest, and later changes in development are associated with the largest costs, for example, use of physical environment, infrastructure, forestry, urban development, building funds, etc. "

An important segment of the gallery program has always been exhibitions focusing on the town of Ljubljana, but now the angle has shifted slightly. While the traditional understanding saw Mestna galerija primarily as a venue for presentations of Ljubljana-based artists, our point of departure has, upon reconsideration, become the city as an architectural, urban, social, societal, and institutional fabric. This year\u2019s exhibition dedicated to Ljubljana is an overview of the Ljubljana digital media lab \u2013 Ljudmila.     Ljudmila\u2019s beginnings date back to 1994, when the World Wide Web was evolving: its activities included disseminating ideas and knowledge about the Internet, opening the first cyber caf\u00e9 in Eastern Europe in 1995, producing articles and publishing a journal, creating the first Internet portfolios for Slovenian artists and providing them with technical support in producing works, organizing workshops and lectures, encouraging participation in international conferences, and collaborating in founding NetTime \u2013 to briefly enumerate some of the highlights in Ljudmila\u2019s scope of operations. To list all of its pioneering achievements or all of the artworks produced by the creative minds of its many collaborators and sympathizers would be a tall order, so we have decided instead to present the main events on a timeline.     The exhibited artworks produced with the help of Ljudmila \u2013 hence the title of the show Powered by Ljudmila \u2013 are documents of a kind, testifying to seventeen years of work that represents an incubator of ideas, projects, knowledge, and concepts that are important for Ljubljana, Slovenia, and internationally.     The Internet Portfolio, a co-operation of Ljudmila (Ljubljana Digital Media Lab) and SCCA-Ljubljana, is taking part at the exhibition.     The exhibition presents as well the other projects of SCCA-Ljubljana, made in collaboration with Ljudmila: Videodokument (CD-ROM) and Marko Peljhan, U-COG-144 (Urban-Colonization Orientation Gear-144)(project in the framework of Urbanaria).     We are proud that the screening of Marko Peljahn video Ladomir \u00d8aktyra: First Surface \u2013 Mikrolab V1.0 was organized with the help of Diva Station, SCCA physical and web archive of video art.     The exhibition is on view until June 26, more information and the accompanying program is available here: "

Awards are granted on national and international level. Among the national winners for 2020 is LIFE CEPLAFIB project, coordinated by Slovenian research centre TECOS.     For the development of innovative and sophisticated recycling technologies on transforming the two post-consumer waste streams: plastic and newsprint paper, into new products applicable to packaging, automotive and construction sectors, TECOS received the prestigious National Energy Globe Award for Slovenia. The innovation potential of CEPLAFIB partnership arises from the novel circular economy approach of the recycling value chain that unites two diverse waste flows into new recycled composites that are sustainable and cost competitive. LIFE CEPLAFIB demonstrates how to combine the low value plastic waste with recovered fibres derived from newsprint paper waste with near to zero waste leftovers and how to transform them into high value-added products used in mass application sectors such as the automotive, caravanning, packaging and construction industries.     The project started in July 2018 and will be finished in June 2020. It is implemented by the Slovenian Tool and Die Development Centre \u2013 TECOS, in cooperation with the Slovenian company for recycling and processing of plastic granulates - OMAPLAST d.o.o. and ADRIA Mobil from Novo mesto, one of the leading European manufacturers of caravans, motorhomes and mobile homes. In addition to Slovenian participants, three international partners are additionally involved in the project, namely the Finnish waste paper recycling company - ECOPULP, the Polish National Building Research Institute - ITB and the development centre involved in plastic processing technologies - AITIIP from Spain.     With more than 182 participating countries and over 2000 project submissions annually the Energy Globe Award is today\u2019s most prestigious environmental prize worldwide. It distinguishes projects nationally and globally that conserve resources such as energy or utilize renewable or emission-free sources. By awarding prizes, they want to enhance the global attention to sustainable environmental solutions that can be used everywhere \u2013 and motivate people to become active in this field as well. "

      "text":" Fantastic image quality     SEL50F14Z 18.05.2019 od Jodek     I had my first shoot with this lens, along with my A7III and the images produced are absolutely beautiful. My model was over the moon with them. I would recommend this lens to any portrait photographer, whatever their experience.     Super Lens with a big flaw     SEL50F14Z 22.07.2020 od Drift     I was so happy with this lens until 2\/3's of the lens detached fell off and pulling out the two ribbon cables with no stress on the lens when it happened. I am so bummed this lens was incredible     Resolution on A7r ii is stunning     SEL50F14Z 08.05.2021 od Geo99     Bought this to complement my other prime lenses - the sharpness wide open is amazing. Whilst this is an expensive lens I made the purchase on the basis that it will suite the A7riv when I can afford to buy one.     Top Objektiv     SEL50F14Z 29.01.2021 od JHoKr     Vor dem Kauf ausgiebig andere Objektive gleicher Brennweite getestet. Blende 1,4 macht schon viel Spa\u00df!     A cracking lens in Manual mode!     SEL50F14Z 27.01.2021 od Reel     This lens is a superb, quality, solid 50mm I use on the A7s3 to film. BUT, the eye autofocus on this lens is crazy jittery. I have adjusted all settings on camera but have come to two conclusions. Either this lens is in dire need of a Firmware upgrade to work with the new AF in the Sony A7s3 or I have a faulty lens, which I need to get tested by Sony. Lock down has stopped me from doing so but I will once I get the chance. That problem a side this lens is a solid 50mm!!!     very noisy     SEL50F14Z 23.11.2020 od storm_33     i bought this lens, very expensive - the noise of the focusing motor makes it practically impossible to use for video     Super Lens with a big flaw     SEL50F14Z 22.07.2020 od Drift     I was so happy with this lens until 2\/3's of the lens detached fell off and pulling out the two ribbon cables with no stress on the lens when it happened. I am so bummed this lens was incredible     Dieses Objektiv nutze ich im Kontext meiner Selbstst\u00e4ndigkeit vornehmlich f\u00fcr Dokumentationsaufgaben, die in Verbindung mit dem Sony-Body a7RM4 exzellent zu l\u00f6sen sind. Die Abbildungsf\u00e4higkeiten dieses Objektivs sind hervorragend. Ich habe mich vor einiger Zeit f\u00fcr ein Sony-Equipment entschieden als Ersatz der zuvor genutzten Ausstattung des Herstellers mit dem roten Punkt. D.h., gemessen an dem vorherigen, hohen Qualit\u00e4tsstandard bei Objektiven bietet f\u00fcr mich Sony eine signifikante Steigerung und damit verbundenen relevanten Mehrwert an. Doch unabh\u00e4ngig von einen Einsatzzwecken eignet sich das Objektiv f\u00fcr zahlreiche Anwendungsfelder einschlie\u00dflich Portr\u00e4ts, sofern man mit den Personen vertraut ist und aus einer entsprechend nahen Distanz die Aufnahmen anfertigen kann. In diesem Fall l\u00e4sst sich ein ausgesprochen \u00e4sthetisch anspruchsvolles Bokeh erzeugen. Bekanntlich sprechen Bilder mehr als tausend Worte, deshalb gerne im Anhang Aufnahmen, die aus RAW-Versionen stammen, die dann mittels Capture One Pro in jpeg transformiert sind.     \u00dcberragende Bildqualit\u00e4t     SEL50F14Z 19.02.2020 od Patrick86     Das SEL50F14Z bietet hervorragende Bildqualit\u00e4t. Ich verwende es an einer A7R II und es macht gro\u00dfen Spa\u00df, sich die Bilder in der 100% Ansicht anzuschauen. Es soll auch eines der wenigen Objektive sein, die die hohe Aufl\u00f6sung der A7R IV ausreizen. Ich denke also, dass ich mit dem 50er f\u00fcr die Zukunft gut gewappnet bin. Das Objektiv ist, f\u00fcr ein 50er, schon ordentlich gro\u00df und schwer. Daf\u00fcr ist es hervorragend verarbeitet, bietet Autofokus und ist gegen Staub- und Spritzwasser gesch\u00fctzt. Aus diesen Gr\u00fcnden, und nat\u00fcrlich wegen der genialen Bildqualit\u00e4t, \u201eschleppe\u201c ich es gerne mit, wenn ich auf Fototour gehe. Den Preis finde ich angemessen.     Pfeilschnell und knackscharf     SEL50F14Z 29.12.2019     Ist genau so wie man sich ein objektiv vorstellt. Der Autofokus l\u00e4sst in Sachen Geschwindigkeit und Treffsicherheit keine W\u00fcnsche offen.     loud motor, WHY AREN'T THERE ANY REVIEWS ABOUT IT     SEL50F14Z 20.05.2019 od Elliotthowe     OK, so 1400 dollars lens right? right, should be made really well. I get it's big its large etc. but if it's supposedly the best on the market For Sony. should it not be silent AF. when it focuses, it makes a whirring noise.... like what, it should not make this noise, I called Sony and they told me that it shouldn't do this. however I went to my local camera shop and tried their lens, and it makes the same noise. so clearly it's just the lens, because it's moving so much heavy glass... put a better motor in it? like come on... so if you're looking for a dead silent focus this is not it.... aperture ring is also easily accidentally moved, which I find annoying     Fantastic image quality     SEL50F14Z 18.05.2019 od Jodek     I had my first shoot with this lens, along with my A7III and the images produced are absolutely beautiful. My model was over the moon with them. I would recommend this lens to any portrait photographer, whatever their experience.     Hochwertiges Produkt     SEL50F14Z 06.04.2019 od Joni2     + hochwertig verarbeitet + Blende 1.4 scharf genug + Blendering mit clicks (f\u00fcr Foto) oder stufenlos (f\u00fcr Video) + sch\u00f6nes Bokeh - etwas gro\u00df und schwer (w\u00fcnsche mir eine GM-Version nicht gr\u00f6\u00dfer und schwerer als das 24mm)     Gutes Normalobjektiv     SEL50F14Z 01.02.2019 od Tom__     Ich mag ja 50er Objektive und fotografiere gerne mit dieser Brennweite. Daher musste auch irgendwann das hochge\u00f6ffnete Sony 50mm ins Haus. Hab damit lange gewartet und nun festgestellt, dass ich es sehr oft verwende. Nicht nur zum Fotografieren, sondern auch zum Filmen und die beiden Blendenstufen mehr im Gegensatz zur Blende 2.8 machen oft den Mehrwert aus, denn die ISO rauscht doch schon bei 6400. Das Objektiv ist etwas gro\u00df geraten - dass sehe ich als einen Nachteil an - hier w\u00e4re sicher weniger m\u00f6glich, andere Hersteller zeigen dies. Die Fokussierung l\u00e4uft gut, wenn man sich an die indirekte Verstellung (elektronisch) erst einmal gew\u00f6hnt hat. Da ich nur noch native Sony-Objektive nutze, geht das mittlerweile. Der Blendenring ist sehr gut und auch den AF\/MF-Knopf verwende ich laufend.Leider vermisse ich den programmierbaren Knopf sehr, denn das Objektiv l\u00e4sst sich sehr gut als Portraitobjektiv verwenden. Sollte es mal ein GM mit dem Knopf geben, werde ich wechseln. Alles in allem aber ein sehr gutes Objektiv.     Lens Gives True To Life Pictures & Video     SEL50F14Z 15.01.2019 od Les864     I Just Purchased This Prime Lens And Found It To Be Brilliant For Creating Good Bokeh. I Will Be Using It Now For Stills & Video. Feels And Is Well Made     Sehr teuer, aber gute Bildqualit\u00e4t     SEL50F14Z 26.12.2018 od S666     Macht ein gutes Bild, allerdings im Vergleich zu Sigma etc viel zu teuer. Autofokus an der S7 ii im Videomodus leider unbrauchbar. Kann aber auch an der Kamera liegen.     Too heavy!     SEL50F14Z 24.08.2018 od emi2018     I bought this lens and it worked great with Sony A7iii, but returned it because it was too heavy along with the camera. I love Sony cameras...but the lens with bigger aperture are way too big and heavy. Could you make them a bit more portable? Thank you!!     Un bijou     SEL50F14Z 20.06.2018 od matouvu     Le r\u00e9sultat optique est excellent \u00e0 toutes les ouvertures. Enorm\u00e9ment de d\u00e9finition et un contraste bien nuanc\u00e9. Il n'est pas trop lourd pour une pareille ouverture et on l'a bien en mains.     The story so far     SEL50F14Z 27.04.2018 od willow walk     I purchased this lens a few weeks ago, I am not sure yet where this lens sits in my collection, too short for my liking in my studio for portrait work, too long for my commercial property work and too heavy in my opinion for street photography although this is where it excels, it has only had a couple of outings on the street so far and I have been blown away by the quality at all apertures, wide open for candid people shots can yield very good results with pleasing bokeh.     Macht sehr sch\u00f6ne Bokeh fotos     SEL50F14Z 31.03.2018 od Frederik1162     Das Objektiv macht sehr sch\u00f6ne Bokeh Fotos und die Einrastefunktion f\u00fcr die Blendenwerte ist sehr praktisch, damit der eingestellte Wert nicht verrutscht. Einzige Verbesserungsm\u00f6glichkeit w\u00e4re das Einrasten auf Autamtische Blendenwahl fester zu machen als die anderen. Aber das ist Kritik auf sehr hohem Niveau. PS.: Die Sch\u00e4rfe des Objektivs ist echt extrem gut (ich nehme es h\u00e4ufiger statt mein 24-105 f4 und croppe...)     Perfect     SEL50F14Z 07.06.2017 od Sup3r     50mm is my favorite focal length. It's very versatile and great for travel, street photography and portraits. The images I get from this lens is truly amazing with very good sharpness throughout the frame, especially the center, even when shot wide open. CA is controlled well, distortion is almost non-existent and while there is obvious vignetting at f\/1.4, it doesn't bother because it's correctable in Lightroom. The build quality is amazing. I love the aperture control ring that Sony has been adding with their current lenses and the focusing ring is super smooth. The AF\/MF switch is such a welcomed addition as well. Overall, if money is no object, and you're looking for a bokehlicious lens with excellent light-gathering capability, this is the way to go. Albeit it's more expensive and larger than both the 50mm f1.8 and 55mm f1.8, it's really the best native 50mm lens for the FE mount I have used to date. It's permanently affixed on to my A7II.     Simply Stunning!!!     SEL50F14Z 26.05.2017 od Stephen5393     Ever since my purchase (January this year), it has become the Best companion in every photo sessions. Portrait\/studio, as well as outside and street shots are just stunning!! Light intake is phenomenal, extremely sharp and well balanced. Feels good (with exception of its a bit heavy weight) and looks lovely. I use it with A7II body, ..and it enhances the camera body\/look(!). (Do get lots of compliments!) Premium quality. ..and yes, 11 blade makes stunning bokeh.     Einfach scharfe Bilder     SEL50F14Z 22.05.2017 od galon791     Das Objektiv hat eine \"Normale\" Brennweite deshalb von Ausschnitt her gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig ansonsten sind die Fotos scharf, bzw sehr scharf!     Gutes Glas, aber nicht perfekt     SEL50F14Z 01.05.2017     Das Objektiv bildet im Zentrum schon bei Offenblende sehr scharf ab. Es neigt jedoch etwas zu CA's, jedoch nicht sehr stark. F\u00fcr ein 50er Glas ist das Objektiv recht gro\u00df und schwer, Das Bokeh empfinde ich als sehr sch\u00f6n. Die Verarbeitung ist hervorragend und macht einen hochwertingen Eindruck. Es l\u00e4sst sich wunderbar auch manuell fokussieren, die M\u00f6glichkeit die Blende manuell einzustellen m\u00f6chte ich nicht mehr missen.     Lichtstark und scharf!     SEL50F14Z 10.02.2017 od Laotu     Das Objektiv ist sehr lichtstark mit einer ausgezeichneten Abbildungsqualit\u00e4t. Der Autofokus l\u00e4uft leise und pr\u00e4zise. Gef\u00fchlt k\u00f6nnte er manchmal etwas schneller sein. Das Gewicht ist f\u00fcr ein 50mm schon recht hoch und auf einer A7 Kamera wirkt das Objektiv fast schon zu gross. Daf\u00fcr ist die Materialqualit\u00e4t super.     Excellent lens     SEL50F14Z 17.09.2016 od A doctor     Looks and feels great. Premium quality. Very well ballanvlced on A7rii and amazingly quick and silent focus. 11 blade makes bokeh look stunning. Very sharp and bright. Great contrast. An amust lens for a7rii and a7sii.     Endlich ein \u201erichtiges 1,4\/50 mit Zeiss-Popp     SEL50F14Z 12.09.2016     Das Objektiv ist zwar recht m\u00e4chtig f\u00fcr ein 50er, mit der A7RII dennoch eine ausgewogene Combo. Die IQ ist erstklassig von Rand zu Rand,bereits bei Offenblende. Verarbeitung Zeisslike, MF l\u00e4uft sauber und pr\u00e4zise.

The Eurosystem aims at euro inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.     The Bank of Slovenia co-designs, implements and oversees a system of prudential rules for safe and sound operations by banks and savings banks, and ensures financial stability through the regular monitoring and analysis of banks.     Payment systems and securities settlement systems (settlement systems) are an important part of the economic and financial infrastructure, which allow for the transfer of funds and financial instruments between participants in payment and settlement systems.     Euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in Slovenia. The Bank of Slovenia ensures that the Slovenian market is supplied with authentic and fit currency, exchanges tolar banknotes and damaged euro banknotes, and sells commemorative and collector coins to collectors and other members of the public.     The Bank of Slovenia releases a range of publications covering its areas of activity. The focus is on analysis of the performance of the banking system, forecasts of economic developments, monitoring of direct investment, and international economic relations.

Alexander Casteels in Cornelis de Wael, dva slikarja bitk v Stari galeriji De\u017eelnega muzeja Joanneum v Gradcu (Alte Galerie am Landesmuseum Joanneum)     V gra\u0161ki galeriji starih mojstrov smo pred nedavnim posvetili novo raziskavo upodobitvam bitk flamskih in holandskih slikarjev. V \u010dasu pozne renesanse so bila glavni vir navdiha dela Antonia Tempeste. Bil je pod mo\u010dnim Vasarijevim vplivom in je dobro poznal na\u010din upodabljanja dramati\u010dnih dogajanj all\u2019antica iz 16. stoletja. Z njegovimi splo\u0161no znanimi grafikami, s katerimi je utrdil tovrstne vzorce, so si lahko pomagali celo manj nadarjeni slikarji. Med njimi je bil flamski slikar Alexander Casteels, \u010digar bitke all\u2019antica se zgledujejo po Tempestovih delih. Veliko platno, hranjeno v Gradcu, lahko kot rezultat novej\u0161ih raziskav zdaj pripi\u0161emo temu slikarju. Antwerpenski slikar Cornelis de Wael si je pridobil ugled z upodobitvami spopadov, ki so blizu realizmu. Cornelis je igral pomembno vlogo v Genovi kot posrednik in trgovec z umetninami in je bil klju\u010dna oseba za svojega prijatelja, danes veliko bolj slavnega Anthonisa van Dycka.     \"Battaglia\" and \"gevecht\". Alexander Casteels and Cornelis de Wael, two painters of battles at the Alte Galerie am Landesmuseum Joanneum, Graz, Austria     Recently, new research has been done on battle paintings by Flemish and Dutch masters in Graz. In the late Renaissance, the works of Antonio Tempesta formed a major source. Deeply influenced by Vasari, he was familiar with the 16th century manner of dramatic actions all\u2019antica. Due to his well-known graphic works where all these patterns had been laid down, even less talented painters were able to exploit them. Among these was Alexander Casteels, a Fleming by birth. His battles all\u2019antica go back on Tempesta\u2019s models. A large canvas on stock in Graz can now be attributed to him. The Antwerp painter Cornelis de Wael gained a reputation for skirmish paintings close to realism. Cornelis played an important role in Genoa as networker and art dealer and was a key figure to his personal friend much more renowned today: Anthony van Dyck.     Bla\u017eenka FIRST     Flamsko izhodi\u0161\u010de za poznomanieristi\u010dno sliko Sv. Fran\u010di\u0161ek v ekstazi. Poskus atribucije slikarju Janezu Kochu     Novome\u0161kega slikarja Janeza Kocha (1650\u20131715) poznamo le po zapu\u0161\u010dini risb, hranjeni v zagreb\u0161ki Metropolitaski biblioteki (Valvasorjeva grafi\u010dna zbirka Zagreb\u0161ke nad\u0161kofije).

Fran\u010di\u0161ka Asi\u0161kega v refektoriju novome\u0161kega fran\u010di\u0161kanskega samostana. Arhivsko gradivo, primejava z njegovimi signiranimi risbami in grafi\u010dna predloga, ki jo je posedoval tudi Kochov delodajalec Valvasor, eventualno potrjujejo postavljeno hipotezo. Prizor je posnet po grafi\u010dni predlogi iz antwerpenske grafi\u010dne delavnice in zalo\u017ebe Raphaela Sadelerja I., ta pa je posnetek likovne invencije sienskega mojstra Francesca Vannija.     Flemish Sources for a Late Mannerist Painting of St Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy     A Tentative Attribution to Johannes Koch     Johannes Koch (1650\u20131715), a painter of Novo mesto, is known only as the author of a set of preliminary drawings for the engravings in the books of the Carniolan polyhistor Johann Weichard Baron Valvasor (The Valvasor Collection of the Zagreb Archdiocese, Metropolitan Library, Zagreb). Still unknown is his painted oeuvre; Koch's authorship can be supposed in the case of the oil painting of St Francis in Ecstasy from the refectory of the Novo mesto Franciscan monastery. This thesis can possibly be confirmed by the archival material, by a comparison to Koch's signed drawings, and by the print model once owned by his commissioner Valvasor. The scene itself has been modelled after an engraving of the Antwerpen graphic workshop and publishing house of Raphael Sadeler I, which in turn had been copied after an invention by the Sienese painter and print-maker Francesco Vanni.     Gerlinde GRUBER     Janos in Sara Rovin \u2013 pozabljena slika iz zbirke cesarja Karla VI. in njen slikar Carolus Unterhuber     Slika Janos in Sara Rovin (sign. Carolus Unterhuber, dat. 1695) je \u017eanrski portret zakonskega para, ki naj bi bil po napisu na sliki poro\u010den 147 let in naj bi \u017eivel v Szadovi pri Temi\u0161varu. Ker je bil napis v preteklosti popravljen, datacija slike ni zanesljiva. Leta 1720 je izpri\u010dana v dunajski cesarski zbirki in je bila tedaj prva slika, ki jo je lahko videl obiskovalec galerije. Zakonski par Rovin so prav v dvajsetih letih 18. stoletja vedno znova navajali kot primer dolgega \u017eivljenja, obstajalo pa je ve\u010d variant tega portreta, tudi v grafiki. Istemu avtorju lahko pripi\u0161emo \u0161e dve \u017eanrski sliki: Staro \u017eensko s koko\u0161jo in Starega mo\u0161kega s pti\u010di.     S temi deli se Carolus Unterhuber uvr\u0161\u010da v vrsto srednjeevropskih \u017eanrskih slikarjev, katerih delo ka\u017ee povezave z lombardskim \u017eanrskim slikarstvom in ki delujejo na mejnem podro\u010dju med \u017eanrskim in portretnim slikarstvom, lahko pa bi ga tudi identificirali s Karlom Jakobom Unterhuberjem (1700\u20131752), ki je bil sicer znan predvsem po sakralnih podobah in freskah.     Janos and Sara Rovin: Forgotten Painting from the Collection of Emperor Charles VI and its Author Carolus Unterhuber     The painting Janos and Sara Rovin (signed: Carolus Unterhuber, dated 1695) is a genre portrait of a couple who were, according to the inscription in the painting, married for 147 years and lived in Szadova near Timi\u015foara (present-day Romania). Due to later interventions in the inscription, the date is unreliable. In 1720 the painting was documented in Viennese imperial collection and it was then the first work that could be seen by the visitors of the gallery. The Rovins were in the 1720s often used as an example of longevity, and several versions of the portrait existed, including prints. Two other genre paintings, Old Woman with a Hen and Old Man with Birds can be attributed to the same painter.     With these paintings, Carolus Unterhuber can be placed in the group of Central-European genre painters whose works reveal relations with Lombard genre painting and combine elements of genre painting and portraiture. The painter can tentatively be identified with Karl Jakob Unterhuber (1700\u20131752), who is generally better known for religious motifs and frescoes.     Herbert HAUPT     Pregled flamskih in nizozemskih umetnikov na dunajskem dvoru v 17. in 18. stoletju     Predstavljeni so nizozemski in flamski umetniki in obrtniki, ki so se od srede 17. stoletja do prve polovice 18. stoletja priselili na Dunaj oziroma dunajski dvor. Tri \u010detrtine od 99 umetnikov in rokodelcev je bilo slikarjev, zlatarjev oziroma draguljarjev, bakrorezcev in \u0161ivalcev biserov, torej so bili zaposleni le v \u0161tirih poklicih, ena \u010detrtina pa je opravljala 15 drugih poklicev. Znotraj nekak\u0161ne nizozemsko-flamske \u00bbkolonije\u00ab umetnikov so vzdr\u017eevali stike med seboj (botrstvo, pri\u010de na porokah), posameznikom pa je lahko s poroko uspelo prodreti tudi v kroge dunajskega plemstva. Pri posameznih dru\u017einah je pri\u0161lo do oblikovanja pravih dinastij, saj sta dejavnost in znotraj poklica pridobljen status prehajala iz roda v rod. Arhivske raziskave so prinesle \u0161tevilna nova imena in pa tudi nove podatke o \u017eivljenju in delu tistih nizozemskih in flamskih umetnikov in rokodelcev, ki so bili v strokovni literaturi \u017ee omenjeni.     Overview of Flemish and Dutch Artists at Viennese Court in the 17th and 18th Centuries     The essay discusses a number of Dutch and Flemish artists and craftsmen who moved to Vienna, or even gained access to Viennese court, in the period from the mid-17th to the first half of the 18th century. 75 percent of the 99 artists and craftsmen were painters, jewellers, engravers and pearl sewers, which amounts to four different professions, whereas the remaining quarter belonged to as many as 15 other professions. They kept in touch (godparents, witnesses to a marriage) by forming a sort of a Dutch-Flemish \u201ccolony\u201d of artists. However, by way of marriage, some of them managed to make their way to the circles of Viennese nobility. Individual families developed into real dynasties, as the activity and the status obtained in the profession were passed on from generation to generation. Archival researches have resulted in a number of new names as well as further information about the life and work of the already known artists and craftsmen.     Andrej HIRCI     Multispectral Analysis of Paintings from the Second Half of the 17th Century in Carniola     The essay introduces the results of the multispectral analysis of the paintings displayed at the exhibition Almanach and Painting in the Second Half of the 17th Century in Carniola. The structure of paint layers, the results of optical examination (UVF and IRR) and the chemical composition of the materials confirmed the relation between The Card Players I, The Card Players II, A Young Man with a Turkey and Portrait of a Nobleman.     Multispektralna analiza slik iz druge polovice 17. stoletja na Kranjskem     V prispevku so predstavljeni rezultati preiskav slik, vklju\u010denih na razstavo Almanach in slikarstvo druge polovice 17. stoletja na Kranjskem, z multispektralno analizo. Na\u010din gradnje barvnih plasti, analiza opti\u010dnih preiskav in sorodna kemi\u010dna sestava materialov ka\u017eejo na povezavo med slikami Kvartopirci I, Kavrtopirci II, De\u010dek s puranom in Mo\u0161ki portret.     Petr INGERLE     Med deskriptivnim in narativnim. Justus van den Nypoort in njegovo delovanje v Salzburgu in Olomucu     \u010clanek se ukvarja z vlogo, ki jo je imela na moravsko baro\u010dno umetnost raznolika umetnostna dejavnost potujo\u010dega nizozemskega umetnika Justusa van den Nypoorta (Utrecht 1645\/1649\u2013po 1698). V njegovem delu je opazno nasprotje med severnja\u0161kim ali deskriptivnim modelom upodabljanja in ju\u017eno retori\u010dno tradicijo (kot je to metodolo\u0161ko utemeljila Svetlana Alpers). Svoj pozni opus je Nypoort ustvaril na Moravskem v slu\u017ebi olomu\u0161kega \u0161kofa Karla II iz dru\u017eine Liechtenstein-Castelcorn. V grafikah in slikah, ki so se ohranile na gradu Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e, se nam Nypoort ka\u017ee kot predstavnik kme\u010dkega \u017eanra. \u010clanek opozarja na druga dela za \u0161kofa Liechtensteina, kot so ilustracije \u0161kofijskega koledarja, \u0161kofove insignije, grafi\u010dni album vedut of krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e\u0161kega cvetli\u010dnega vrta, imenovanega Libosad, in \u0161e na nekaj neohranjenih del, znanih le iz arhivskih virov. Predstavljenih je tudi nekaj novih odkritij na podro\u010dju Nypoortovega monumentalnega oltarnega slikarstva. Sklepni del je posve\u010den dvema knjigama emblemov salzbur\u0161kega benediktinca Parisa Gilla: prva je apologija \u0161kofa Karla II Liechtenstein-Castelcornskega, druga pa je pomembna predvsem zaradi Nypoortovega avtorstva slikovnega dela.     Between the \u201cdescriptive\u201d and the \u201cnarrative\u201d. Justus van den Nypoort and his work in Salzburg and Olomouc     The article deals with the role played by a diverse artistic activity of a wandering Netherlandish artist Justus van den Nypoort (1645\/1649 Utrecht \u2013 after 1698) in the Baroque art of Moravia. The antinomy of the artistic roles is noted, with which the artist had to cope with through the reference to the dichotomy between the northern or \u201cdescriptive\u201d depiction model and the southern rhetoric tradition, i.e. the methodological approach previously used by Svetlana Alpers. Late in his life, Nypoort worked in Moravia in the service of the Olomouc bishop Charles II of Liechtenstein-Castelcorn. In his engravings and several paintings preserved at the chateau in Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e, Nypoort appears as a representative of the \u201cpeasant genre\u201d. The article adverts to other works for Liechtenstein, such as the illustrations for the diocesan calendar, bishop\u2019s insignia, album of graphic views of the Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e pleasance \u201cLibosad\u201d and some works not preserved, known only from archive sources. It features also the recent findings concerning Nypoort's work on the monumental altar painting. The conclusion is dedicated to two emblematic books by Salzburg Benedictine Paris Gille: one represents an apology of bishop Charles II of Liechtenstein-Castelcorn, the other is appreciable mainly for the fact that Nypoort is the author of its pictorial section.     Tina KO\u0160AK     Almanachovi Kvartopirci v slogovnem in ikonografskem kontekstu nizozemsko-flamskega slikarstva 17. stoletja     Za slogovno in ikonografsko analizo Almanachovih Kvartopircev I in II je raziskovanje njunega konteksta v nizozemsko-flamskem \u017eanrskem slikarstvu 17. stoletja klju\u010dnega pomena. Sliki ka\u017eeta sorodnost z dvema razli\u010dnima slikarskima usmeritvama: caravaggizmom in kme\u010dkim \u017eanrom. Medtem ko se Almanach slogovno pribli\u017ea severnja\u0161kim caravaggistom, je izhodi\u0161\u010da za nekatere vsebinske poudarke na Kvartopircih mo\u010d iskati v veselih dru\u017ebah Brouwerjevega in Molenaerjevega tipa. Tak je tudi motiv kvartopirca, ki s karto v rokah pogleduje proti gledalcu. Kljub naslonu na antwerpenski in utrechtski caravaggizem pa se Almanach oddalji od ostrih svetlobnih kontrastov in grobih tipov figur. Njegovo slogovno izhodi\u0161\u010de lahko zato i\u0161\u010demo v skupini poznih severnja\u0161kih caravaggistov, ki so na Nizozemskem in Flamskem delovali v drugi polovici 17. stoletja.     Almanach\u2019s Card Players in Stylistic and Iconographic Context of Dutch and Flemish 17th Century Painting     The article deals with Almanach's paintings The Card Players I and II within the context of Dutch and Flemish 17th century painting. Two different types of card-playing scenes are discussed as the source for Almanach's works: Caravaggesque paintings and low-life scenes. While in The Card Players I and II Almanach formally follows the characteristics of Caravaggism, he includes in his paintings several iconographic patterns which appear more frequently in merry-making tavern interiors. Such is also a figure with a card who faces the viewer. Although in close relation with Antwerp and Utrecht Caravaggists, Almanach distances stylistically from rough renderings of figures and sharp contrasts of light and dark. In the subdued realization of Caravaggism, both of The Card Players strongly resemble the style of late Caravaggisti active in the second half of the 17th century.     Ana LAVRI\u010c     Slika Marijinega vnebovzetja v Novi \u0160tifti pri Ribnici v lu\u010di Sch\u00f6nlebnove mariologije in Almanachovega slikarstva     \u010clanek ugotavlja, da je slika iz Nove \u0160tifte nastala v zadnji tretjini 17. stoletja pod vplivom slavnega mariologa, tedanjega ribni\u0161kega \u017eupnika Janeza Ludvika Sch\u00f6nlebna (1618\u20131681). Ta je v svojih spisih branil nauk o Marijinem brezmade\u017enem spo\u010detju in se ostro spopadal z dominikanci. Argumenti, s katerimi je nauk utemeljeval, na\u010din, kako je opisoval Brezmade\u017eno, ter gore\u010dnost, s katero je spodbujal pape\u017ea k razglasitvi dogme, so poudarki, ki jih je mogo\u010de zaznati na na\u0161i sliki (ta se motivno sicer ve\u017ee na patrocinij cerkve). Njene posebnosti so zlasti poudarjena povezava z Apokalipti\u010dno \u017eeno, pretvorba Vnebovzetja v Vnebohod, Marijina triumfalisti\u010dna dr\u017ea in pove\u010dano \u0161tevilo gledalcev prizora, kar nakazuje odlo\u010dilno vlogo ljudstva pri potrditvi nauka (consensus fidelium). V liku disputirajo\u010dih mo\u017e prepoznavamo Sch\u00f6nlebna in pape\u017ea Klemena IX.; prekri\u017eani klju\u010di sv. Petra namre\u010d nedvoumno aludirajo na pape\u0161ke insignije in oblast. Ker ka\u017ee slika ve\u010d sorodnosti z Almanachovimi Kvartopirci, bo pomemben \u010dlen pri nadaljnjem ugotavljanju njegovega opusa in pri preu\u010devanju slikarstva druge polovice 17. stoletja na Kranjskem.     The Nova \u0160tifta Altarpiece of the Assumption of the Virgin in the light of Sch\u00f6nleben's Marian Studies and Almanach's Work as a Painter     The paper reveals that the altarpiece of Nova \u0160tifta from the last third of the 17th century was made under the influence of the famous scholar in Marian studies and the then parish priest in Ribnica, Johann Ludwig Sch\u00f6nleben (1618\u20131681). In his writings he defended the belief in Mary's immaculate conception and he engaged in fierce controversy with the Dominicans. His arguments in favour of his belief, the way he described the Immaculate and the zeal with which he encouraged the pope to proclaim the dogma \u2013 all of these can be traced in this altarpiece (as to the motif, however, it is related to the patron saint of the church). It is peculiar especially for its emphasis laid on the connection of the Immaculate with the Apocalyptic Woman, the transformation of the Assumption into the Ascension, the Virgin's triumphant posture and the increased number of the attendance, which points to the decisive role of the faithful in the sanctioning of the belief (consensus fidelium). In the two men engaged in a dispute we can recognize Sch\u00f6nleben and Pope Clement IX; the crossed keys of St. Peter clearly allude to papal insignia and authority. As the painting shows several similarities with Almanach's Cardplayers, it will be a significant link in the future ascertaining of his oeuvre and in the research into the painting of the second half of the 17th century in Carniola.     Jure MIKU\u017d     The image of the Fly as Representation, Sign, Symbol, and Trademark     In the painting In the Kitchen, the black cat on the window\u2019s pane observes the interior. A bottle is complemented with displaced pairs of eggs and turnips. The dead hen spreads its legs and the erotic tension is emphasized below with the mushroom\u2019s separated stipe, the onions and the asparagus. On the meat landed a fly: one is supposed to believe that the chunk is a real one and has attracted the fly. The painted fly openly declares itself as a visual and as a semantic intruder. Arrested in the action, it is a possible constituent of the factual and of the depicted reality. As an illusionist trick introduces the sense of the fugitive in the static sense of painting. For the pictorial composition, it represents the spot which disturbs visual harmony and has several meanings as representation, sign, symbol, and trademark.     Podoba muhe kot reprezentacija, znak, simbol in za\u0161\u010ditni znak     Na sliki V kuhinji \u010drna ma\u010dka z okenske police opazuje notranj\u0161\u010dino. \u0160trle\u010do pletenko dopolnjujejo preme\u0161\u010deni pari jajc in repe. Mrtva koko\u0161 je raz\u0161irila bedra, eroti\u010dno napetost \u0161e poudarjajo odtrgani bet gobe, \u010debula in \u0161op belu\u0161ev. Na mesu je pristala muha; gledalec mora verjeti, da je meso pravo in da je z vonjem pritegnilo muho. V umetnosti naslikana muha pogosto predstavlja vizualno in pomensko vsiljivko na platnu. Zaustavljena v letu je mo\u017ena sestavina prave in odslikane resni\u010dnosti. Je iluzionisti\u010dna ukana, ki ustvarja minljivost v stati\u010dnem ob\u010dutju podobe. V slikovni kompoziciji predstavlja made\u017e, ki zmoti vizualno harmonijo in ima mnogo pomenov kot reprezentacija, znak, simbol in za\u0161\u010ditni znak.     Christiane MORSBACH     \u017danrske slike na Dunaju in v njegovi okolici delujo\u010dih nizozemskih in flamskih priseljencev Jana van Ossenbeecka (1624\u20131674), Jana Thomasa (1617\u20131678), Johanna de Cordua (ok. 1630?\u20131698\/1702?) in Jacoba Toorenvlieta (1635\u20131719)     Predstavljena so \u017eanrska dela slikarjev Jana van Ossenbeecka iz Rotterdama, Jana Thomasa iz Ypresa, Johanna de Cordue iz Bruslja in Jacoba Toorenvlieta iz Leidna na Dunaju v drugi polovici 17. stoletja. Ugotovljeni so vplivi Davida Teniersa mlaj\u0161ega, Adriaena van Ostadea ali Cornelia Pietersz. Bega ter Martina Dichtla. Med pomembnej\u0161imi naro\u010dniki omenjenih slikarjev so bili mdr. cesar Leopold I. in njegov stric Leopold Viljem, Ferdinand Bonaventura I. grof Harrach, Karl Eusebius knez Lichtensteinski in njegov sin Janez Adam Andrej.     Genre Paintings by Netherlandish Artists Working in Vienna and its Vicinity: Jan van Ossenbeeck (1624\u20131674), Jan Thomas (1617\u20131678), Johann de Cordua (c. 1630?\u20131698\/1702?) and Jacob Toorenvliet (1635\u20131719)     The essay discusses the genre works of the painters Jan van Ossenbeeck from Rotterdam, Jan Thomas from Ypres, Johann de Cordua from Brussels and Jacob Toorenvliet from Leiden, who worked in Vienna in the second half of the 17th century. They were influenced by David Teniers II, Adriaen van Ostade, Cornelis Pietersz. Bega and Martin Dichtl. Among the most important patrons of the above mentioned painters were also Emperor Leopold I and his uncle Leopold Wilhelm, Ferdinand Bonaventura I Count Harrach, Karl Eusebius Prince of Lichtenstein and his son Johann Adam Andreas.     Ivo NEMEC, Katja KAVKLER, Andreja DE GLERIA     Slike pripisane Almanachu in Hermanu Verelstu: materiali in tehnike     V \u010dlanku so predstavljene analize materialov in tehnike izbranih slik iz opusov na Kranjskem delujo\u010dih slikarjev druge polovice 17. stoletja, \u0161e posebej dela Almanacha in Harmana Verelsta. Uporabljene so bile rentgenska radiografija (RTG), opti\u010dna in elektronska mikroskopija (OM; SEM-EDX) ter histokemijsko barvanje presekov barvnih plasti. Podloge slik so bile praviloma rde\u010de ali rjave in so vsebovale \u017eelezove gline, same ali v zmesi z gorsko kredo. Vezivo podlog je bilo praviloma oljno. Paleta je bila skromna, vsebovala je kostno \u010drno in svin\u010devo glajenko \u2013 masikot. Barve so bile praviloma nanesene enoslojno, ker so bili toni barv zame\u0161ani \u017ee na paleti. Redkeje so bile barve izdelane v ve\u010d slojih. Pentimentov prakti\u010dno ni, zaslediti pa je na Kranjskem sicer redko izdelavo kompozicije s slojem podloge ali barve \u2013 mrtve barve.     Na podlagi analiz je bilo potrjeno, da so delo enega avtorja oziroma delavnice slike De\u010dek s puranom, Kvartopirci I in Kvartopirci II. Z njimi pa na podlagi materialno \u2013 tehnolo\u0161kih zna\u010dilnosti ne moremo povezati preostalih analiziranih del, zato tudi ni bilo mogo\u010de potrditi domneve o identifikaciji slikarja Almanacha s Hermanom Verelstom.     The Paintings Attributed to Almanach and Herman Verelst: Materials and Techniques     The paper presents the analysis of materials and techniques of the paintings from the second half of 17th century in Carniola. They were examined by x-rays, optical and electronic microscopy (OM and SEM-EDX) and histochemical dyeing of the colour layers cross-sections. Painters of the period used red or brown grounds, which contained iron clays or mixture of iron clays and mountain chalk. As a binding of ground they usually used oil. The set of pigments is modest, but it contains bone black and massicot. Colours are generally applied in one layer, which shows that they were mixed on palette before application. Only in few cases we have found colours composed in several layers. There are practically no pentimenti. Quite exceptional for Carniola is also preparation of composition with additional layer of ground or colour (dead colour).     The findings confirm that A Young Man with a Turkey, The Card Players I and The Card Players II are works of the same author or his workshop. On the other hand, the characteristics of materials and technologies used for other paintings were different, therefore the identification of Almanach with Herman Verelst could not be confirmed.     Milan PELC     \u0160ala, satira in alegorija na nem\u0161kih ilustriranih letakih 17. stoletja in njihov globlji pomen (primeri iz Valvasorjeve zbirke v Zagrebu)     Pri\u010dujo\u010di prispevek za simpozij o Almanachu in njegovem \u010dasu se navezuje na avtorjev \u010dlanek, objavljen v Acta historiae artis Slovenica, 8, 2003, in ob\u0161irneje spregovori o eni izmed tematskih skupin, ki so tam le na kratko opisane. Obravnava namre\u010d ilustrirane letake \u0161aljive vsebine, katerih naloga ni bila le zabavati ljudi, temve\u010d pozitivno vplivati na njihova stali\u0161\u010da glede vpra\u0161anj zasebne in javne morale. Ti letaki so sestavni del kulturolo\u0161kega diskurza 17. st., ki je potekal na razli\u010dnih komunikacijskih ravneh, od knji\u017eevnosti in moralne teologije do slikovne publicistike. Njihova predstavitev raz\u0161irja vpogled v likovni in komunikacijski okvir, v katerem je s svojimi deli na elitni ravni sodeloval tudi Almanach.     Humour, Satire and Allegory on German Illustrated Broadsheets of the 17th Century and Their Deeper Meaning (Examples from the Valvasor Collection in Zagreb)     The present paper, prepared for the symposium about the painter Almanach and his time, refers to the article published by the author in Acta historiae artis Slovenica, 8, 2003, and it deals in detail with one of the thematic groups treated there only briefly. Namely, it discusses illustrated broadsheets of humorous content, whose task was not only to amuse the recipients but also to exert a positive impact on their stance toward the questions of private and public morals. These broadsheets are a constituent part of the culturological discourse of the 17th century that was going on at various communication levels, from literature and moral theology to pictorial publications. The present study of these broadsheets broadens the insight into the visual and communication context within which Almanach participated on an elite level.     Erwin POKORNY     Neznane risbe Davida Teniersa mlaj\u0161ega iz Valvasorjeve zbirke     Do leta 1685 je Janezu Vajkardu Valvasorju uspelo zbrati pomembno zbirko risb, od katerih jih ve\u010d kakor \u0161estdeset lahko pripi\u0161emo Davidu Teniersu II. in njegovi delavnici. Tretjina risb predstavlja krajinske motive, figuralni prizori pa so ve\u010dinoma ponovitve posameznih uspe\u0161nih invencij. \u0160tevilne med njimi so povezane s slikarskimi realizacijami. V nasprotju s \u0161tudijami so ponovitve ve\u010djih figur praviloma natan\u010dno sen\u010dene, kar pa ne pomeni, da niso Teniersovo lastnoro\u010dno delo. Med pogojnimi atribucijami slikarju je vredna posebne pozornosti edina ohranjena skica za njegovo slikarsko upodobitev galerije nadvojvode Leopolda Viljema.     Unknown drawings by David Teniers the Younger in the Valvasor Collection     By 1685 Johann Weichard Valvasor had brought together a notable collection of drawings. More than 60 of them can be attributed to David Teniers II and his workshop. A third of them are landscape drawings. The majority of the figure drawings are repetitions of single compositional motifs. Many of them are connected with paintings. Unlike the figure studies the repetitions display elaborate hatchings, which however should not be taken as an argument against their autograph status. Among the tentative attributions to Teniers the following deserves particularly close attention: the only surviving sketch for a painting of the gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm.     Mirjana REPANI\u0106-BRAUN     Slikarstvo 17. stoletja v severni Hrva\u0161ki \u2013 obrobno poglavje zgodnjebaro\u010dnega slikarstva     Slikarstvo druge polovice 17. stoletja v severni Hrva\u0161ki je v okviru srednjeevropskega slikarstva obrobnega pomena. Brez vidnih imen in brez pomembnih del doma\u010dih slikarjev je v bistvenih zna\u010dilnostih sorodno slikarstvu sosednjih de\u017eel oziroma njihovih umetnostnih sredi\u0161\u010d, vplivi pa so se pretakali zlasti prek naro\u010dil ali uvo\u017eenih del tujih umetnikov, kot so bili Hans Georg Geigerfeld, Ivan Eisenhordt in Hans Adam Weissenkircher.     17th Century Painting in North Croatia \u2013 A Minor Episode of Early Baroque Painting     The painting of the second half of the 17th century plays a minor role of the Central European Baroque painting. With no outstanding protagonists and no significant works of local painters it shares the essential features with the neighboring countries and the painting of their artistic centers mostly through the commissioned and imported paintings of foreign authors like Hans Georg Geigerfeld, Ivan Eisenhordt or Hans Adam Weissenkircher.     Michele TAVOLA     Federico Zeri in Almanachova fortuna critica     V prispevku so predstavljene slovenske \u0161tudije velikega italijanskega poznavalca Federica Zerija od sedemdesetih do konca devetdesetih let 20. stoletja. \u0160e posebej je poudarjen njihov pomen za razumevanje Almanacha, ki je bil verjetno najpomembnej\u0161i, a tudi najskrivnostnej\u0161i umetnik, delujo\u010d na Kranjskem v poznem 17. stoletju. \u010ceprav poznamo le malo zanesljivo Almanachovih del, pa tudi zgodovinskih notic o njem ni veliko in \u0161e te so skromne, je Zeriju uspelo rekonstruirati njegovo likovno kulturo in s tem pripraviti temelje za nadaljnje \u0161tudije. Poleg tega je prav zasluga rimskega raziskovalca, da je danes Almanachovo ime znano tudi v Italiji.     Federico Zeri and Almanach's fortuna critica     The paper presents Slovene studies of the great Italian connoisseur Federico Zeri, from the 1970s to the end of the 1990s. Particular emphasis is placed on their significance with regard to the understanding of the painter Almanach, who was probably the most important, but also the most mysterious of the artists who were active in Carniola in the late 17th century. Although only a few works are known that can reliably be attributed to Almanach and also historical notes about him are rare and meagre, Zeri managed to reconstruct the painter's visual culture and thus to lay foundations for further research. Besides, the credit goes exactly to the Roman researcher for introducing the name of Almanach into Italian scholarly circles.     Konserviranje in restavriranje slik Almanacha in njegovih sodobnikov     Narodna galerija v Ljubljani se v zadnjem desetletju ukvarja z raziskovanjem slikarstva 17. stoletja na Slovenskem. Pri projektu Almanach in slikarstvo druge polovice 17. stoletja na Kranjskem smo se sre\u010dali z opusom slik, ki je bil v precej dobrem stanju. Ve\u010dji posegi so bili potrebni le pri sedmih zelo po\u0161kodovanih slikah, ki pred tem niso bile vklju\u010dene v razstave in so se nahajale v prostorih z neustrezno klimo. Konserviranje in restavriranje je potekalo v Narodni galeriji v Ljubljani in v Restavratorskem centru Zavoda za varstvo kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine Slovenije med leti 2000 in 2005. Na\u010din konserviranja in restavriranja se je prilagajal vsaki umetnini posebej. V tej razpravi so uporabljeni postopki razvr\u0161\u010deni po najve\u010dkrat uporabljenem vrstnem redu: dokumentacija in diagnostika pred posegi, konserviranje in restavriranje ter dokumentacija in diagnostika med posegi. Rezultati preiskav so nas spodbudili k nadaljevanju dela.     The Conservation and Restoration of Paintings by Almanach and his Contemporaries     Over the last decade the National Gallery has been researching 17th century paintings in Slovene-speaking lands. In the project Almanach and the painting of the second half of the 17th century in Carniola we encountered an oeuvre in quite good condition. Major intervention was necessary only in the case of seven seriously damaged works which had not been exhibited and had been kept in storage under unsuitable climatic conditions. Conservation and restoration work was carried out at the Restoration Centre of the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage at the National Gallery in Ljubljana between 2000 and 2005. The methods used were adapted to each individual work. In this discussion, the procedures are arranged in terms of usual sequence of use: documentation and diagnostics prior to intervention, conservation and restoration, documentation and diagnostics during intervention. The results of our research encourage us to continue with our work. "

Moreover, the CDP analysis identifies the need to deploy unmanned systems to reduce the danger to human personnel and manned platforms, as well as to increase robustness, sustainability and resilience of ground systems. A comprehensive set of unmanned systems should contribute to the capability of land manoeuvre in the joint operational environment to gain positional advantage in respect to the adversary. Purely unmanned tracked vehicles as funded under EDIDP will be not considered under this topic.     Specific challenge     Most military experts and strategists agree that the ability to conduct swarm operations is probably the best response to future threats whether symmetrical or asymmetrical. In this context, it is therefore vital to have the ability to design and conduct long-distance operations against a highly mobile and unpredictable enemy through the flexible use of a significant number of unmanned and coordinated ground and air systems.     Indeed, intelligent and effective cooperation between unmanned ground systems (UGS), manned military vehicles, operators and air systems is needed to increase the robustness, sustainability and resilience of these terrestrial systems while reducing loss of life, the risk of collateral damage and lowering the cognitive burden placed upon operators.     Deploying a swarm-based manoeuvring capability in a framework of cooperation between manned and unmanned systems (manned-unmanned teaming) but also inside the swarm of unmanned systems is undoubtedly the strongest requirement in system design in the field of safety research.     Therefore, rapidly developing a capacity implies an incremental approach capable of proposing capability milestones in line with the development milestones of current and future land systems and allowing upgrades of legacy systems.     Scope: Proposals should address the development of hardware or software modules designed to enable manned-unmanned operation modes and taking into account teaming and swarming, and to be integrated or embedded into a set of digitalised ground Armoured Vehicles     POGOJI SODELOVANJA     Admissibility conditions: described in section 3 of the call document     UPRAVI\u010cENCI     Eligible countries: described in section 3 of the call document     Other eligibility conditions: described in section 3 of the call document     Financial and operational capacity and exclusion: described in section 3 of the call document "

Brda\u2026     \u2026 the playful, hilly land, where you will be mesmerised by the colourful palette of colours, smells and tastes.     Millions of years ago the area of Brda was covered by the sea. It was the time when the fertile soil was created that one day will give tons of juicy fruit and wines of exceptional quality.     Gradually, the sea withdrew and mother earth, through the centuries, created an idyllic landscape strewn with hills, intertwined with brooks and streams, covered with lush greenery. Landscape, which gradually descends to the vast plains of Friuli and the horizon disappears into the depths of the Adriatic Sea.

Behind the majestic walls in the middle of the colourful, hilly landscape you will find the medieval village of \u0160martno, one of the best preserved villages in Brda and at the same time one of the finest cultural and historical monuments of Slovenia. Once a fortified Roman outpost from which the Roman soldiers defended their empire from barbarians from the north. It was a strategic military fortress in the time of war between the Republic of Venice and Austria and a shelter against Turks and predators.Traces of a tumultuous past are visible on almost every step through the village, as you are never far from the preserved city walls and towers. After centuries of wars, looting and border tensions, the village's original military character gradually transformed until nowadays, where the village is more a romantic place, and it appears that time has stopped long ago. Due to many attractions, \u0160martno is the most visited tourist point in Brda. In addition to the magnificent baroque church of Saint Martin (with an even older bell tower and in-built Roman plate), Brda House (ethnological museum) and The House of Culture with an art gallery are also worth visiting.

      "text":" Background: The popularity of integrating quantitative and qualitative methodologies in the same research has grown incredibly in recent years. There is a lack of evidence about the efficiency of mixed methods use in health sciences research practice. The purpose of this study was to analyse the areas, main research themes, mixed methods research design typologies and efficiency of implementation and further open questions regarding mixed methods in health sciences. Methods: A systematic review was made on a sample of 25 scientific articles of health sciences that stated mixed methods use in research. Inclusion criteria: original scientific article with applying and evaluating of mixed methods, published during the period July 2006 - July 2011 in a peer reviewed journal, included in international databases: WebSurveyMethodology, CINAHL, MEDLINE and PubMed. Results: All 25 studies provided effectiveness of mixed methods use in health science research practice. Mixed methods are the most popular in nursing (32%) and health promotion (28%). Sequential mixed methods research design is prevalent (64.3%), with the first research phase in priority (71.4%). The relation between quantitative (57.2%) and qualitative (42.8%) priority approach is balanced. Complementarity (57.1%), triangulation (28.6%) and expansion (14.3%) are the most common research purposes for using mixed methods in health sciences. Conclusions: The presented findings confirmed mixed methods applicability for the complex and less studied research problems in health sciences. Conceptualisation of mixed methods in different disciplines of health sciences, development of quality criteria and standards for mixed methods research assessment and expansion of mixed methods in clinical practice as support in evidence based practice development appeared as the most important research questions of mixed methods in health sciences that should be addressed in the future studies.

June 2021     The film is an Italian-Slovenian-French co-production, with Mitja Li\u010den as the Slovenian director of photography.     Yesterday, Cannes unveiled the Critics\u2019 Week programme, which includes the Slovenian minority co-production Small Body, the debut feature of the Italian director Laura Samani that has qualified for the competition programme of seven selected films. On this occasion, the director stated the following: \u201cIf things do not have a name, they do not exist. Agata defies the established order of her time. She is a heroine who challenges the laws of society in the name of an unwritten law that is far more mysterious and unfathomable: absolute love. Her immense desire is to give her daughter a name so that she can let go of her once they become two separate beings. Agata\u2019s journey to the shrine is a gradual descent into the underworld, a path that leads her to the surprising discovery that there is a thin, unfathomable line between life and death, between reality and magic.\u201d     The film that is about to have its world premiere is an Italian-Slovenian-French co-production, with Mitja Li\u010den as the Slovenian director of photography. Mitja Li\u010den has received several awards for his previous work, including three Vesna Awards: for his features History of Love (2018) and The Tree (2014), directed by Sonja Prosenc, and the short film Paradise (2019), which he also co-directed with Sonja Prosenc.     The film was created with the participation of a number of Slovenian filmmakers, including a Slovenian technical team consisting of fourteen members. Furthermore, during the development stage of the project, the technical post-production of the photography, pre-production, and sound post-production were partly carried out in Slovenia. The Slovenian co-producer of the film is Danijel Ho\u010devar from the Vertigo production house, with Zala Opara as his assistant, while Matija Kozamernik is the production manager.     Italy, 1900. The young Agata gives birth to a stillborn child, who is therefore condemned to spend eternity in Limbo. Agata hears of a place in the mountains where infants can be brought back to life for just one breath and baptised so that their souls can be saved. She heads out on a journey with her daughter\u2019s tiny corpse hidden in a box and meets Lynx (Lince), a solitary boy who offers to help her. Together, they embark on an adventure that will bring them both closer to a miracle that seems entirely impossible.     Apart from the director, the screenplay was co-written by Marco Borromei and Elisa Dondi. Starring Celeste Cescutti as Agata and Ondina Quadri as Lince \/ Lynx. Also featuring Marco Geromin, Giacomina Dereani, Anna Pia Bernardis, Angelo Mattiussi, Luca Sera, Teresa Cappellari, Marzia Corinna Mainardis, Marisa Rupil, and the Slovenian actor Ivo Ban. Music by Fredrika Stahl, editing by Chiara Dainese, and sound by Luca Bertolin, Riccardo Spagnol, and Nathalie Vidal. Set design by Rachele Meliad\u00f2, costume design by Loredana Buscemi, and makeup design by Arianna Ferrazin.     The leading producer of the film is the Italian Nefertiti Film; the producers are Nadia Trevisan and Alberto Fasulo; while the French co-producer Thomas Lambert comes from the Tomsa-Films production company. The film was made with the financial support of the Slovenian Film Centre, the Friuli Venezia Giulia Audiovisual Fund, MIBACT, the international funds Eurimages and Creative Europe \u2013 MEDIA sub-programme, as well as Rai Cinema, CNC, ARTE\/Cofinova, Torino Film Lab Production Award, the Re-Act and When East Meets West development funds, and in collaboration with Viba Film Studio.     In 2018, at the development stage, the film received the prestigious Production Award at the Torino Film Lab and an award at the When East Meets West co-production meeting.     In the introduction, which presents the film selection, the following was written about the film Small Body: \u201cA breathtakingly beautiful film which proves that a great filmmaker was born.\u201d     The 60th-anniversary edition of the Critics\u2019 Week will take place from 7 to 15 July. The audience will have the opportunity to see thirteen features selected from among 1,000 films: seven in the competition programme and six at special screenings. Meanwhile, ten of the 1,620 short films that applied were chosen for the short film competition programme. Head here for more information on the entire Critics\u2019 Week programme.

P74 Center and Gallery The founding of the P74 Center and Gallery in Ljubljana fifteen years ago introduced a new model for art institutions and new methods for producing exhibitions; at the same time, it represented an important shift from the traditional \"objective\" exhibition model to more discursive ways of working. With its peripheral location \u2013 on the city margins, between the urban and the rural \u2013 P74 occupied a key strategic position.     Vesna Bukovec graduated and completed her MFA from the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana. She works independently and in the art group KOLEKTIVA (with Metka Zupani\u010d and Lada Cerar). Her artistic work finds its expression in a variety of media (video, photography, drawing, installation) and approaches (research, appropriation, participation, etc.).     Marija Mojca Punger\u010dar is working in the field of contemporary visual art (installation, video, performance), she is also involved with a theatrical costume design. Her work is characterized by socially content, the consummating criticism of society and emphasis locality and community. "

In zdaj ima spot za komad Judas Cradle, kar bend komentira takole:     \"'Judas Cradle' is our second single and shows more of the epic side of the album, It's a real journey into our musical trip. we really let loose on this one. Although on the surface the story is set in fantasy, lyrically it draws a strong parallel to the struggles of mankind living on this dying planet. It may appear very dark and depressing...but stick with it, there's light and hope for us all!\u201d     \"The video for 'Judas Cradle' is a tormented and twisted journey through the many levels of hell of a man trapped in his own mind. We had strong visions of the kind of feeling we wanted to convey and the type of mind-blowing visual extravaganza we felt such a song required. And filmmakers Khaled Lowe, Sam Edwards as well as Caleb Carney have done an incredible job of capturing our tortured imaginations.\"     Komad najdete na prvencu Celestial Mechanics, ki izide 12. aprila prek Century Media.     25. 3. 2019 Malorshiga ponujajo dve pesmi s svojega dema     Istrijanska black metal zasedba Malorshiga (foto: Jordan Rade\u0161i\u0107) ponuja dva komada s svojega dema, in sicer sta to Pergola ter Smrt na oljki. Komada sta na voljo tukaj.     PR-tekst pravi: \"Ob morju je veliko portalov, na katerih je Meduzina glava. Kot pravi zgodba, da sta se neko\u010d Pozejdon in Atena skregala, in ko sta se spopadla, je vrgla \u0161\u010dit v morje, ki je nato postal otok, Aegida, no, na svojem \u0161\u010ditu je imela Meduzino glavo. Danes ni \u010das, da bi povedali celo zgodbo, bomo pa nekaj rekli o nekem drugem portalu. \u010ce boste stopili skozi portal v doma\u010do istrsko muziko, portal Muzikobala, boste sli\u0161ali dva na\u0161a komada, ki smo ju posneli lani.

Tokrat pod imenom Nocturnus AD predstavlja album Paradox, katerega zgodba je nadaljevanje prvenca The Key.     Zasedba ponuja tudi prvi single s prihajajo\u010de plate, o komadu pa Browning: \"I think 'Paradox' is a great successor to 'The Key'. I didn't want to try and compete with what I did on that record or try and recreate it. I wanted to continue with the ideas and themes I never got to do back then. 'Precession Of The Equinoxes' is a brand new song that talks about the shifting of the magnetic poles of Earth. And, in fact, right now the magnetic poles are shifting faster than ever; it has been in the news just in the last couple of months. It happens in 26,000-year cycles, so we humans have never experienced a pole shift to where its effects were recorded. It could be a huge, disastrous occurrence when they shift completely.\"     Album izide 24. maja prek zalo\u017ebe Profound Lore.     Video of NOCTURNUS AD - Precession Of The Equinoxes (official audio)     25. 3. 2019 Machine Head z Burn My Eyes era reunionom     Ne glede na motiv, je super, da je Robb Flynn ponovno povabil k sodelovanju Logana Maderja in Chrisa Kontosa, ki sta seveda del kultnega prvenca Burn My Eyes, ki ga bodo oktobra igrali v celoti po Evropi. Ker pa gre za ''an evening with Machine Head'' tip ve\u010dera, bo triurni koncert seveda razdeljen na dva dela:     - klasike, a la Imperium, Halo itd. z novim kitaristom in bobnarjem, ki \u0161e nista predstavljena svetu     - Burn My Eyes v celoti, kjer se bosta Flynnu in MacEahernu pridru\u017eila \u0161e Kontos in Mader     Nam najbli\u017eje bomo tole videli v sredo, 16. oktobra, v Gasometru na Dunaju. Fuck yeah!     24. 3. 2019 Maja pa izide nova plata od Amon Amarth     Re\u010de se ji Berserker, iz\u0161la pa bo 3. maja prek zalo\u017ebe Metal Blade.     Krulja\u010d Johann Hegg pravi:     \"The previous album was a concept album, but we didn't want to get into a situation where every album has to be a concept record, so this is different,\" stated frontman Johan Hegg. \"We wanted to step away from that and look at being a little bit more diverse, with the lyrics and everything else. I got ideas from lots of different things, from history stuff and mythological sources. Sometimes you just get something in your head and there doesn't have to be a bigger meaning behind it \u2014 sometimes it's just a great metal lyric that fits with a great metal song. And these are fucking great metal songs.     \"For me, this is AMON AMARTH 2.0. I think what we've done here is give ourselves the space to explore other parts of our musicality and who we are as a band. If you're content with where you're at, what's the point of continuing? We always want to come up with new ideas and find new ways of doing things and to create bigger and better shows and really try to improve every aspect of what the band is. We want to try to keep growing and to do this for as long as we have the possibility to do so, because this is the best fucking job in the world.\"     24. 3. 2019 Junija izide tudi nova plata zasedbe Enthroned     Belgijski blekkerji Enthroned bodo 7. junija prek zalo\u017ebe Seasons Of Mist izdali album Cold Black Suns. Spodaj pa je tudi \u017ee novi single.     Bend pravi: \"We're proud to introduce our first single 'Silent Redemption' from the upcoming album 'Cold Black Suns'. This track unveils one of the many layers of the long awaited 11th opus. With 'Silent Redemption', we take you along to Aokigahara, the infamous Suicide Forest in Japan, to walk amongst the Y\u016brei. While keeping our band's trademark, this new album offers another pitch in the music, soaking the listener in bleak and fury.\"     Video of Enthroned - Silent Redemption (Official Track Premiere)     \u0160vedska post metal zasedba Cult Of Luna zdaj domuje pri zalo\u017ebi Metal Blade. Decembra pa se bo ob predstavitvi nove plate ustavila tudi v Ljubljani oziroma v Kinu \u0160i\u0161ka.     Nocturno Culto in Fenriz napovedujeta novo Darkthrone plo\u0161\u010do, Old Star. Album bo iz\u0161el maja letos prek Peaceville Records.     Fenriz pravi: \"'Old Star' \u2014 again we are here with the riffs! A while after our previous 'Arctic Thunder', album it became apparent that we would continue in that same style, black old heavy metal with slow thrash, classic doom and slow death metal.     As many have focused on the '70s sound over the last 20 years, the mix on our new album has ended up being more '80s than ever. The songs are more metal than ever! Ted's songs have alot of black metal in them, faster and slower but also doomier parts and reocurring parts. My songs are more linear written. It's an ancient '80s underground trick, with breaks, all slow heavy or slow thrash, classic doom or slow death.\"     All in all, it is our most '80s album so far and our most metal one to date with drum sound typical for the '80s USA\/German market and damned lyrics, which are all written by me. We feel that 'Old Star' is the big brother of 'Arctic Thunder'. More solid and with even better riffs.\"     \u0160vedski death metal band tvorijo Lars G\u00f6ran Petrov (vocals; ENTOMBED), Victor Brandt (guitar; ENTOMBED), Alex Friberg (bass; NECROPHOBIC), Fredrik Folkare (guitar; UNLEASHED, NECROPHOBIC) ter Matte Modin (drums; DARK FUNERAL, DEFLESHED), 7. junija letos pa bodo prek Century Media Records izdali album Abominate.     Basist Alex Friberg pravi: \"On this album, we pushed ourselves more then before outside our comfort zone. You will hear a lot more heavy metal influences on this album. We never aimed to be a death metal band in the ordinary death metal genre. We make exactly the kind of music that we like and that is more to the extreme side but we always try news things and think outside the box and that is what's so great with FIRESPAWN. Always refreshing great fucking metal! This album is no exception, quite the opposite. On 'Abominate', we explore new ground that not many death metal bands has before. Listen to it and you'll know what I'm talking about.\"     Naslovnico, ki jo je ustvaril Paolo Girardi, imate na levi.     Godthrymm je projekt, ki ga sestavljajo trije mo\u017eakarji - sedanji oziroma biv\u0161i \u010dlani zasedbe My Dying Bride. Trenutno so v fazi ustvarjanja prve plate, a ker se ho\u010dejo zares predstaviti svetu, ponujajo spot za komad We Are The Dead.     Kitarist\/vokalist Hamish Glencross pravi: \"We are incredibly proud to share this video with you to serve as an introduction to the band whilst we are in the process of securing a deal for our debut album.     \"Since forming only over a year ago, we have forged our strength as a tight, powerful live act following a couple of great festival appearances, some wonderful shows supporting such great bands as PARADISE LOST, MEMORIAM, VODUN, WITCHSORROW and PALLBEARER, as well as our own headline shows up and down the U.K. So we wanted to capture the power and energy of our live performance in a way to introduce ourselves to those unfamiliar with us (basically everybody!) So, we spent half a day in a studio in Sheffield with the very talented Nathan Bailey as producer, and we are very happy to share with you 'We Are the Dead'.\"     Video of Godthrymm \u201cWe Are The Dead\u201d live video session     V petdesetih letih prej\u0161njega stoletja so se v Sovjetski zvezi pojavili nenavadni razpe\u010devalci, ki so glasbo prepovedanih izvajalcev ponujali kar na rentgenskih slikah.     Album Dreaming Neon Black bi zaradi srhljivega ozadja najbr\u017e zlahka uvrstili med najbolj presunljive plate v metalu.     2020 bo o\u010ditno leto temnega vala. Ponovno obujanje \u017eanra darkwave je v polnem zagonu, zanimivo pa je to, da pri nas \u0161e zmeraj primanjkuje tovrstnih glasbenih zasedb.     18 let organiziranja koncertov raznih oblik ekstremne glasbe ni ma\u010dji ka\u0161elj, tako da lahko na tem mestu Dirty Skunksom samo \u010destitamo.     Noctiferia so nastopili suvereno in brez pretenzije, ki spremlja mnogo sodobnega black metala. Na ta na\u010din so se takoj pribli\u017eali ob\u010dinstvu in intimno vzdu\u0161je Ostrige izkoristili sebi v prid.     Da je ve\u010dina obiskovalcev tokrat pri\u0161la zaradi Voivod, je bilo ve\u010d kot jasno in logi\u010dno, vseeno pa se marsikdo zdaj lahko pohvali, da je enkrat v \u017eivljenju dejansko videl Gwar na koncertu.

      "text":" The smell of fresh mountain     And we said 9.9., at 9.09 am we will talk about ONTAP 9 on Kredarica. First there was laughter, then more serious faces, and later a relaxed \u201cwell, why actually not\u201d. Our team with the business partners of both sides of the chain \u2013 buyers and providers. All to make this chain even stronger than before. We won\u2019t tell this like a travelogue, about weather and the beautiful scenery you can\u2019t find words for anyway. Not even about the flora and fauna. I love to hear stores of individuals, who accompanied me on this journey. I begin to see that the participating members of the march up to Kredarica and all the way to Triglav are not coincidental; they are a part of their own life\u2019s story. I begin to see and admire values that I didn\u2019t seem to detect during our business meetings. And with each step my admiration grew. And when I reach the final chapter, I talk to the next person. A new person, a new life story to tell, the story which lead him\/her to this steep slope beneath the mountains. At steeper ends of the march, the words tend to get fewer and in my mind I then began to think about my own life story. Why am I here? Why I am in the midst of this team of hikers, which trusted and agreed to spend one day in their life with me? Do I really deserve this trust? Which person do I really have to thank for this? At this question, I start to think back about my pretty screensaver at home. About the first real telephone call, which invited me and allowed me to step into their embrace. Then \u2013 either you are, or you aren\u2019t. And I was. And happy and thankful too, for this life changing call I received. I think further ahead of this, through my friend circle I have, which helped me discover new paths in life, making jumps on other sides of the river and seeing and experiencing things I would have never imagined. Things, that later, turn out to be the best stories you can tell others at cozy campfires in the winter. Upon looking at our team\u2019s joy then they first saw the sunrise on the top of Triglav, a heavy weight was lifted off my shoulders. Not a heavy weight really, more like the weight of the whole world. With the effort and help of the whole team we made it. The trust I really did deserve, and I get a new chance. A chance to step into new chapters in our lives together. The end therefore turns into another chapter, a part filled with emotions, my personal favorite. Life runs by fast, so there is no reason for blank chapters in your life story. Onward we go, to write many more new stories.     Matej Mo\u0161kon     \u017divim pestro \u017eivljenje v ljubezenskemu \u010detverokotniku z dru\u017eino, firmo in gorami. Vrhunska oprema in napredna tehnologija me spremlja \u017ee desetletja. Odgovore na \u0161tevilna vpra\u0161anja, ki se mi porajajo, i\u0161\u010dem v naravi in tam najdem svoj notranji mir. Odgovornost do opravljenega dela mi vzbuja ob\u010dutke koristnosti. Radostno sprejemam vpra\u0161anja o nasvetih po konfiguracijah, izvedbi projektov, iskanju vzroka napak\u2026 Izku\u0161nje z veseljem delim z vsakim, ki mi je pripravljen prisluhniti. "

      "text":" Povzetek: An inventory of tree microhabitats was done in two unmanaged forests (Kobile and Ravna gora forest reserves) and one managed beech forest in SE Slovenia. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of forest management, natural disturbances, and tree characteristics on microhabitat patterns. Forest structure and microhabitats were recorded in systematically placed plots (500 m2 in size) across each area. In total, we inventoried 849 trees on 54 plots and 1833 tree microhabitats. The results showed that forest management had no significant influence on the abundance of microhabitats per tree, but there were differences regarding microhabitat type between managed and unmanaged sites. There were substantially more microhabitats related to standing dead and live habitat trees in unmanaged forest (e.g. woodpecker cavities, insect galleries and bore holes, branch holes, dead branches and fruiting bodies of fungi), whereas in managed forests there were more tree microhabitats related to management (e.g. exposed heartwood, coarse bark, and epiphytic plants). The results also indicate that disturbance, tree diameter, vitality, and species influence the density, diversity, and occurrence of tree microhabitats.

However, elevated temperatures may pose a risk of damaging surface coatings used on cultural and historical artefacts. Therefore, we monitored changes in patterns of the original paint taken from such objects along with newly prepared coatings. We evaluated visual, mechanical, and chemical modifications of coatings when exposed to microwaves (750W, 2.4GHz), at 60\u00b0C or 80\u00b0C for 10 min. Whether old or new, only water-based coatings have proven to be resistant to elevated temperatures and no damage was observed at 80\u00b0C. Blisters have formed on layers of new oil paints and natural resins due to insufficiently cured film. Temperatures above 80\u00b0C may cause melting of coniferous wood resin and thus transport of resin to the surface; on the other hand, temperatures up to 60\u00b0C are completely harmless. Mechanical and chemical changes of coatings exposed to microwaves were not observed, but the studies showed that colour and gloss exhibited minor changes.

The aim of the study was chemical and physical characterization of a wood surface concerning low and high temperature exposure. Additionally, the correlation between the chemical composition of a wood surface and its wetting capacity were investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements were conducted. Two wood species, yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and southern pine (Pinus taeda) were studied. The results showed that the percentage of carbon increased with drying temperature, and consequently, the percentage of oxygen decreased. The samples exposed to high drying temperatures indicated a higher content of extractives on the wood surface. These samples exhibited the highest contact angle and the lowest wettability Klju\u010dne besede: povr\u0161ina lesa, su\u0161enje, kontaktni kot, rentgenska fotoelektronska spektroskopija, omo\u010ditev, ekstraktivne snovi, wood surface, drying, contact angle, XPS, wettability, extractives DiRROS - Objavljeno: 12.07.2017; Ogledov: 1964; Prenosov: 569 Celotno besedilo (932,44 KB)     Povzetek: Pri poslovanju se, kakor tudi pri vseh ostalih odnosih, pojavljajo nasprotna mi\u0161ljenja in konflikti. Ravnanje s konflikti je ena pomembnej\u0161ih nalog managementa, ki mo\u010dno vpliva na u\u010dinkovitost in uspe\u0161nost podjetij. V raziskavi, ki je predmet tega \u010dlanka, smo preu\u010devali fenomen konfliktov v velikem lesnopredelovalnem podjetju na Hrva\u0161kem. Podatke smo pridobivali s strukturiranim anketnim vpra\u0161alnikom. Ugotavljali smo zna\u010dilnosti obstoje\u010dega modela ravnanja s konflikti v tem podjetju. Podrobneje smo preu\u010devali odnose med zaposlenimi, kako pogosto se pojavljajo konflikti in kako se vpleteni odzivajo nanje. \u010ceprav v preu\u010devanem podjetju formalno ne obstaja model ravnanja s konflikti, pa lahko na osnovi te raziskave ta model dovolj natan\u010dno identificiramo in doka\u017eemo njegove skupne zna\u010dilnosti. Rezultati so pokazali, da so odnosi med zaposlenimi v preu\u010devanem podjetju dobri ter, da je na\u010din odzivanja na konflikte pozitivno naravnan. Najpogostej\u0161i vzrok za konflikte je slab\u0161i pretok informacij med zaposlenimi, kar ka\u017ee na izrazito potrebo po izbolj\u0161anju komunikacijskega kanala, predvsem po razgovorih in razli\u010dnih drugih vrstah sestankov. Zato je to tudi eden izmed pomembnej\u0161ih elementov predloga modela za ravnanje s konflikti v preu\u010devanem podjetju.

In both countries, wood sector is a part of the national strategy plans and one of the industrial branches considered national economy boosters. But media coverage of wood industry and furniture manufacturing in Slovenia, as well as in Croatia, is far behind the promotion enjoyed by other industrial branches. This paper will give the current situation in promotional activities of wood sector in Slovenian and Croatian media and demonstrate the existing differences among given countries.

In July, three different phases of current annual xylem growth ring formation were found, as a result of various cambial tree productivity. In October, the cell divisions in the cambium were completed in all investigated trees, while the process of differentiation was not entirely completed in trees with a more productive cambium. The number of undifferentiated tracheids was higher in trees having a more productive cambium. In these trees, the cambial activity and the differentiation ended later. In declining trees, the number of cells produced by the cambium was lower and the duration of cambial activity was shorter.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

In order to do so it lays down certain concrete relationships between ideologies, terminologies and their effect; as in what exactly post colonial means, why it is important to understand the impact of colonisation on culture and thus on one of the most mass consumed medium in India; films. The thesis explores the depths and complexity of the relationship of these two and the other influences that sprout from it for example the intensity of colonisation as a cultural project and its influence on the social reality of the people, artists, thinkers (and in our case specifically filmmakers) , who in turn reflect on this culture through various mediums including films. The thesis examines the western plethora of film theory in order to accentuate the contrast between film and cinema in the west and east and thus the subsequent need to bring forth a new \u2018Eastern Film theory\u2019.

In terms of attitude and practice, and especially given the recent explosion of remote working, how can leaders maximise the chances of success? We talk with Arkadiusz Czopor, Managing Director, Asia South, T-Systems.     Three Takeaways:     1 \u2013 Remote Charisma     Executives who are good at transmitting their charisma in face-to-face interactions must be able to extend at least part of this charisma into remote interactions. Remote communication skills have become increasingly important during the Pandemic, and this importance will remain once the Pandemic has passed.     2 \u2013 A Win-Win Mentality     Asian business culture focusses less on competition and more on finding (and expressing) the win-win for all parties, including your own.     3 \u2013 The Power of Silence     Expect silence from Asian colleagues in your team meetings, at least in the short term. Be patient, build trust and respect, and give the opportunity to ask questions anonymously on paper ahead of the meeting. In meetings, learning to talk less and listen more brings greater business wisdom, and valuable insight into the Asian business mind.     Arkadiusz, what does the phrase \u2018Asian business culture\u2019 mean to you?     Here in Asia there are two dominant cultures, China and India. Two very large and strong cultures with thousands of years of heritage. Both are driven by a strong desire to grow and develop and create wealth, both individually and as a country. Not necessarily as we understand it, in an individualistic way, but having the prime objective of looking for a win-win situation for both parties involved in a deal.     Does that contrast sharply with Western business culture?     Western business culture is very much based on competition. We think about sport in terms of winning, and we don\u2019t necessarily look around at what else is happening. You could say that in the West an individual perspective is more endorsed, whereas in Asia there is more of a community perspective and always an eye for a symbiotic success.     What is the result of the two cultures coming together?     If you are Western in Asia, you need to adjust yourself because the cultures are so strong here. Even if you enjoy pushing competitively, here you need to look more holistically. Especially with regard to customers, you must understand the potential benefits for them, and explain how you as the provider will benefit, so that the benefits on both sides are clearly understood. This is an important foundation for trust.     Is it true to say that business culture, no matter where you are, becomes culture-neutral at higher levels?     I still believe there is a big gap between Asian and Western business cultures. Both sides are still learning how to deal with each other. But at the senior executive level there is such global experience and wide understanding of the many different cultural contexts in which to do business, that business between these people is quite smooth.     A Polish national, Arkadiusz has over 20 years\u2019 regional leadership experience in the Information and Communication Technology Industry. He has a proven track record of managing complex business portfolios, driving digitization and the transformation of multinational corporations, healthcare and public enterprises in cloud and digital computing. He is a Member of the Boards or Supervisory Boards in several T-Systems legal entities across the region. "

      "text":" Should You Upgrade to Windows 8? Questions to Consider     Should You Upgrade to Windows 8? Questions to Consider     Windows 8 has a brand-new look and feel, so make sure it is right for your organization.     By Ginny Mies     Windows 8 is unlike any operating system Microsoft has ever released \u2014 and that's a good thing. The bigger, bolder user interface is built for touchscreen tablets and PCs, as well as traditional desktop and laptop computers. The new Start screen resembles what you'd find on a smartphone or tablet with clean font, bright colors, and dynamic images. But Windows 8 also retains many of the features from Windows 7, so your staff should have no trouble getting used to the new interface. Looks aside, Windows 8 also offers some new features that may help your staff's productivity as well as the performance and longevity of your organization's computers.     To help you decide whether Windows 8 is a good fit for your organization, we\u2019ve come up with four questions for you to consider.     Will Your Organization Benefit from Windows 8\u2019s New Features?     The new Start screen replaces the Start menu found in the lower-left corner of previous versions of Windows. You can \"pin\" apps, contacts, and favorite websites to the Start screen to quickly access them. Microsoft will also have a variety of special Start screen apps (both free and paid) through the Windows Store, which you can get to by clicking its dedicated tile on the Start screen.     If you'd like the more traditional desktop view, you can click the \"Desktop\" tile. To switch back to the Start screen from the desktop, click in the lower left-hand corner where you'd expect to find the Start button in preceding versions of Windows. You can also toggle between the two views by pressing the Windows key, found on the lower left-hand side of your keyboard. It is easy to work strictly in the desktop if you can't get used to the new Start screen.     One of the big design changes in Windows 8 is the addition of \"charms\" in both the desktop and Start screen views. Hover your mouse to the right edge of your screen, and you\u2019ll see icons representing Search and Sharing functionality. Using the Search charm, you can easily search within a folder or application, or use it to prompt a Bing search in Internet Explorer.     Here are a few more advantages of Windows 8 to consider:     \u00b7 Better performance: Windows 8 uses less RAM and CPU resources than Windows 7 and therefore runs faster. For more on Windows 8's performance, see this benchmark comparison between Windows 7 and Windows 8 from PCWorld.     \u00b7 Works well on older machines: Windows 8 will not only work on your older IT equipment, but it runs faster than Windows 7.     \u00b7 Energy efficient: Windows 8 saves battery life by dropping to a low-power state when you're not doing anything power-intensive.     \u00b7 Security: Windows 8 comes with Windows Defender, which protects against malware and spyware. For more on Windows Defender and other security enhancements, read Windows 8 Security: What's New, What's Different.     \u00b7 Protection against hardware failure: Windows 8's Storage Spaces employs a software-based RAID system to protect data and ensure that it remains available in the event of a computer crash.     \u00b7 SkyDrive integration: Microsoft\u2019s cloud storage program is built into just about every application in Windows 8.     \u00b7 Multilingual: You can more easily switch between display languages, and additional display languages are available in Windows 8, which is of value to multilingual organizations.     Does Your Hardware Support Windows 8?     Next, you should confirm that your computers can support Windows 8. If your hardware supports Windows 7, you should have no issues upgrading to Windows 8. Though Windows 8 is also designed for touch-friendly devices, you can comfortably operate it with just a mouse and keyboard.     Windows 8 is available in a 32-bit and a 64-bit version. These versions have different requirements.     Microsoft DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver     Microsoft DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver     Will Your Programs Run on Windows 8?     Before upgrading, you should also determine whether your programs are compatible with Windows 8. If you\u2019re upgrading from Windows 7, you should be able to keep most of your existing software.     First, evaluate what software you have. If your organization\u2019s computers aren\u2019t standardized (in other words, if not every computer in your office runs the same programs), you may need to survey your users or use a free auditing program like Spiceworks IT Desktop to determine which programs are running on your computers.     Next, check if your software is compatible with Windows 8. You can run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant before you install the operating system. Alternately, you can also check Microsoft\u2019s Windows 8 Compatibility Center, which lists the compatibility status of Microsoft and third-party products and software. Don\u2019t see your software listed? You can also check your software vendors' websites to make sure your programs run on Windows 8.     If you have programs that run only on Windows XP, you won't be able to run them on Windows 8. Unlike Windows 7, Windows 8 doesn\u2019t have a special XP or Vista mode for running those programs. You also have the option to install Windows 8 on a virtual machine, like VirtualBox or the VMWare Player on an actual Windows XP machine. For more on virtualization, read TechSoup's Virtualization 101 article.     Client Hyper-V built-in virtualization (64-bit versions only)     x     x     x     For the full list of features for each version, visit Microsoft's Windows Blog on the editions. For more on Windows 8 Enterprise's features, see our Windows 8 Enterprise product page.     Conclusion     Windows 8's revamped look will likely require a learning curve for your organization's employees. A brown bag workshop on Windows 8's new features and functionality might be useful for your staff before upgrading.     Note: As of April 8, 2014, Microsoft will no longer support Windows XP, so if your organization's systems are still running Windows XP you should start planning an upgrade to either Windows 8 or Windows 7 as soon as possible. Windows 7 and Vista support will continue until 2017, if you decide that now is not the right time to upgrade. "

      "text":" About me     The beginnings of my familiarisation with glass are in 1999 when I had the first opportunity to observe the production of traditional stained glass. I remember being taken over by glass as a material and the medium to the extent I decided to embark on a quest to discover and explore its and my options.     The first years were marked by production of a variety of spatial forms and glazing in the Tiffany technique and classic stained glass. I have always been fascinated by tinted glass in appropriate spatial placement because of its speech at different times of the day, the play of light and shadow and colour shade overflow. Due to curiosity, enthusiasm and creative energy, I was soon oriented towards glass melting, which now remains my main interest.     Glass melting or fusion takes place in an oven at high temperatures, thus offering unlimited possibilities for experimenting with form and colour. Also other glass treatment techniques may be used, i.e. cold treatment, casting, pate de verre technique, elements of Murano glass.     In my view, glass resembles to a living organism and speaks in its own specific strange and challenging language and often conducts in a specific manner, which for me is a constant challenge.     Maja Zaplotnik     Critique     Design concept by Maja Zaplotnik is an original and sophisticated. Viewer is provided with dynamic visual experiences and content that is discreetly derivative and translated into a simple yet sophisticated and effective translucent whole. Artist\u2019s works provide to the Slovenian space new expressive dimensions and values that are in the context of contemporary glass design quite rare, namely spatial light entities, ideally connecting technical expertise with a rich creative imagination. The author successfully upgrades the basic functionality of objects with specific aesthetic elements and colour accents that semantically and formally change the basic character of glass surfaces and layers. Glassware of Maja Zaplotnik includes paintings, sculptures, reliefs and lighting fixtures, in short thoroughbred artistic organisms that do not impose strict boundaries between artistic media. Her sculptural-design space installation are spontaneous and dynamic, \"existent\" beyond the standard definition of style and genre, but this is far from meaning that her motif contexts are not implemented consistently in harmony with the primary idea. Artist's abstract vision through the prism of glass of objectivity is unusual both in terms of design as well as implementation aspects. So we are dealing with a well-researched visual language that preserves the playful narrative, aesthetic and fluid-structural poetics of light relations. The most common theme of this specific art nature is the nature with luxury of its forms; an important factor is also dreams as well as wide variety impressions. We are faced with the newly defined world, self-contained designed and completed with a rich symbolism. The artist is looking for new meanings, transcendence and integrity. Her fine art reveals multisignification, sometimes emotionally subtle, sometimes violent and surprising. She speaks to us in an exciting, stylish and very distinctive artistic approach that can be perceived one way or another, depending on our mood. "

      "text":" Milonga Carmencita 02 05 2015 - Naoko (JPN)     Milonga Carmencita 2. 5. 2015     Zadnja milonga je bila v soboto, 2. 5. 2015. Za izbor glasbe je skrbela resident musicalizador iz Villa Malcolm iz Buenos Airesa, Naoko.     Kot prvijo Italijani: La classe non \u00e8 acqua. Prevod bi bil lahko: 'vino ni voda'. V na\u0161em smislu bi pomenilo: da je Naoko redke in visoke kvalitete in je ni primerjati kar s komerkoli.     Vtisi:     Tokrat je kljub aprilskem (!) vremenu in prvomajskih praznikih pri\u0161lo lepo \u0161tevilo ljudi. Imeli smo se prav lepo. Naoko pa je tako dobro izbirala glasbo, da je \u010das minil, kot bi mignil.     Ja, fotografije so posente s telefonom... neko\u010d bo denar tudi za bolj\u0161o kamero...     V\u010dasih si mislim, kako fajn bi bilo, \u010de bi bil prostor \u0161e nekoliko ve\u010dji...     Ne vem, kako se izide, ampak tokrat je bilo mo\u0161kih celo nekaj ve\u010d, kot \u017eensk (sicer je po navadi kar v redu razmerje).     Naslednji posnetki so tokrat posve\u010deni objemom.     Zanimivo je, kako se objamemo (ne samo \u017eenske mo\u0161kega, tudi obratno - zelo!).     Nekateri objemi s \u0161e posebej prijetni.     Objem je, kot neke vrste 'akumulator', da la\u017eje pre\u017eivi\u0161 teden, ki sledi...     \u010ce je pa za me\u0161alno mizo tak kaliber, kot je Naoko, pa je objem \u0161e prijetnej\u0161i.     .. in jo je odpeljal na 'sprehod' po plesi\u0161\u010du. :)     Komaj \u010dakam naslednje milonge. In, da bom lahko ve\u010d plesal (organizacija in skrb a milongo vzame \u010das...).     Moja malenkost in moja 'desna roka'. Hvala ti, Tina!     Kraljica ve\u010dera: Naoko, zatopljena v svojo kreacijo...     \u0160e intervju z Naoko, kiga je opravila Tina Ferrari:     Tina: You were the resident musicalizador (every Friday) in Villa Malcolm, at the milonga TangoCool, Buenos Aires. Tell us about it. How did you get started there? Naoko: Sounds odd but I somehow became DJ naturally with lots of luck and support by adventurous friend. It all started with curiosity by asking questions to DJs for name of the song and Orchestra. Then it became request, suggestions to Gabriel Glagovsky, a good friend of mine who is DJ, maestro and also organizer of Milonga, Tangocool. Soon after I started to mock-up tanda(s) which include songs I like to dance to. Then soon, I started to build long playlist just for fun. One day, he needed four-hour-playlist so I volunteered to help him out. It was so much fun for me and I loved the process. He tested the list and got very good feedback. He started to give me a credit to people who commented for music. Tangocool always had been my favorite place to dance, so I only wanted \"it\" to have the best music possible. With his encouragement, I started be a 'back-stage DJ' playing music behind the scene weekly. With constant positive feedback, I went public as a Resident DJ of Tangocool 6 months later.     Tina: How has Buenos Aires changed you? Naoko: Forced me to find what makes me happy and what is important in my life and make decision accordingly. Also I learned to adjust rapid change and be spontaneous... Tina: You have lived in the USA as well. How would you compare living in Japan, USA, Argentina and Europe from the tango view point? Naoko: It's a long story\u2026.. it's difficult to generalize. For example Italy and Germany are so different but they are both in Europe. I would say each area, each country and each city has something unique. Tango reflects something cultural (warm, friendly, open, cozy, polite, intense, slow, traditional, fun, crazy, noisy, behavior of men and women) at least 50% of the place (continent, country, city) and the rest of 50% is depends on who is putting more effort in. (ex. Milonga organized by Argentineans are a lot more similar feel to one in Argentina even though it's in Europe. I love visiting new place to discover how people are.     Tina: Now you are living in Europe. How can you replace the difference? Naoko: Adapt and Adjust Take only positive side of difference as much as possible and enjoy.     Tina: Tango orchestra question: which is your favorite orchestra and why? Naoko: It changes and it differs for listening, dancing, DJing, getting inspired\u2026 But I like D'Arienzo, Troilo, Laurenz, Canaro, De Caro\u2026.. uy\u2026\u2026 I like all\u2026. There is no particular reason but because I've NEVER get tired of listening! Tina: Talk to us about Osvaldo Pugliese. Naoko: Something so deeply emotional. I almost don't want to talk about it --- I just want to feel. Tina: How do you mentally construct the milonga? Naoko: First breath and feel the air of the milonga (place, people\u2026.) then focus\u2026 Once it starts, I let it fly. Tina: Dream DJ gig? Naoko: When I can completely connected with dancers through music. Tina: Let's go back to Buenos Aires. Given your experience there, what is your message to the dancers here when you play, if any? Naoko: In generally, porte\u00f1os have much more knowledge and preference to the music, therefore they don't just dance any music with anyone, they listen first part of the tanda to decide with whom they want to dance with. I try to clearly state the mood each tanda so that dancers can learn differences and experience the depth. Tina: What is one detail of Buenos Aires milongas that you would bring to European milongas? Naoko: Authentic essence of Tango including codes (behavior in milonga, cabeseo, how to dance on the floor) Tina: What is one detail of European milongas that you would bring to Buenos Aires milongas? Naoko: High Quality items (place to dance, sound system, etc...) Tina: We talk a lot about Buenos Aires. What's so special about tango in Buenos Aires? Naoko: For tango dancers, Buenos Aires is Buenos Aires and it's one and only. Tina: Should everyone go to Buenos Aires? Naoko: Yes, (if one can manage). Dancing Tango in Buenos Aires is like Eating Sushi in Japan. You don't really know what it is until you experience the real one in the authentic location. Tina: Last question. Naoko, can you give us a little bit of Buenos Aires - a little bit TangoCool - on 2 May? Naoko: Yes!!! I'm so excited to be there!!!!     Thank you very much, Naoko.     Tudi sicer pa je Naoko zelo priteno bitje in \u010dast mi je bilo jo spoznati.     Saj pride\u0161, \u0161e, Naoko, kajne? Seveda! :)     Do naslednji\u010d, ko nas bo razvajal David Alvarez iz Francije (4.7.2015) pa se od milonge lepo poslavljamo. V juniju pa Milonge Carmecita ni (se re\u010de. da gresta El Cachafaz in Carmencita na dopust...).     Pride\u0161? Pridi!

Mark Porter, one of the most influential news and editorial designers in the world, does not define himself as such anymore. After working in the industry for more than three decades, he increasingly sees himself as a media designer and storyteller rather than a news designer. His projects are about creating and developing visual identities that can transcend individual products and adapt to a variety of platforms. Always systematic, precise and obsessed with alignments and distances, his projects are a solid tool kit for editorial use. The greatest challenges of journalism nowadays range from financial limitations, to competition for one's attention by multi-platforms and various channels in print or digital, to the most important of all: credibility. To counteract the loss of confidence in news journalism, argues Mark Porter, design is a great ally to editorial content in order to maintain quality standards and win back the trust of the audience. Case studies exhibited outline strategies for three different publications: the independent UK newspaper The Guardian; the iconic architecture and design magazine Domus; and the most important science magazine in the world, Nature.

      "text":" Sinopsis     Moderna galerija has a long-term relationship with the Livada elementary school, the school with the highest percent of non-Slovene pupils in the country. The third workshop was focused on creating a stop-motion animated film with mastering the entire process from making movable paper puppets to photographing and rendering images in an open-source computer program. The participants made a world map and all the animals that migrate shorter or longer distances. The materials they used were crayons and paper.     Since there is such an ethnically diverse group of pupils, we will organise activities that can complement their regular school lessons. In the school as well as in our museum we will organise four workshops to create social games from all parts of the world, especially from the countries the pupils come from. Participating pupils will choose and create the games themselves, with the assistance of their teacher from the Livada elementary school Natalija Veseli\u010d Martinjak and the museum educators, Dana Terzi\u0107, Maru\u0161a Megli\u010d, Anja Radovi\u010d, together with the architect and activist Tanja Zavr\u0161ki. The working methodology stimulates co-learning instead of competition, creativity, spontaneity, self-confidence, a positive self-image, and persistence.

You can choose from a variety of screen colours and designs to best match your taste and vehicle.     7-inch Screen with 1 DIN chassis     More and more vehicles feature a dashboard space for a 7-inch or 8-inch screen, however behind the screen there is no space to fit a full 2DIN product. The new SMART is for example one of the the vehicles with such dashboard design. Alpine designed the INE-W720DC to overcome this problem by putting a 1DIN chassis in the back of a 7-inch screen.

Note: X901 and X902 series systems are not compatible with park4night.     Set your vehicle\u2019s measurements     The big advantage of this navigation product is that you can input your vehicle\u2019s height, length, width, weight, and if you tow a trailer or not. These parameters are then considered when a route is calculated, to avoid results that are inappropriate for your specific vehicle.     Set your cargo parameters     The type of cargo you transport is equally important then a truck\u2019s measurements and weight: many areas have strict regulations when it comes to dangerous goods and can not be entered if a specific cargo type is loaded. This navigation unit allows you to input the type of cargo (such as explosives, flammable or non-flammable gas, poisonous substances, etc) to avoid that any route calculation includes restricted areas.     Online Navigation with Apple CarPlay     When you\u2019re driving, Maps helps you find the way to your destination with turn-by-turn spoken directions and new, easier-to-read visuals. When a turn is coming up, the view zooms in to show you exactly where to go. Along the way, large signs and arrows guide you in the right direction and let you know how long it\u2019s going to take to get there. Looking for a gas station, restaurant, or coffee shop along your route? New buttons on the navigation screen help you quickly find the closest places and estimate how much time the detour will add to your trip.

Online Navigation with Android Auto     Let Google Maps lead the way. It\u2019s easy to get where you\u2019re going with free voice-guided navigation, live traffic information, lane guidance, and more.

The INE-W720DC works seamlessly with Android Auto and Google maps. Android Auto can even access the Alpine navigation antenna for highest positioning accuracy.     GPS and Glonass Compatible     More satellites equal higher navigation accuracy and a faster positioning fix. This Alpine product is compatible with GPS satellite signals and can also receive positioning data from Glonass satellites. This brings big advantages especially in an urban environment with many tall buildings and when driving next to high mountains. When using navigation with Apple CarPlay and Glonass you can also benefit from this new improved compatibility.     Built-in Bluetooth\u00ae Technology     The built-in Bluetooth\u00ae module allows wireless connection of a mobile phone for hands-free communication. A very intuitive user interface makes it very easy to set microphone and speaker volume. It also includes a speed dial function for the most frequently called numbers. Bluetooth\u00ae also enables audio streaming from the phone: audio content or even internet radio can be wirelessly transferred to your Alpine unit.     Vehicle Data-Bus Connectivity     If your car is equipped with parking sensors, you can continue to use this convenient function with your INE-W720DC.

This enables compatibility with your vehicle\u2019s steering wheel control buttons, display of air conditioning settings as well parking sensor display. You can even see navigation turn-by-turn arrows in your multi-function display in the instrument cluster (if the vehicle supports it).

Alpine offers a wide variety of front and rear facing cameras, including multi-view cameras with selectable viewing angles and touch-control from your screen. You can even view the camera screen and parking sensor screen simultaneously.

Favourites is just that. Simply hold the audio button for one second to activate the Favourites view and you are ready to go.     Voice Control     Push the VOICE button on your Alpine unit or your steering wheel buttons (if supported) to activate SIRI or OK Google. You can simply call people, enter navigation destinations, write and send messages or simply say the song or playlist you like to listen to \u2013 just to name a few examples. This is a very convenient way to control your Alpine system while keeping your eyes on the road.

      "text":" Opis: People have travelled and migrated since the early periods of history and the phenomenon of migration, defined as \u201cthe movement of large numbers of people, birds or animals from one place to another\u201d (Oxford Advanced Dictionary, 7th ed.) has a history of hundreds of years (Pourjafari, Vahidpour, 2014) and is by no means new. But the way of travelling, migrating and mobility in contemporary reality does have many specific aspects and recently it has been studied in new ways, with new concerns. The experience of migration in the contemporary world is a fundamental characteristic of human societies. \u201cIt is a system in which the circulation of people, sources and information follows multiple paths. The energy and barriers that alter the course or deflect the contemporary patterns of movement have both obvious and hidden features. While nothing is utterly random, the consequences of change are often far from predictable\u201d (Papastergiadis, 2000: 1). This unpredictability and multidirectionality has led to changes in approaches to the study of migration in recent decades. In the last few decades the study of migration has increasingly been accompanied by a tendency to study it on the individual level \u2212 at the level of personal life stories (Milhar\u010di\u010d Hladnik, 2007). These are also markedly expressed in the medium of literature. The present dissertation presents literary oeuvres of seven women writers, who thematise the autobiographical experience of migration, it offers an individually, woman-centred experience and view of migration. In selected oeuvres personal views are expressed on that experience, different strategies of coping with life in new realities and regarding relationships in these environments. The thematisation of the experience of migration in selected oeuvres is also connected with a problematisation of other concepts: the concepts of belonging, borders, nation-state, culture and language. It is also vitally connected with the personal identity construction of the lyrical subjects and literary characters and also because of the autobiographical character of selected literary works of the literary artists themselves. The experience of migration in selected literary works leads to unique identity formations, which in themselves combine elements of different cultural backgrounds and traditions. In their literary works these selected women writers also shape their relationship toward time and space dimensions, tradition and interpersonal relationships through the experience of migration. The experience of migration, the relocation of the subject and a change of the geographical area in selected oeuvres, does not only represent a change of the geographical position: it also allows a deviation from other rigid and seemingly fixed and unvarying patterns and virtual realities that accompany human life. Migration can also present an alienation effect from traditionalisms and determinants that define human lives. In the literary oeuvres of these selected women writers, migration is only in part tied to the traditional concepts related to migrants, with the loss of roots and rupture with the place of origin. In the selected literary oeuvres, migrants are rarely considered to be uprooted and unable to find their anchor or confidently start a new chapter in their lives in a new environment. Migration is mostly connected with the possibility of expanding the horizon of insights and perspectives of looking at life, with the acceptance of its complexities, ambiguities and incompleteness. Mostly, the experience of migration is seen as a new, creative option, which opens and examines the wide range of other issues and dilemmas. The condition of uprooted loss has traditionally negative connotations, but in the selected oeuvres vagueness and fluidity allow a real insight into the real, complex nature of life and human existence.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

If you want us to take care of your food, we will prepare typical Koro\u0161ka dishes, such as \u201cklo\u010davi nudli\u201d (dried pear noodles), \u201c\u017eganci\u201d (a dish similar to polenta, but prepared with finer grains) larded with cracknels, fermented milk and buckwheat \u201c\u0161truklji\u201d (rolled dumplings). Our rye bread or, as it is called here, black bread, is yet another specialty, baked in a wood-fired oven to an old family recipe. It goes perfectly with home-made dried meats and a glass of home-made apple cider.     Another specialty in our cuisine are various delicacies made of spelt - side dishes, salads, bread, pastries and home-made spelt pasta.     Cuisine     Cuisine is important on our farm because we want you to really experience our way of life. Our ORGANIC food is home-grown. We produce several sorts of cereals (rye, spelt, oats\u2026), vegetables, herbs, currants, raspberries, old apple varieties, pears and cherries. We pick blueberries and cranberries in nearby forests. We put all these on the table either freshly-picked or dried, in juices and jams, or in various dishes.     Our cattle spends most of the year in pastures and we built a special place for our pigs so they can walk freely around the farm. All animals are fed with home-made fodder and we take special care to breed satisfied animals in the best possible conditions.

Activities     The only thing limiting you around our farm is your imagination. Our family makes a special effort with the youngest visitors and because there is always work to be done on the farm, we are really happy to have an extra pair of small hands around. You can help us feed the pigs after breakfast, let cows out to pastures, collect eggs, and there is plenty of other chores. There are plenty of seasonal chores, such as harvesting hay, apple picking and other harvest chores. You will find out how interesting and exciting these tasks can be. If you are interested in the making of home-made rye bread, the lady of the house, who is also the main cook, will show you around. Of course, after the bread is baked a tasting is necessary. It is best done with our honey.     Zala will be happy to take you to her horse, which you can look after, prepare for riding and take out for a ride.     In the hot summer days you can take an hour\u2019s drive to cool in splendid Austrian lakes, which are ideal for leisure and children\u2019s play. In the valley you can visit a summer pool with slides and the Radlje Water Park, which boasts a natural pool.     Not to be forgotten, there is a playground right next to our house where you can play football, volleyball or table tennis. It also has a slide, swings and a sandbox. And the nearby pond is the perfect spot to test your fishing skills.     Numerous activities are also available in the winter, including snowball fights and sledding for kids, and skiing at the nearby Petzen and Kope resorts.     Mountain Biking     Our farm is situated in the centre of the Jamnica Single Trail Park, which makes mountain biking one of our primary activities. You can choose to take bikes and criss-cross through Koro\u0161ka to get to know its beauties, or, if you are feeling a bit more adventurous, you can get lost for hours in the myriad of marked single trails in the park we built with other tourism farms in the area. With our neighbours, the Bike Nomad agency, we provide guided tours around the local mountains. We can also organise tours around Slovenia for those who want more. The younger son, Matev\u017e, is a mountain biking guide and can help you with either mending your bike or organising and advising you on your tours.     A nearby bike park in Austria, boasting the longest flow trail in Europe (11km) is a 40-minute drive away. It will be of special interest to mountainbikers.     For those yearning for something really special, we can organise a guided bike tour through the Me\u017eica lead and zinc mine, which is also suitable for children. During the tour, you will get to know a lot of interesting details about the history of mining and the lives of miners or knapi as we call them. You can also embark on a kayaking adventure through the flooded tunnels of the mine or decide on a classical tour of the mine by foot. Tours in the mine are available year-round.

New website: http:\/\/au.ung.si\/en     School     The University of Nova Gorica School of Arts has been awarded accreditation as an Academy by the Slovenian Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. In English it retains the naming as the School of Arts.     The School of Arts of the University of Nova Gorica is a dynamic school offering up-to-date studies with regard to teaching methods as well as teaching staff. In fostering our students' development, we pursue a personal approach, support e-learning, are intermedia friendly, and practice interdisciplinary cooperation.     University of Nova Gorica School of Arts Brochure as e-book or pdf     We value each student as an independent and creative personality developing in the group and community. With innovative approaches to teaching, research, and production processes, we encourage independent creative and academic student work, led by a group of expert mentors. Mentors and guest lecturers are carefully selected, the decisive factor being their excellence in contemporary practice as well as academic reputation. This ensures that high quality and up-to-date knowledge and skills are provided to students. Project work in extracurricular environments during the period of study provide students with valuable experience working on real and complex projects. Thus, students acquire work experience and references in their selected field already during their studies. After graduation all of this enables a smooth and quick transition to professional production environments or further studies.     Did you know? Studying in Slovenia as a foreign student is cheapest, \"most affordable in all Europe.\" (The Independent, 2015)     The School of Arts was founded in 2008, upon the fifteen years of experience of the Famul Stuart School of Applied Arts. The new school continues to evolve and develop innovative ways to provide knowledge and skills through practical examples and contextual projects. Basic school activities are centred on the notion of art and broadening the application of art, from creative industries to specific interactions with science and technologies, as well as interdisciplinary media production contexts.     Location     Situated right on the boarder between Italy and Slovenia, the twin towns of Nova Gorica and Gorica are situated at the mouth of the stunning So\u010da Valley and well connected both regionally (Vipava valley, Gori\u0161ka Brda, Ljubljana, Trieste, Venice), and internationally (Milan, Vienna, Zagreb, Rijeka). The close connection of the Slovenian Nova Gorica with the Italian neighbor (twin-) town Gorizia enables students diverse forms of activities and cooperation both within and outside of the academic environment.     After collaborating at reviving the historical Fu\u017eine castle (1994 - 2004, as Famul Stuart) and facing the modern numb passage of Be\u017eigrajski dvor (2004 - 2012), both in Ljubljana, the School of Arts continues to interact with neighbouring and more distant surroundings in the Gorica region, first in the historical Gorica (2012 - 2019) and since December 2019 in Ro\u017ena Dolina, Nova Gorica. >> More about the school spaces and Yearly Show Photo Galleries     University of Nova Gorica School of Arts Brochure as e-book or pdf     Information for international students at the University of Nova Gorica (accomodation, visas, working permits, etc.) \u2013 brochure (PDF) "

      "text":" Nahajate se tukaj     \u0160OU threatens to suspend R\u0160 funding     On its evening meeting on December 30th, 2020 the newly elected Student Assembly of the Student organisation of the University of Ljubljana (\u0160OU) discussed the 2021 draft budget which no longer includes co-financing of Radio Student (R\u0160). The Assembly had recently changed the rules relating to \u0160OU\u2019s financing which in their new version do not even provide for the minimum percentage as regards the concession fees-based financing of the activities of the institutes of the Student organisation family.     It is worth noting that during the epidemic Radio \u0160tudent took great efforts in adapting to new circumstances and managed to successfully complete all ongoing projects and even enhance the programme, including special media coverage of the covid-19 pandemic. Even so Radio \u0160tudent was put in a disadvantaged position and pulled the shortest straw in 2020 compared with the other members of the Student organisation family. The financial support has been diminishing for almost a decade; the amount of 230 000 EUR earmarked for the Radio in 2012 grew gradually smaller with the result that last year R\u0160 received only 120 000 EUR of financial support for its regular activities. We can assume that with the draft budget proposed by \u0160OU at the very end of 2020 the future prospects for Radio \u0160tudent will be very grim, much grimmer than those of all the other members of the \u0160OU family, although R\u0160 was not the only one that suffered disproportionately.     \u0160OU\u2019s draft budget for 2021 which went through first reading in the Student Assembly is almost 3 000 000 EUR. The most striking disproportion concerns the Student campus, which according to this proposal will be allocated 325 000 EUR from the concession fees in 2021. It is our conviction that we are not the only ones interested in knowing what activities are planned in the Student campus this year and what they have been doing since the start of the epidemic considering that they radically reduced their activities, which Radio \u0160tudent did not.     We are also convinced that the disproportionally low funding that R\u0160 received from \u0160OU last year has been put to better use than the millions spent for salaries, meeting fees and closed \u0160OU institutes. We therefore demand that our radio station is allocated at least 120 000 EUR in 2021 which would be proportionate with the budget that has been understandably reduced due to the pandemic. We are also in favour of maintaining the minimum rates of funding for the institutes of the \u0160OU family. Furthermore we demand that Radio \u0160tudent is included in all the discussions regarding its uncertain future.     Radio \u0160tudent is faced with a survival challenge which is unprecedented in the 50-year history of this institute that has been playing an important and unique media, educational and cultural role, also at the European level, and which at the moment employs more than 200 young part time co-workers, who create 17 hours of live programme daily. Radio \u0160tudent\u2019s resiliency in carrying out its educational mission is proved by 50 new colleagues that join us every year. The actuality of this activism is corroborated by the record number of young people enrolled in R\u0160 auditions at the end of last year (about 200 students enrolled in training in editorial departments and editorial services at R\u0160). An above average number of currently renowned academics, scientists, businessmen, politicians gained their experience at R\u0160; today active successful presenters, radio and TV anchors, cultural producers and managers made their bones at R\u0160. Last but not least our editor Zarja Mur\u0161i\u010d received an award by the Slovenia Journalist Association for outstanding journalistic achievements in her covering of the covid-19 epidemic. Or, if we borrow the words of the renowned Slovenian radio presenter Jure Longyka from last autumn: \u201cRadio \u0160tudent is an achievement of civilization. To lose it would be a defeat of civilization.\u201d     Duhovito, ampak \u0161e zmerja zgolj spust po istem toboganu nekoga, ki zna napleteni\u010diti nekaj \u0161e kar duhovitih stavkov, ki pa samo dokazujejo, da je s     Zanima me naslov komada. Bil je med 11. in 13. uro. Del liriksa pa \"ko te ni, imam abstine\u010dno krizo\" pa nekaj o koki idk. "

      "text":" ABOUT US     Reclaim the Power Association is a non-governmental, non-profit and humanitarian organization. Our primary mission is to provide comprehensive psychosocial assistance and support to the victims of sexual violence and to stand by their side in the path of recovery. The association was founded in 1994 under the name Association Against Sexual Abuse. After 25 years of existence we adopted the name Reclaim the Power Association to fully express our commitment to the contemporary social work theory and practice.     Our work is based on the recognition of the dynamics of sexual violence and thus appropriate professional action:     Sexual violence is a form of violence, namely abuse of power, position, influence and knowledge over another person.     The perpetrator holds full responsibility for sexual violence!     Sexual violence is one of the worst possible crimes committed against another human being, as it affects the intimacy of a person and can lead to sexual traumatization, thus significantly affecting the quality of life of the victim.     Each victim responds differently to sexual violence and carries different psychological, social and biological consequences.     Victims of sexual violence need a supportive environment, one that accepts their expressions, provides support and a sense of security, as well as gives assistance in accordance with expressed needs.     We provide help and support for minors and adults who:     have experienced sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence,     have experienced sexual violence by a partner, relative, acquaintance, associate or other person,     want to protect a child, adolescent or adult person from sexual abuse,     counselling work with adolescents,     In addition to individual and group forms of assistance and support, our work is also focused on counselling and support for professionals and institutions who may face cases of sexual violence and abuse in their working environment. We also provide training on sexual abuse for all professional profiles.     CONTACT     You are politely invited to make any inquiry about our organization and work. We are available every weekday between 8 am and 4 pm or write us a message and we will respond to you as soon as possible. "

      "text":" LEVEL-UP - Protocols and Strategies for extending the useful Life of major capital investments and Large Industrial Equipment     The main purpose of the H2020 LEVEL-UP project is to offer a scalable platform covering the overall lifecycle, ranging from the digital twins setup, modernisation actions to diagnose and predict the operation of physical assets, to the refurbishment and remanufacturing activities towards end of life according to I4.0.     Project description:     H2020 project LEVEL-UP aims to offer a scalable platform covering the overall lifecycle, ranging from the digital twins setup, modernisation actions to diagnose and predict the operation of physical assets, to the refurbishment and remanufacturing activities towards end of life. In-situ repair technologies and the redesign for new upgraded components will be facilitated through virtual simulations for increased performance and lifetime.     LEVEL-UP will therefore comprise new hardware and software components interfaced with the current facilities through IoT and data-management platforms, while being orchestrated through eight (8) scalable strategies at component, work-station and shopfloor level.     The actions for modernising, diagnosing, inspecting, repairing, disassembling , upgrading, refurbishing, remanufacturing, recycling and reassembly & testing will be structured and formalised into ten (10) special Protocols, linked with an Industrial Digital Thread weaving a seamless digital integration with all actors in the value chain for improved future iterations.     LEVEL-UP will be demonstrated in 7 demo sites from different sectors in the operational environment of Vertical Lathes, Milling machines, Presses, woodworking, Pultrusion, Extrusion, Inspection and CNC equipment to achieve increased efficiency, extended lifetime and reliability, and increased return on high capital investments.     This project receives funding in the European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research Programme under Grant Agreement Number 869991.     Sample Project     The client had to renew a wore down rotor with knife segments for which they didn't have any documentation. With precise 3D scanning of the original and creation of functional CAD model we provided them with data for production of replacement.     The customer has presumed problems with excessive warpage in the stage of tool design. The material is PA66 with 30% of glass fibers. With the help of advanced injection moulding analysis we predicted the trend and values of warpage and thus successfully eliminated the problems.     Our client has planned a single phase deep drawing process for the presented case, however several doubts about manufacturability arose. The conducted analysis has cleared all doubts.     We made a comparative study between experimentaly and numerically determined strength of a fibre reinforced product, which yielded extremely good match of the results from both methods. "

      "text":" Renewables assuming greater role in the EU energy mix, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions     Wind, solar and other renewable energy sources are steadily increasing their share in energy consumption across the European Union, further reducing the need for CO2-emitting fossil fuel energy, according to a report published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today. This trend is driving down greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation, buildings\u2019 heating and cooling, and transport.     The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published its provisional data about the emissions of newly registered passenger cars and vans in Europe in 2020. For cars, the data show a 12 % decrease in average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared with 2019. Average van emissions also decreased slightly, by about 1.5 %.     The coronavirus pandemic has challenged European societies in many ways. The European Environment Agency\u2019s (EEA) briefing, published today, analyses the pandemic\u2019s effect on the use of certain single-use plastics products, which cause greenhouse gas and other emissions and can end up littering the environment. It also brings useful lessons to improve our response to future disruptive events.     Air pollution is a serious problem in many European cities, posing a real risk to health. Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) launched the European city air quality viewer. You can check how the air quality has been over the past two years in the city where you live and compare it with other cities across Europe.     European cities have the potential to lead the way towards green, sustainable future, according to two assessments on urban environmental change, published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.     The annual Bathing Water report published today shows that in 2020, almost 83 % of Europe\u2019s bathing water sites met the European Union\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards. The latest assessment (European bathing water quality in 2020), put together by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in cooperation with the European Commission, is based on the 2020 monitoring of 22 276 bathing sites across Europe. These cover the EU Member States, Albania and Switzerland throughout 2020. "

Museum of Contemporary Art, Lotty Rosenfeld, Martina Ruhsam & Vlado Repnik, \u0160kart, Endre T\u00f3t, Goran Trbuljak, \u017delimir \u017dilnik, a selection of videos from the EVR Archive, and the Museum in the Streets archive     Starting on Friday, 18 January 2013, our exhibition The Present and Presence is on view with a new twist: Repetition 3 - The Street. Works have been added or brought into focus in two rooms on the first floor and on the ground floor of the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova, where you will also find Dan Perjovschi's poster. The film by Nu\u0161a and Sre\u010do Dragan is screened at the Moderna galerija, Cankarjeva 15. The works comprising the Repetition 3 - The Street selection are marked with Dan Perjovschi's stamp.     The exhibition The Present and Presence: Repetition 3 - The Street again focuses on lived time, this time limiting the presentation to the works made in public space - more specifically, in the streets. Included in this new display of works largely from the Moderna galerija national collection and the Arteast 2000+ collection is the archive of the project Museum in the Streets, organized by Moderna galerija in 2008, during the renovation of our main museum building, when no funding was allotted for the exhibitions program.     The reason Repetition 3 is so focused on art in the streets is quite plain. Over the last two years, the streets have, once again, become our other physical body, not only in Slovenia, but all over the world: a physical space where we breathe the same air as the others, where we are relearning to shout, where we write our own placards and pick out favorites among those written by others. After we had, it seemed, teetered on the brink of losing the streets and the squares, when we seemed to have moved into virtual worlds, the physical world has again started to recoup its value. The good old streets are accessible to the poor and the rich alike, to the old and the young, to those on Facebook and those without profiles. Everyone can bring their body, their voice, their thought, and their anger to the streets and the squares; and it works like group therapy, where every gesture, at least momentarily, seems to be effective and to serve some common goal. We have almost forgotten how important it is to express ourselves, and express ourselves with our entire bodies. We are relearning participation, endurance, and repetition. With every demonstration it is becoming increasingly clear that what we are seeing happening in the streets in Slovenia is not merely a revolt against the politics of austerity measures and cuts in public funding, most acutely felt in education, healthcare, and culture. The people in the streets are rebelling against neoliberal autocrats and corrupt(ed) powers that be, and merging into a forum demanding the preservation of the fundamental basis of the democratic state: the rule of law and equality in access to education, healthcare, and culture for all.     During the time of socialist rule, the public manifestations carried out in the streets by the artists from Eastern Europe, whose works are kept in our Arteast 2000+ collection, were gestures for democracy. When three members of the OHO Group draped themselves in black fabric in 1968, to enact, with their bodies unified into one with their three heads sticking out, the three-headed Mt Triglav, a symbol of Slovenia, their act presented a disruption in the gray everyday socialist life in Ljubljana. Tomislav Gotovac protested against the lack of freedom by streaking through the streets of Belgrade, and Milan Kn\u00ed\u017e\u00e1k by inviting passersby to join him in his demonstration by crowing. Endre T\u00f3t staged demonstrations carrying placards with zeros written on them. At a recent demonstration in Ljubljana, the group Irwin carried placards with the circular scheme of the Coca-Cola bottle top and a slogan taken from a campaign for the same beverage: Time for a New State. While T\u00f3t's zeros stood, decades ago, for empty ideological speech, the Coca-Cola bottle-top circles speak of the invisible power of multinational capital. In another totalitarian regime, Lotty Rosenfeld used white tape to make large white crosses in the streets; her performance carried great symbolic weight and meaning under Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile. The Chto Delat? platform organized a visualization of a Brecht poem in St. Petersburg in 2005; the poem was displayed by \"engaged\" sandwich people on the same spot where the Russian Revolution had begun 100 years earlier. During the time of the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime in Serbia, the \u0160kart collective carried out the notorious street action Your Shit - Your Responsibility, and Vlado Repnik and Martina Ruhsam organized the Blank_Protest in 2008, a demonstration without any demands or slogans, representing an \"anomaly in the dictionary of political jargon\".     The Present and Presence: Repetition 3 - The Street also includes the archive of the Museum in the Streets show from 2008. During the renovation of the Moderna galerija's main (and then only) building, the Ministry of Culture did not provide a venue or funding for our public program. For this reason we decided to organize the Museum in the Streets project, to draw attention to our situation: the central national institution for modern and contemporary art was closed for three years and would have remained virtually without program if not for such near-protest projects. That (unsupported) situation has again repeated itself over the past two years since our Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova opened. We now have twice the exhibition space to work in, but not a single additional employee, while our program funds have been reduced to less than the total we were allotted while working in just a single building. The history of street art helps us develop our potential of free creativity under conditions in which art and culture are losing the support and protection that would (otherwise) enable them to carry out their vital public mission.

FOREWORD     Following the conferences of September 2001 and 2002, June and October 2003 - as a part of the long-term project The Origins of Slovenes - there was also a conference in June 2005 titled \"Ancient Settlers of Europe\".     The aim of the latest conference was to collect as many facts, pieces of evidence, and arguments as possible about our distant past up to the period of the great migrations of peoples, which could speak either in favour of the assumption that the ancestors of Slovenes immigrated as a part of those migrations, or that they lived in their present territories long before.     In this way the resulting confrontation of evidence, arguments and comparison of facts should reveal the most probable objective truth about our distant past.     We have foreseen the following main topics and sub-topics:     Archaeological traces:     Pre-Indo-European developments in Europe     Indo-European development up to the Urnfield culture     Urnfield culture, its beginnings, evolution and extension     Pursuing this goal, the conference partially succeeded and its outcome is offered in the present Proceedings. The authors chose the language of their contributions themselves. The abstracts are in English as well as in Slovenian. "

Sipronika participates in the project \"Safety Ambassador\", where our novel multi-colour speed displays have been installed in 13 Slovenian municipalities.     Initiated by the sponsorship of Goodyear Dunlop Sava Tires d.o.o. we designed and installed our multi-color speed displays MHP50 (RGB), which show different content based on measured or displayed speeds, respectively.     In the municipality of Sevnica one of such displays slows down the traffic in the close vicinity of a primary school. When the speed limit 30 km\/h is exceeded bold red colored words \"TOO FAST!\" are displayed and at speeds less than 30 blue and yellow \"THANK YOU!\" shows up.     Currently, the displays of the project \"Safety Ambassador\" are located in the municipalities \u0160en\u010dur and \u0160kofja Loka, but in the short term they will be placed also in the remaining ten Slovenian municipalities.

      "text":" When Hunger and Abundance Meet     The permanent exhibition When Hunger and Abundance Meet presents the eating culture from the 18th to the mid-20th century, when eating habits underwent the greatest changes, since in the 1st half of the 20th century the attitude towards food changed on a cultural level. Throughout the centuries, periods of hunger and prosperity alternated as a result of natural disasters, wars, and economic and political circumstances. Not even the upper classes escaped hunger and want; however, as a rule, the diet of the majority of the population in the past was meagre and was conditioned by the social standing of individual households.     Food is considered a cultural good, which is why the diet of previous periods is treated and understood as an important part of cultural heritage. Culinary art and gastronomy are two fields through which we can come to know cultural heritage; the changes, innovations and contemporary creativity of an individual, a family, group, inhabitants of a specific town, region, etc.; and their everyday and holidays. In societies that are experiencing shortage, food is an especially valued item; however, in the past the fundamental problem was the shortage of foodstuffs and eatables, rather than quality. In the countryside, the strict distinction between holiday dishes or dishes for special occasions and everyday food complied with the norm of a sufficient amount of foodstuffs in the house; anything better than that, was an exception to everyday life. In that time, the bourgeoisie lived differently from the nobility, and, above all, very differently from the peasants in the surrounding area. Every wealthier bourgeois family had its own cook\/housekeeper and special rooms: a dining hall and perhaps a tea room. The bourgeois kitchen wanted to be a representative, family, friendly, and hospitable kitchen on the one hand, and practical, up-to-date, and prudent on the other; it incorporated fresh culinary ideas from other regions and new imported produce. The diet, the eating style and the rules associated with eating habits reflect the status of a specific social group at a specific point in time, its wealth or poverty, its privileged or unprivileged status, its abundance or hunger. The upper classes were also privileged as regards eating habits; there were great differences particularly in food quantity and method of preparation, and in the possession and use of tableware. This is attested by the preserved kitchenware and tableware of various origin, some made by premium manufacturers, with which the homes of the dwellers of coastal towns were furnished.     The ethnological collection presents the Mediterranean bourgeois kitchen and kitchenware for storing, preparing and eating food, whereas the rural Istrian kitchen is presented in the Bardinc House in Lopar. Thus, the objects on display originate from the rural and urban environment, and show the coexistence and influence of one cultural environment on the other. The eating habits and customs from the past and the so-called traditional dishes are an excellent opening topic for discussion, with which we can draw parallels with the modern times and modern topics, such as e.g. traditional dishes in contemporary cuisine or traditional dishes and modern-day diseases (e.g. diabetes and traditional food). In any case, it is a topic that offers a wide range of opportunities for popularising cultural heritage and cooperating with diverse target groups.     The exhibition is divided into three sets: objects for storing foodstuffs, objects for preparing food, and objects for eating food. It is complemented by the didactic programme \"O\u0161terija p'r Bepu in Ju\u0107i\" (Bepo and Ju\u0107a's Inn), which is intended for the youngest visitors; it, and the entire exhibition, was designed by designers Irena Gubanc and Mateja \u0160kofi\u010d. The designers depicted the meal as an integral whole that keeps repeating itself using a circle, which is the primary motif of the formal design of the exhibition. "

      "text":" Posodobitev FVE COVID 35: 14. oktober 2020     14. 10. 2020     Objavljamo novice FVE COVID v izvirniku     Dear Colleagues, Countries across Europe are desperately trying to hold the fast-growing wave of new virus cases at bay, trying to employ targeted closures, regional restrictions, stricter social distancing rules and masks to avoid a second large-scale lockdown. Nevertheless, the Netherlands just went in partial lockdown as did the Czech Republic and Slovakia. While at the beginning of the second wave, hospital admissions kept low, now they are increasing in most countries at a worrying speed. We\u2019re up for a difficult winter, but we are much better prepared than in March. Hereby some of the latest news:     News from Europe:     The European Union on Tuesday adopted new guidelines aimed at coordinating members\u2019 varying travel measures. They will now use a single map with a colour-coded system to show the scale of outbreaks: green (low risk), orange (medium risk) and red (high risk). Other measures include unifying how quarantines and testing are done, and ensuring ample warning when national travel advisories are about to change to ensure that travellers aren\u2019t left stranded. However, the measures are not mandatory, and individual member states reserve the right to take unilateral action, including stepping up restrictions or changing the risk category for regions based on their own assessments. See also factsheet attached.     The European Council will meet on 15-16 October in the Brussels Council building, despite Brussels being dark red. But guess country leaders can use something safer as public transport. To prepare, the general affairs council already met Monday. Many important issues are on the agenda, a discussion with the European Parliament on the EU 7-year budget, the work towards a Brexit deal and how to move towards climate neutrality by 2050 with a potential in-between target of reduction by 55% by 2030.     The circulation of infections in mink farms continue. Currently, 64 of the 120 mink farms in the Netherlands and 76 of the 1136 mink farms in Denmark has been found infected. Denmark, who until recently had used an isolation strategy for infected mink farms, now also moved towards a culling strategy. This led to mink breeders being dissatisfied with the authorities' handling of the killing of their mink that they are now suing the state. The purpose is to ensure better financial compensation and a fair process for the killing of the minks. Despite enormous research, both in the Dutch and Danish outbreaks much around how the animals got infected remains unclear. Other countries who have seen outbreaks in mink farms are Spain and USA.     Telemedicine: in the UK the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) extended temporary remote prescribing to 1 November 2020 with additional safeguards. Remote prescribing should only be carried out by veterinary surgeons who can provide [an out-of-hours] follow-up service involving physical examination. The follow-up service can be provided personally by the veterinary surgeon or practice, or by written agreement with a veterinary services provider which is local to the client. The FVE draft position on telemedicine will be for a vote at our next GA on 6 November.     With infection rates rising, more outbreaks are again seen in slaughterhouses. Some large-scale pig slaughterhouses in North-Germany were ordered to close after rising Covid infections among workers. To deal with capacity shortage and to avoid the need to cull pigs, solutions are being negotiated such as by allowing other slaughterhouses to work longer hours or to increase capacity in alternative slaughterhouses. It would be good for all countries to inventories slaughterhouse capacity to see if some have to close, where extra capacity can be retrieved.     On 29th October 2020, 3-5 pm CET, the World Veterinary Association (WVA) will organise a free WVA Virtual Seminar on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Veterinary Profession. FVE will join the panel discussions. You can see the program and register here: WVA VIRTUAL SEMINAR | THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE VETERINARY PROFESSION \u2013 ONGOING ASSESSMENT     WHO made a nice update on the status of the different COVID vaccines under development. Currently, there are 42 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation of which 10 in Phase III trials. All top candidate vaccines are for intra-muscular injection and all but two need a two-dose schedule. See the presentation attached.     With COVID now very present under the younger generation, universities are struggling on how to best protect its staff and students, e.g. by starting to teach partly or fully online. As we reported in the last COVID mail Li\u00e8ge University in Belgium did something additional, they launched a massive self-screening campaign aiming for all its staff and students. The first results are in: of the 4,477 samples analysed, 69 (4 staff members and 65 students) were positive, a rate of 1.54%. So very low.

Spremljaj nas     Slikovita Vipavska dolina, ki se odpira na zahodu Slovenije, le\u017ei na sti\u010di\u0161\u010du temperamentnega Mediterana in umirjene celinske Evrope, kar ji daje neponovljiv zna\u010daj. Tukaj je \u017ee davnega leta 1894 nastala vinska klet Vipava.     Kronika kleti je razgibana in nelo\u010dljivo povezana z burno preteklostjo Vipavske doline. Poleti 2017 je vajeti kleti in s tem njeno usodo prevzel vinar Hannes Sabathi, doma z avstrijske \u0160tajerske, ki mu stoji ob strani mo\u010dna avstrijsko-slovenska ekipa sodelavcev. Od takrat se pi\u0161e novo poglavje vznemirljive vinske zgodbe.     V ospredju prizadevanj je pridelava najbolj\u0161ih vin, kar jih je mogo\u010de izvabiti iz te pokrajine \u2212 s pristnim zna\u010dajem in jasno prepoznavnostjo porekla. S kletjo Vipava sodeluje 350 vinogradnikov, ki so pri podvigu podjetnega Hannesa Sabathija najpomembnej\u0161i partnerji. \u017de njihovi predniki so skozi generacije skrbno negovali svoje vinograde in skrbeli za to edinstveno kulturno krajino. Danes so prevzeli odgovornost v svoje roke in podprli vizijo ter na\u010drte avstrijskega vinarja in mu ponudili svoje bogate izku\u0161nje in neprecenljivo vinogradni\u0161ko znanje.     Na\u0161o ponudbo smo dopolnili z novo linijo vrhunskih vin - Lanthieri. Opremili smo jih z dvojezi\u010dno etiketo \u2013 v sloven\u0161\u010dini in nem\u0161\u010dini, s \u010dimer poosebljajo \u017elahtno sodelovanje med avstrijskim vinarjem in slovenskimi pridelovalci grozdja.     In the picturesque Vipava Valley in the west of Slovenia, where the Mediterranean south and continental Europe come together in a thrilling fashion \u2013 this is where you will find the cooperative winery Vipava \u2013 rich in tradition, founded in the year 1894.     The winery chronicle is quite colourful, and inseparably bound together with the stormy history of the Vipava Valley itself. Since summer 2017 its viticultural destiny has been under the directorship of Austrian winemaker Hannes Sabathi from the Steiermark, and his Styrian\/Slovenian team. With this, a new era has begun.     Here, attention is focused upon vinifying the best possible wines that the region can yield: authentic of character, with a precise expression of their origins. There are some 350 grape growers \u2013 these individuals are proprietor Hannes Sabathi\u2019s most important partners in this great undertaking. For generations now, the local grape growers have proudly cultivated and cared for the unique cultural landscape of the valley, and now support the vision and plans of the Styrian winemaker with their deep store of experience and viticultural wisdom.     The new labels for the top wines of the Vipava 1894 are composed bilingually in Slovenian and German, and with this represent the close cooperation between the Styrian winemaker and the Slovenian grape growers.     Im malerischen Vipava-Tal im Westen Sloweniens, wo sich der mediterrane S\u00fcden und das kontinentale Europa auf spannende Weise vereinen, liegt die traditionsreiche Kellerei Vipava, gegr\u00fcndet im Jahr 1894.     Die Chronik der Kellerei ist bunt und untrennbar mit der bewegten Geschichte des Vipava Tales verbunden. Seit Sommer 2017 leitet der steirische Weinmacher Hannes Sabathi mit seinem steirisch-slowenischen Team die vinophilen Geschicke der Kellerei. Damit hat eine neue \u00c4ra begonnen.     Das Augenmerk liegt darauf, die besten Weine zu keltern, die das Gebiet hervorzubringen vermag: authentisch und mit pr\u00e4ziser Herkunftscharakteristik. Rund 350 Weinbauern sind bei diesem gro\u00dfen Vorhaben die wichtigsten Partner von Hannes Sabathi. Seit Generationen pflegen sie mit Stolz die einzigartige Kulturlandschaft des Tales und unterst\u00fctzen die Visionen des steirischen Weinmachers mit ihrem Erfahrungsreichtum.     Die neuen Etiketten f\u00fcr die Top-Weine der Kellerei sind in Slowenisch und Deutsch verfasst und stellen so die enge Zusammenarbeit zwischen dem Steirer und den slowenischen Weinbauern dar. "

      "text":" 20th International Symposium on Electronics in Transport     LINKING PEOPLE WITH ITS     March 26th and 27th 2012 at Ljubljana Exhibition and Convention Centre, Ljubljana, Slovenia     Slovenian ITS Association under umbrella of the Electrotechnical Association of Slovenia will organize the jubilee 20th International Symposium on Electronics in Transport \u2013 ISEP which promotes the strategic objective of integrating and strengthening the European Research Area in Slovenia as well as in the other member States, Accession States and in some nearby countries. The Symposiums\u2019 2012 theme is \u201cLinking People with ITS\u201d. This theme brings focus to the importance of planning, developing and using innovative traffic infrastructure and vehicles in the way that they will cooperate with different telematics applications especially to provide critical information to existing riders and encourage non-riders to became public transport users. Intelligent Transport Systems and Services continue to be deployed across Europe at an increasing pace for all modes of transport. But, the current ITS, logistics or public transport solutions cannot meet the challenges modern society is facing today. Therefore, some questions could be addressed: Can sustainable transport profit lesser road user charges, and if so, is ITS the means to measure this? How can we help public authorities to develop an integrated view on ITS, including its strategy development? Is the right next step: \u201cmulti-modal, mobile, networked, pervasive, ... with a particular business model\u201d? On the other hand, it is of great importance to establish a research network of Slovenia and nearby countries in the area of ITS and tie it to the European and regional research. Each of you will come with your own aspirations to the Symposium will share them with old and new colleagues. Unique to this event is the encouragement of participation by PhD students who are involved in current state-of-the-art transport research and practical issues concerning ITS. The symposium will give PhD students the opportunity to present their PhD work to a knowledgeable audience. At the same time, it will offer the opportunity for the presentation of achievements of Slovene and foreign researchers. Further, the symposium gives participants from ministries, universities, research organisations and industry the opportunity to establish personal contacts with the aim of stimulating the efficient transfer of research results to the market, according to the needs and expectations of users of all modes of transportation. The aim of the symposium is also to encourage dialogue and cooperation among the participants who are involved in solving the problems and looking for common solutions. ISEP Symposium is focusing on the following topics:     ITS technologies in and for all modes of transport,     Policy, strategy and standards for future ITS,     The role of ITS in railways, air and maritime traffic, "

Weapons and army equipment form the material base of the battle strength and have significant impact on battle forces distribution. In the present paper I present the armament, ammunition and explosive devices in the motorized company of the Slovenian army. I study the aims, general characteristics, tactical and technical characteristics of the specific weapons and I compare them between two different eras: of the newly attained independence of Slovenia and nowadays. Based on this information, as well as my own experience in the Slovenian army, I draw certain conclusions. I propose some suggestions and possible solutions for the future armament of the motorized troops in the Slovenian army. "

Article analyses the suitability of the legal regulation of tax advisory services in relation to their quality; it is based on comparative analysis of the (non)regulation of tax advisory services in selected EU states, analysis of the existing regulatory framework in Slovenia, as well as on the opinions of stakeholders. Based on the results of all three analyses, we propose an optimal model of regulation of the profession and the level of regulation, centred on the need to ensure quality services for clients, service providers, the state and society as a whole. The key finding is that greater regulation would improve the quality of tax advisory services, which is not only important for clients of services. It is also in the public interest, as it increases confidence in tax returns and financial statements prepared by tax advisors, which in turn improves the economy and mitigates operative risks.     Keywords: tax, tax advisory services, regulated professions, quality of services.     JEL: H2, M4, G28, E6     Full article is available in Slovenian language.

Living lab approach supports cooperation between business-citizens and government, building on existing territorial capital (people, knowledge, assets). Approach is underlining importance of:     early engagement of end-users into a co-creation process     bridging the innovation gap between technology development and the uptake of new products and services     early assessment of the socio-economic impacts of newly developed technologies     Approach is built on three main axes:     Examination of existing regional policy framework     Identifying most appropriate ICT platforms and services tested through PILOT projects     Development of multi-level governance models for a permanent network structure     In the framework of project activities, 10 partners, coming from 8 European countries, explore potential contributions of open innovation approach on 2 levels:     On policy level, with an aim to prepare policy recommendations, what could living labs contribute in building regional development policy.     On implementation level, with 10 pilot LL projects initiatives in 10 policy \/ thematic fields: energy, eco-tourism, micro-SMEs networks, media and creativity, environment & education, climate change, waste management, rural development, e-health.     To have a common approach and framework for development and implementation of pilots, a common pilot methodology called LEADERS is developed. Methodology has 7 steps, guiding the regional coordinator in building transnational living lab. The purpose of methodology is self and comparative assessment of LL.     Final conference     Final CENTRALAB conference, hosted by 27th Bled eConference, named Ecosystems     In the framework of 27th Bled eConference, titled Ecosystems, which was organized between 1st and 5th of June 2014, we hosted a final project conference of project CentraLab- Central European Living Lab for Territorial Innovation.     Final project conference was dedicated to sharing experience and challenges in the field of open innovation approach, with the purpose of presenting variety of initiatives, projects and business fields where approach can be used. Presenters from Austria, France, Italy and Portugal shared their views about methods of open innovation, social innovation and co-creation in their regions. Program was thematically split in two parts. In the framework of first part speakers presented different experience by using co-designed methods.     Mr Hans-Dieter Zimmermann, presented challenges and potential solutions in the framework of the eSociety Bodensee 2020 Project, focusing on open societal innovation examples. Mr Zimmermann presented how can developed open social innovation solutions contribute to quality of living in the Lake Constance region. In the framework of eSociety Bodensee project 2020, results of TOSIT - The Open Societal Innovation Toolbox was developed which helps involved stakeholders to identify and implement pilot projects in regional society.     Martin Duval presented How to implement Open and Collaborative Innovation? What is open and collaborative innovation? How to use open and collaborative? Why open innovation is useful, characteristics, ICT tools to support open innovation approach, presentation of good practice examples of how to implement open innovation.     Andrea Busato from Scuola Italiana Design -PST Galileo, Italy gave an interesting insight about'SID ROVINJ WORKSHOP': high-powered creative experience for SMEs, which have been implemented 16 years so far, supporting collaboration among CEOs, employees and students of industrial design to find new innovative solutions. Mr Busato stressed the importance of collaboration between different participants and explained that SMEs want to participate because of following reasons: lots of ideas born in short time (1 week), available young creativity (engaging students), deconditioned creativity, creative experience which are not available in office environment.     A presentation from mr Christian Kittl followed demonstrating the use of co-creatinginnovation in a mobile Living Lab. Living lab is organized in the framework of competence center for research and development in the area of mobile communication and innovation, involving research and business partners with the mission of enabling mobile innovation. Main areas of research are:     Mobile Processes (Mobile Payment, Mobile CRM),     Mobile Social Media & User Interaction,     Media convergence (Internet of Things, Augmented Reality),     Living Lab and Open Innovation.     To involve stakeholders following tools developed and tested: web platform, mobile applications enabling stakeholders to upload their ideas, diaries, chats, sketches, responses.     Last presentation of the first part included presentation of the UPSIDE project (User-driven Participatory Solutions for Innovation in Digitally-centred Ecosystems) given by Dr. Ralf Trunko. Dr Trunko emphasized that project is focused on delivering economic and societal benefits by fostering the emergence and development of user-driven participatory solutions in identifying innovation. Project is implemented by 5 clusters which will test innovative solutions in the framework of pilot projects (test beds) in following fields: health, mobility, public services and energy.     Part two of the final conference was dedicated to policy issues related to innovation. 3 speakers mr Jesse Marsh, mr Christian Kittl and mr \u00c1lvaro de Oliveira presented and comment how innovation activities are positioned in programmes of territorial innovation, Danube Region Strategy and how can innovation policy be integrated between Horizon 2020 Programme and Regional Innovation Policy. Their presentations open a discussion about variety of issues burdening modern society and way of living and gave a good closure what could be future innovation challenges. "

The physical characteristics, especially the shallowness and its semi-enclosed nature, make the Adriatic and Ionian Sea even more vulnerable to these threats. These problems highlight the need for global planning and management of coastal marine areas in the Adriatic-Ionian region.     The idea for the PORTODIMARE project is based on implemented projects (SHAPE, ADRIPLAN). The aim of the project itself is to continue the activities carried out so far in these projects and to develop a maritime spatial plan for the area of \u200b\u200bthe Adriatic-Ionian region.     The goal of the PORTODIMARE project is to create a common platform - the Geoportal, which will provide access to all informations, data and tools that are necessary and important to support the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and strategic maritime planning in the Adriatic-Ionian region. The platform will operate in full compliance with the policies and principles of the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and will support the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region- EUSAIR.     The project is divided on 4 main work packages:     M- Management     The work package includes the preparation of all acts and statutory documents, ongoing management of project activities, financial management, reporting and archiving and self-assessment of project results.     T1 \u2013 Geoportal design and development     The first work package includes the creation and development of a database for the Geoportal.     T2 \u2013 Geoportal testing and demonstration: towards the plan     The second work package include the testing and the demonstration of the Geoportal.     C-Communication     As part of the communication work package, the promotion of tools, good practices and the knowledge acquired in the implemented projects will take place.     The regional development center Koper will be actively involved in all project work packages through various activities. Within the T1 work unit, it will carry out individual activities such as the T1.2 activity, which aims to determine the data needed for maritime spatial planning and the use of the protocol on integrated coastal zone management in the Mediterranean.

In addition to the application, a back-end was developed. It is used for storing measurements sent from sensors via the API interface. The mobile application was built using the Ionic framework, which uses Angular and Apache Cordova to build hybrid mobile applications. It allows a user to access data from several databases, namely from a preexisting local database, direct connection to sensors using MQTT and from our own back-end database. The back-end is implemented with Docker-Compose, which connects all of the components packed up in Docker containers. Each container is implemented with different technology, depending on its role. Node.Js is used for API, Eclipse Mosquitto as an MQTT broker, phpPgAdmin for quick database access and PostgreSQL for a database. The thesis also describes different approaches to creating hybrid applications, shows their advantages and compares them. "

In the Slovenian army we can't found entire analyze of current system of support with uniforms and proposals how to solve the deficiency. Partial brief analyze of current system of support with uniforms with proposal of solutions was prepared by PSSV\/G4 in the year 2011. We can't find other research on that field until present, so we tried with scientific methods to found out real reasons of deficiency of current logistic support system with uniforms and to give some proposals hot to fix deficiency.

With such setup you can listen to your RIG with phones or loud speaker without affecting DATA IN level with volume control. MIC GAIN control still affecting modulation level (leave it the same as for SSB \u2013 10 o'clock), but MIC input is disabled. You can adjust modulation level and audio input level from WSJT (menu Options on SpectJT) on your PC. Please, use standard interfaces for PTT, AUDIO and modulation.

This project aims to help create more transparency and synergy over admission processes at Master\u2019s level in Europe, and is co-funded by the European Commission\u2019s Erasmus+ programme, and more specifically its Strategic Partnerships Key Action in the Netherlands. The project wants to support the increasing number of Master\u2019s coordinators and directors who want to improve their admissions and seek assistance in that process. It will do so by bringing together, in regional focus groups and other types of gatherings, experts in admission matters and Master\u2019s coordinators who have already developed good practices or are keenly in need to change their practice. Based on these interactions and exchanges, as well as on the reports, a set of tools will be developed and made available so that many more Master\u2019s coordinators can build tailor-made competence-based selection.
