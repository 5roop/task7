It was nominated from the floor . I must admit , I went in thinking \" fiscal cliff \" had this hands down . I thought there was no way anything would beat that , but fiscal cliff did n't even make the runoff . It was hashtag vs. marriage equality . <p> Rina : Why hashtag ? <p> Anne : The argument was that while the word hashtag has been around since 2007 , this was the year of the hashtag . This was the year that hashtag was everywhere in the Twittersphere and beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making memes go viral . <p> Rina : And what were the winners in some of the other categories ? <p> Anne : Marriage equality , which was in the runoff for word of the year , actually won most likely to succeed . And I thought it was a very interesting entry . The argument was that as the country has changed its attitudes about marriage equality , we 've seen the terminology shift from same-sex marriage or gay marriage to marriage equality . And people pointed out that when textbooks write this up as a movement , it will be about the movement for marriage equality . <p> Rina : Tell us about some of the other categories . <p> Anne : One of my favorites , most years , is the most creative word of the year . And there were two terrific candidates this year . One is \" mansplaining , \" which is defined as a man 's condescending explanation to a female audience . It 's designed to capture a certain kind of male behavior . It did mean that during the discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking because they could easily be accused of mansplaining every time they tried to say anything , even though it was a mixed-gender audience . <p> Rina : That 's never happened to me , has it to you , Anne ? <p> Anne : No , never . <p> The mansplaining was up against \" gate lice \" -- a description of passengers on an airplane who crowd around the gate waiting to board . <p> Rina : I love that ! <p> Anne : I loved it , too , and I particularly liked the singular , which is gate louse . <p> Rina : And who does n't know that ? Maybe we 've even been a louse . <p> Anne : And now we have such a great way to talk about it . We can say , \" Look at all the gate lice . \" <p> Rina : There 's also the most unnecessary and the most outrageous categories . Those are more serious . <p> Anne : They are more serious . And this year the same phrase won in both categories . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate candidate Todd Akins . And someone pointed out when we were voting for most unnecessary , that it came up again under most outrageous on the ballot . And someone yelled out , \" It should win both . \" And it did . <p> Rina : And which word was least likely to succeed ? <p> Anne : That was a tie . One of the first I remember . It was a tie between \" YOLO , \" which our listeners over about 25 or 30 may be less familiar with . It is an acronym for \" you only live once . \" It came to prominence this year from the rapper , Drake . He had a song in which he talked about you only live once -- YOLO -- and I think there are a number of young people who got YOLO tattoos , which they are going to come to regret , because students tell me it is already very unhip . <p> YOLO tied with \" phablet , \" which is apparently a mid-sized electronic device between a smart phone and a tablet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne : For the most useful , we had two combining forms . \" Pocalypse \" or \" mageddon , \" which you 'll hear people attach to things like \" snowmaggedon \" or \" oilpocalypse \" to describe a huge oil spill as a hyperbolic way to talk about a catastrophe . <p> Rina : There had to be something that came out of the elections . <p> Anne : The election phrase of the year is \" binders full of women . \" After presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that , it instantly became a hashtag , and many people have probably seen it circulating online .

        "text":"<h> A sublime croissant at French Tart in Grant City , Staten Island . <p> French Tart chef Laurent Chavenet claims to work in the only authentic French cafe and restaurant in Staten Island . And he just might be right . Opened in 2009 , French Tart is one of those hidden gems that food lovers so often hear about in the outer boroughs , but so rarely find . Baked fresh every morning by Chavenet himself , the croissants are a work of art . The texture runs from crispy on the outside to soft and airy on the inside . According to Chavenet , the secret to making a great croissant is in quality ingredients , especially the butter , and the folding of the dough , which Chavenet demonstrates on a napkin . While the plain croissant is outstanding , the almond croissant is truly world-class . Moist , sweet and decadent , it 's more of a dessert than a breakfast item , but go ahead and dig in any time of day . After all , life is short . Eat dessert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colson Patisserie , in Park Slope , uses two types of flour in its croissants . <p> In 1986 , pastry chef Hubert Colson first opened his famed pastry shop in Mons , Belgium . Barely 20 years later , Yonatan Israel , a French filmmaker searching for structure and opportunity in life , opened his own shop as a tribute to his favorite pastry chef . And so the Park Slope outpost of Colson Patisserie was born . What a gift for pastry lovers in Brooklyn ! Colson 's croissants ( $2.45 ) seem light enough to float above the table and rich enough to melt in your mouth . Two types of flour are used in the dough , which is then folded six to eight times . Eighty croissants are made daily for the pastry shop , which is small but well-lit by a storefront of large windows . Sweet but not candied , these croissants taste like a big puff of flaky butter , which is just what every New Yorker needs to start off their day . As Israel says , \" New York is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change that . \" <p> You ca n't talk about croissants in New York City without mentioning master pastry chef Laurent Dupal and his Spring St. shop Ceci-Cela . Since his quaint cafe opened in 1992 , Dupal has consistently made some of the flakiest , butteriest , airiest croissants ( $2 ) in the five boroughs . Dupal credits fresh ingredients , a controlled setting and years of experience for the excellent taste of his croissants , hundreds of which are sold a day in the patisserie . In fact , Dupal compares baking croissants with raising a child . \" Everyone does it differently , \" he says , \" and , no matter what , you have to adjust to the temperament of the dough , which ca n't be too thin or too thick . \" Take some home for the whole family . A pack of six frozen croissants costs $7 and can be baked at home . <p> YOUR TWO CENTS <p> The croissant at Chock Full o ' Nuts Cafe ( 1611 Avenue M , Brooklyn ) is very buttery inside and outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good with a side of butter\/jelly along with a cup of regular or flavored coffee or chai latte or tea .

        "title":"Reflecting on a quarter-century of growth in Portland's performing ...\n",
        "text":"<h> Reflecting on a quarter-century of growth in Portland 's performing arts scene <p> The highlight of the Portland Center for Performing Arts ' grand-opening in 1987 was a performance by high-wire artists Phillippe Petit and Ann Seward , which reflected the thrilling risk the city had taken with the project . Steven Nehl\/The Oregonian <p> Stephanie Mulligan , who has been with Artists Repertory Theatre since the mid 1980s , knew the Portland theater scene in its younger , wilder days . \" There were more trails of glitter than there are today -- I mean that literally , \" she says . \" I like to think there was a lot more nudity , but that might just be a trick of memory . \" <p> These days , Portland theater , and the city 's arts scene in general , is n't so stripped down . But it is much more glittery , if not literally than metaphorically . Look around and you 'll see it : the sparkle of widespread creative activity , the shine of technical and artistic quality . <p> There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music -- most definitely in food , if you want to extend the definition of the creative culture -- and perhaps in other areas as well , this is Portland 's golden age . Sure , the city 's artsy eccentricities can grow ripe for lampooning , as the TV spoof \" Portlandia \" has proved . But such attention would be nonsensical ( or at least much more embarrassing ) if there was n't more going on here than adult kickball leagues and mustache-growing contests , if many of the eccentrics were n't really artists . <p> A certain shoestring flamboyance , as Mulligan 's recollections of leaner times suggest , is nothing new here . But the size , scope and solidity of the arts in Portland is something that 's grown over the past quarter century . <p> That 1987 and ' 88 marked a pivotal time in Portland arts was clear even then . More than a decade of planning and haggling was coming to fruition . The idea for a set of new performance spaces began taking place around 1976 due to dissatisfaction with Civic Auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying venue ) . In 1981 , voters passed a $19 million bond issue . Next came political squabbles , cost overruns ( from $25 million to $41 million by the time it opened ) and a scramble to find money for operating costs . But eventually the Civic was joined by the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall ( a refurbished 1928 movie palace ) and a new multi-use building next door . <p> \" Ten or 20 years from now , few will remember all the effort , dreaming , planning and yes , the bickering , mistakes and accusations that marked the creation of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts , \" The Oregonian 's Joan Laatz wrote in August , 1987 , when the multi-use New Theater Building ( now named Antoinette Hatfield Hall ) opened . <p> Meanwhile , city officials had been looking for an anchor tenant to take up residence in the center 's the 900-seat space now known as the Newmark Theatre . A study commissioned by the Fred Meyer Trust concluded that not even the city 's top existing theater company , Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizationally . Cynthia Fuhrman , a veteran theater marketing exec , recalls that Portland was the largest city in the country that did n't have a company in the League of Resident Theatres , the association of major regional theaters . After being courted on and off for years , Ashland 's Oregon Shakespeare Festival signed on , and its new satellite operation , dubbed Portland Center Stage , stepped into the lights in Nov. 1988 . <p> After seeing the new company in the new building , Time magazine said that Portland at last could stake a claim to sophistication and social significance . ' ' <p> More so than social stature , the goal was for the PCPA to both bring more touring talents to town and give local troupes a comfortable home that would help them grow their audiences , and for PCS to provide a model of quality , stability and professionalism that might lift the community as a whole . The fear was that higher production costs in the new facilities would make things tougher for most local arts companies , and that the venerable OSF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> \" There was so much buzz about OSF coming up , \" recalls Beth Harper , who 'd soon launch what 's now called Portland Actors Conservatory . \" I was in a show at New Rose and everyone felt like , ' The big guys are coming and we 've never got that kind of attention . ' \" \" One of the things that still rings true , \" Harper adds , \" is the big boys are still the big boys and the small ones are still the small ones . \" <p> Though perhaps not . Yes , Center Stage , which split from OSF to become an independent company in 1994 , remains atop the theatrical food chain . What were the largest or most active homegrown companies back in the late ' 80s -- Portland Rep , New Rose , Storefront Portland Civic Theater -- long ago folded . ( As Mulligan recalls , \" It took about five years for the dust to settle -- unfortunately the dust was some fine companies . \" ) And as it did then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage a few shows a year in rented or makeshift spaces . <p> Numerous factors are involved , not just the anchoring effects of PCPA and PCS , but the theater scene now has a broader range of companies . Artists Repertory Theatre , once a scrappy little operation in rented space at the downtown YWCA , grew to become the city 's No. 2 company , with a $2.4 million budget and its own twin-auditorium home . Down the scale in budget , but punching above their weight artistically , Third Rail Rep , Portland Playhouse and Profile Theatre form a strong middle tier . <p> However persistent the funding challenges of the dance world , a similar vertical growth , if you will , can be found . In the late ' 80s , Portland had both Ballet Oregon and Pacific Ballet Theatre ; for contemporary dance , Portland State University housed a concert series for touring groups and a top-notch resident company . Now , Oregon Ballet Theatre ( the result of a merger of the aforementioned ballet troupes ) survives , White Bird does concert presenting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polaris Dance Theatre each have performance spaces and expanding reputations . <p> \" I think the arts scene was like a young teenager then and has grown up a lot , \" says Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council executive director Eloise Damrosch , who moved to Portland in ' 87 . \" Our reputation as a place to visit has really skyrocketed . I 'm struck when I open up the A&amp;E and see all the options . There 's a lot more happening , and such a range . \" <p> Quantity is n't the only thing that 's changed . <p> \" Back then , there was this grittier , shoestring quality that imbued almost every company , \" Mulligan says . \" The dedication to art was inspiring ... But when I look back at that earlier renaissance of the ' 80s , the truth was the talent pool of the city needed to step up . \" <p> Jim Fullan , who has worked in marketing at Portland Opera and the Oregon Symphony , says the city has developed a \" radically different sense of our place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an inferiority complex regarding Seattle , San Francisco and Los Angeles that it distrusted artistic ambition . \" The public would punish you for getting too big for your britches . The prevailing attitude was , ' It 's good enough for us . We like it . ' Now , that 's totally gone . It 's almost the opposite . If you 're not aspiring to be world-class , you 're not on the boat . The arts -- in tandem with food , beer and wine -- have raised us up . \" <p> The building of the PCPA has n't solved all of the performance-space issues for local companies ( there 's a big , problematic gap between the 900-seat Newmark and the Schnitzer and Keller , which seat close to 3,000 ) . And it 's notable that Center Stage had to move to a home of its own , a renovated 19th-century armory in the Pearl District , to begin fulfilling its potential as a truly vibrant hub for the theater scene . But those two big moves have , over time , proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other developments have helped shape the Portland of today . Some observers point to the fundraising success of John and Lucy Buchanan at the Portland Art Museum 1994 to 2005 . \" They actually made a case that a great city needs great art , \" says BodyVox co-founder Jamey Hampton . \" And that put a gauntlet down . \" <p> Leadership changes in 2003 at Portland Opera , Oregon Ballet Theatre and the Oregon Symphony also marked a crucial transition . Hampton points to Tom Manley , president of Pacific Northwest College of Art as \" probably the best leader of an arts organization the city has . \" PNCA has grown to be a leading creative and economic force in the Pearl District ... and it 's in the process of remaking how that neighborhood looks . It 's not splashy , like when Pink Martini plays New Year 's Eve at the Schnitz . It 's quiet , but it 's really foundational . \" <p> Through it all , the essential challenges remain much the same : make good work , expand audiences , cultivate donors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business model , away from a focus on big-money patrons and toward building long-term relationships with supporters of all sorts , nurturing them along the path from first-time ticket buyer to subscriber to contributor and so on . Others point out that the city is awash in heavily subsidized art -- but that the artists themselves provide the subsidy comes from the artists themselves , in the form of the second jobs , lack of health care , or multiple roommates that allow them to subsist as artists . <p> All together , what 's changed and what 's stayed the same add up to an arts scene that , while still facing major challenges , has grown bigger , wider and better integrated into the world around it . <p> \" I do n't think it happens in isolation , \" Fuhrman says . \" It 's about the growth of the city as a whole . \" ",

' ' <p> more so than social stature , the goal was for the pcpa to both bring more touring talents to town and give local troupes a comfortable home that would help them grow their audiences , and for pcs to provide a model of quality , stability and professionalism that might lift the community as a whole . the fear was that higher production costs in the new facilities would make things tougher for most local arts companies , and that the venerable osf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> \" there was so much buzz about osf coming up , \" recalls beth harper , who 'd soon launch what 's now called portland actors conservatory . \" i was in a show at new rose and everyone felt like , ' the big guys are coming and we 've never got that kind of attention .

Now , as then , it 's all about your questions and our community 's answers . We occasionally dig into our question bag , provide our own take , then tap the wisdom of our readers . To submit your own question , see our helpful tips page . <p> I ask , because I want to use Facebook to create a historical timeline about an ancestor in my family so people can learn more about their heritage . I have Googled my question several times and all answers are confusing and mixed : some say everything stays on a FB page until you clean it off and others say Facebook deletes status updates and photos monthly . <p> This is an interesting way to use Facebook -- to create a page for someone who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . ( Typically , the question is the other way around : what to do with someone 's existing Facebook account after they pass away ? ) And given the level of confusion constantly floating around about Facebook 's data retention policies , it 's no surprise that it might be hard to pinpoint exactly when ( if ever ) information gets deleted from the social network . <p> We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others , including those described above . Typically , information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted . For certain categories of data , we may also tell you about specific data retention practices . <p> Just to be sure , we reached out to Facebook to confirm this is indeed the policy for the above use case . The company confirmed that as long as you have not deleted the content yourself -- or in the case of a message between two people , both people have not deleted it -- the content should stay online indefinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep in mind about this policy . If you ever do want to delete the content , you should know that it 's not likely to disappear instantly . As you may remember , we followed a thread for several years over how fast photos are deleted from Facebook 's servers once you delete them from the site ; as of late 2012 , we verified that photos indeed appear to be removed within 30 days of deletion ( our tests showed they were actually removed much faster ) . <p> It 's not just about photos , though . As outlined in the same Data Use Policy referenced above , there are major differences between deactivating an account versus deleting an account , should you choose to eventually remove the account you created for your ancestor . Many Facebook users mistakenly think that deactivating their accounts equals deletion , but that is not so : <p> Deactivating your account puts your account on hold . Other users will no longer see your timeline , but we do not delete any of your information . Deactivating an account is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future . You can deactivate your account on your account settings page . <p> Your friends will still see you listed in their list of friends while your account is deactivated . <p> So when you deactivate your ancestor 's account , it 's not really going anywhere . The data is still there , lurking somewhere on Facebook 's servers , even if the \" friends \" of that account can no longer see it . <p> Deletion , however , is another matter : <p> When you delete an account , it is permanently deleted from Facebook . It typically takes about one month to delete an account , but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days . You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it . <p> ... <p> Certain information is needed to provide you with services , so we only delete this information after you delete your account . Some of the things you do on Facebook are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group or sending someone a message ( where your friend may still have a message you sent , even after you delete your account ) . That information remains after you delete your account . <p> I often see Facebook users confusing these two things . They usually become alarmed when they 've deactivated an account , only to have all the old information show up again when they go to \" register \" a new account . But if you actually go through with a real deletion , the information should n't be there past 90 days -- and hopefully it will be gone sooner . ",

The news service reported that he said nothing during a Thursday hearing at the Melbourne Magistrates Court . <p> A lawyer for Chichakli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almustafa . Chichakli was held pending the processing of a U.S. extradition request . <p> Victoria state police spokeswoman Jessica Rosewarne confirmed Chichakli was caught after applying for the government post . <p> \" He was identified as a person of interest through routine background checks as part of the application process , \" she said . \" He had not been offered employment with Victoria police or started any training . \" <p> U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara , the chief federal prosecutor in New York , said Chichakli \" consorted with the world 's most notorious arms trafficker in the purchase of aircraft that would be used to transport weapons to some of the world 's bloodiest conflict zones , in violation of international sanctions . \" <p> Michele M. Leonhart , administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration , said the international law enforcement community has long recognized Chichakli as a key criminal facilitator in Bout 's global weapons trafficking regime . <p> \" His arrest means the world is safer and more secure , \" she said in a release . <p> Merchant of Death Bout is a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 1990s-era notoriety for running a fleet of aging Soviet-era cargo planes to conflict-ridden hotspots in Africa . He also inspired the arms dealer character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 film \" Lord of War . \" <p> An indictment against Chichakli in U.S. District Court in Manhattan and other court documents accuse Chichakli of working as a close associate of Bout since at least the mid-1990s to assemble a fleet of cargo planes capable of shipping weapons and military equipment to various parts of the world , including Africa , South America and the Middle East . <p> Prosecutors say the arms have helped fuel conflicts and support regimes in Afghanistan , Angola , The Democratic Republic of the Congo , Liberia , Rwanda , Sierra Leone and Sudan . <p> Over the years , Chichakli has weaved a colorful biography of his past but often repudiated his comments under the glare of law enforcement scrutiny . <p> He has claimed to have befriended a young Osama bin Laden during college days at Riyadh University in Saudi Arabia . He also claimed a stint in the U.S. Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf War . <p> The indictment accuses Chichakli and Bout of violating sanctions by arranging to buy two Boeing aircraft from U.S. companies in 2007 . It says they electronically transferred more than $1.7 million through banks in New York and into bank accounts in the U.S. , though the money was blocked by the U.S. Department of the Treasury before it reached the aviation companies ' accounts . <p> The Treasury Department had imposed an asset freeze against Chichakli in April 2005 as part of larger financial sanctions aimed at the Bout network 's dealings with the dictatorial regime of Liberian President Charles Taylor .

        "text":"<p> Syrian women far outnumber men in the refugee camps in neighboring Jordan . A new report by the International Rescue Committee says that gender-based violence in Syria is one of the main causes of women fleeing the country , and that reports of rape and violence against women are on the rise . In a clinic catering to Syrian refugees on the Jordanian border , a psychologist says she is shocked by some of the stories she hears of public rapes and torture . <p> MELISSA BLOCK , HOST : <p> You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News . <p> A recent report by the International Rescue Committee sheds light on an alarming trend in Syria , a surge in sexual violence . Rape is a significant and disturbing feature of the Syrian war , according to the IRC report , which was based on interviews with hundreds of Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon . The report includes the stories of a 9-year-old girl who was raped and of a father who shot his own daughter to prevent her from being , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jordan that provides counseling for some of these victims . She sent this report . <p> SHEERA FRENKEL , BYLINE : In a small apartment on a nondescript street in the Jordanian city of Ramthe , Syrian refugees come to get help . The clinic is run by the International Rescue Committee , and it 's a place where Syrian refugees share their stories of horror and war . <p> FRENKEL : The women in the clinic asked that their identities be kept private to protect themselves and their families . Saher , a 42-year-old mother , comes each week with her 18-month-old baby . She says she fled Syria when soldiers ransacked her home and put a gun to her infant daughter 's head . <p> SAHER : ( Through Translator ) I told them there was no man in the house , so please do n't come in . They pushed me down . I begged for mercy . They started to say bad words , and I began to cry . <p> FRENKEL : Saher does n't say what happened next . Instead , she speaks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAHER : ( Through Translator ) Yes , there was rape , and they would even kidnap a woman if her relative is a defector . They would take his sister or his wife . In Daraa , that really happened . <p> FRENKEL : Nawall Mohammed is the psychologist who leads the weekly sessions with Saher and others . Previously , she worked with Iraqi and Palestinian refugees , but she says she 's never heard stories that affected her as much as those from the Syrian refugees . <p> NAWALL MOHAMMED : I remember a client . He is a man , Syrian man . He said the army , they collect the women , just the women and girls , and they took off their clothes and put them in big cars in the streets in front of their relatives and husbands and brothers naked . So it is like their weapon . <p> FRENKEL : Nawall says that the women find it easier to share their stories when they can attribute them to other people . Some of the stories are about rape by soldiers or security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their families have suddenly become refugees . Melanie Megevand oversees the programs for female refugees for the International Rescue Committee . In the IRC 's report , the New York-based NGO revealed that women gave sexual violence as a primary reason for fleeing Syria . <p> MELANIE MEGEVAND : Given the cultural taboos , particularly in the context of the Middle East , it 's been extremely telling to hear so many stories of sexual violence occurring and having that being explained by both men and women , including children . <p> FRENKEL : Saher says that she never thought she would become a refugee , and it scares her to think about what 's happening back in her hometown of Daraa . She says she 's heard from neighbors that her home has been destroyed . She 's thankful that she got her family out in time . <p> SAHER : ( Through Translator ) We only have our own dignity . A house is a minor thing , but our dignity is a basic thing . That 's the reason that pushed us to come to Jordan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daraa and rebuild one day .

Some admirably recognizable talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V\/H\/S contributor Adam Wingard , Down Terrace and Sightseers director Ben Wheatley , recent Sundance breakout director Jorge Michel Grau ( We Are What We Are ) , Timo Tjahjanto ( whose \" Safe Haven \" short was a disturbingly memorable contribution to the upcoming S-VHS ) and cult favorite Yoshihiro Nishimura of Tokyo Gore Police . <p> Running times vary from just a few minutes to as many as six or seven , forcing the filmmakers to significantly compress their often gruesome narratives . Both the originality and quality of the shorts are equally variable , with the majority coming off as mere genre exercises rather than fully conceived films . Leading off with the first letter of the Roman alphabet , Nacho Vigalondo 's \" Apocalypse \" is n't nearly as ominous as the title suggests , focusing on a housewife who bloodily dispatches her bedridden husband after unsuccessfully poisoning him for months , impatient for him to meet his demise . <p> With the possible exception of \" Dogfight , \" Marcel Sarmiento 's gritty take on a cage fighter who battles a vicious dog barehanded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iguchi , the series does n't really hit its stride until about halfway through , with Tjahjanto 's \" Libido . \" Strapped down in heavy wooden chairs , two captive men are forced to pleasure themselves for a masked audience while watching various live sex acts , with the second-place finisher summarily and grotesquely executed . Shot in an urgent , feverish style , the wan , desaturated color scheme sharply contrasts with the extremity of the men 's dire predicament . <p> \" Nuptials \" from Banjong Pisanthanakun , the Thai director of horror film Shutter , injects some welcome humor into the grim proceedings . A young man presents his unimpressed girlfriend with a colorful parakeet as a gift , but when the bird voices her boyfriend 's wedding proposal and he proffers a ring , she interrupts her meal preparation to show her appreciation . The bird , however , has more to reveal , repeating a conversation that apparently took place between the man and his secret lover during a recent tryst , a disclosure that quickly enrages the knife-wielding girlfriend . Pisanthanakun adopts a style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing contrast to the rapidly escalating onscreen violence . <p> Among the animated shorts , which include the bizarre \" Hydro-Electric Diffusion \" and the trifling \" Klutz , \" Lee Hardcastle 's claymation \" Toilet , \" about a boy who 's afraid to use the commode lest it devour him , is the most successful , tapping into subconscious fears with a sly sense of humor . Brit filmmaker Wheatley 's \" Unearthed , \" featuring a crazed mob chasing a vampire through the nighttime countryside from the undead 's point of view , begs for a longer treatment to play out the conflict between the victim and the aggressors . <p> Before ultimately closing with the wildly irreverent horror spoof \" Zetsumetsu \" from Japanese director Yoshihiro Nishimura , Xavier Gens ' French film \" XXL \" is as impressive for its social commentary as the blood-soaked special effects . An obese woman makes her way home as she 's publicly ridiculed by passersby at almost every turn . Arriving at her apartment , she immediately begins binging , indiscriminately consuming the contents of her copiously stocked refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her abundant flesh , she begins slicing away the fat even as she struggles to maintain consciousness with increasing blood loss . Shooting in a realistic , unflinching style , Gens capably portrays the woman 's desperation to adapt to a cultural norm with a sometimes unrealistic fixation on body image . <p> More erratic than consistently frightful , The ABCs of Death might have benefited from firmer curatorial guidance , but at least it 's laid the groundwork for developing a number of potentially effective feature-length films .

contribution to the upcoming s-vhs ) and cult favorite yoshihiro nishimura of tokyo gore police . <p> running times vary from just a few minutes to as many as six or seven , forcing the filmmakers to significantly compress their often gruesome narratives . both the originality and quality of the shorts are equally variable , with the majority coming off as mere genre exercises rather than fully conceived films . leading off with the first letter of the roman alphabet , nacho vigalondo 's \" apocalypse \" is n't nearly as ominous as the title suggests , focusing on a housewife who bloodily dispatches her bedridden husband after unsuccessfully poisoning him for months , impatient for him to meet his demise . <p> with the possible exception of \" dogfight , \" marcel sarmiento 's gritty take on a cage fighter who battles a vicious dog barehanded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iguchi , the series does n't really hit its stride until about halfway through , with tjahjanto 's \" libido . \" strapped down in heavy wooden chairs , two captive men are forced to pleasure themselves for a masked audience while watching various live sex acts , with the second-place finisher summarily and grotesquely executed . shot in an urgent , feverish style , the wan , desaturated color scheme sharply contrasts with the extremity of the men 's dire predicament . <p> \" nuptials \" from banjong pisanthanakun , the thai director of horror film shutter , injects some welcome humor into the grim proceedings . a young man presents his unimpressed girlfriend with a colorful parakeet as a gift , but when the bird voices her boyfriend 's wedding proposal and he proffers a ring , she interrupts her meal preparation to show her appreciation . the bird , however , has more to reveal , repeating a conversation that apparently took place between the man and his secret lover during a recent tryst , a disclosure that quickly enrages the knife-wielding girlfriend . pisanthanakun adopts a style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing contrast to the rapidly escalating onscreen violence . <p> among the animated shorts , which include the bizarre \" hydro-electric diffusion \" and the trifling \" klutz , \" lee hardcastle 's claymation \" toilet , \" about a boy who 's afraid to use the commode lest it devour him , is the most successful , tapping into subconscious fears with a sly sense of humor . brit filmmaker wheatley 's \" unearthed , \" featuring a crazed mob chasing a vampire through the nighttime countryside from the undead 's point of view , begs for a longer treatment to play out the conflict between the victim and the aggressors . <p> before ultimately closing with the wildly irreverent horror spoof \" zetsumetsu \" from japanese director yoshihiro nishimura , xavier gens ' french film \" xxl \" is as impressive for its social commentary as the blood-soaked special effects . an obese woman makes her way home as she 's publicly ridiculed by passersby at almost every turn . arriving at her apartment , she immediately begins binging , indiscriminately consuming the contents of her copiously stocked refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her abundant flesh , she begins slicing away the fat even as she struggles to maintain consciousness with increasing blood loss . shooting in a realistic , unflinching style , gens capably portrays the woman 's desperation to adapt to a cultural norm with a sometimes unrealistic fixation on body image . <p> more erratic than consistently frightful , the abcs of death might have benefited from firmer curatorial guidance , but at least it 's laid the groundwork for developing a number of potentially effective feature-length films .

        "title":"Inside the NBA's New Style Wars\n",
        "text":"<h> Inside the NBA 's New Style Wars <p> The rivalry among the NBA 's elite has spilled off the court and into an arena where athletes have historically feared to tread : high fashion . Players show up for games wearing leather pants , lensless glasses , and printed silk shirts -- and that 's just Russell Westbrook . GQ 's Steve Marsh spent a week trailing basketball 's biggest names -- Kevin Durant , Kobe , D-Wade , LeBron -- to find out how they 're turning the league into a runway for the world 's tallest peacocks <p> The moment Russell Westbrook steps off the bus in Denver for the Oklahoma City Thunder 's game against the Nuggets , you get the feeling that something insane is going to happen tonight . He 's wearing red leather motorcycle pants , a Superdry bomber jacket , black Doc Martens with the laces undone , and his trademark superfluous eyeglasses . A meager runway gallery awaits him -- just a few security guards , OKC 's team photographer , and me -- but he still disembarks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" pinstriped spinnaker on draft night \" to \" pure line cut slim enough to make Beckham look like a slob , \" Russ is a radical : His style is a punk provocation , a sartorial troll , and most crucially a full-on style , not just a series of outr ? outfits that no other player has the guts to wear . He 's swinging a leather Dopp kit with his right arm in a repetitive motion that could only be described as swag -- young , black , and Oi ! -- and generally looking like he 's striding out of Malcolm McLaren 's London SEX shop in 1976 . Every element of hiscostume is an extension of the identity he projects : part worldly NBA superstar , part suedehead hooligan . <p> A few hours later , in what NBA bloggers now refer to as \" the queso incident , \" Westbrook lives up to his look . It all starts during a time-out when Rocky the Mountain Lion , the Nuggets ' plushy yellow mascot , heaves up a perfect-looking half-court shot . If he makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of queso from Qdoba . But as the ball slo-mos toward the rim , Westbrook races over , leaps up , and pulls a supervillain move , intercepting it and inspiring the most scornful cascade of boos I 've ever heard . <p> Westbrook 's style-provocateur act has already become renowned in the NBA , because he stars on one of the league 's two best teams , appears regularly on nationally televised games -- where coverage of that short catwalk from the bus to the locker room is de rigueur -- and is expected to return to the NBA 's fashion week , the Finals , in June . But he is only one point of light in the league 's new style-savvy firmament , just one Instagram account in a sea of vanity-mirrored baller selfies . After all , the Thunder are merely watching the Heat 's ( bespoke-tailored ) throne . While Kobe Bryant can stand outside the Lakers locker room and proclaim to me , \" I 'm the Valentino of the NBA , \" as he explains that he 's leaving \" the preppy-hipster look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three -- LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , Chris Bosh -- can not relax . Not in a league where Amar'e Stoudemire can be found posting up in the front row of the Lanvin show at Paris fashion week , where Rajon Rondo 's retinue is trying to persuade Givenchy to pour a custom mold exclusively for his size 13 feet , where Steve Nash can pull the faux-disaffected Clooney , brushing off my questions about his style with an \" I do n't take it that seriously \" while going Gatsby ( that 's Kobe 's nickname for him ) in a suit from a Canadian made-to-order Internet clothier that he has a financial stake in . <p> A few days later , Westbrook 's publicist tells me that within certain rarefied fashion circles , RW is known as \" the Kate Moss of the NBA . \" Evidently somebody at Vogue wrote this to her in an e-mail . When I ask Russ how he feels about being compared to a female British supermodel famous for making heroin chic and saying things like \" Nothing tastes as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . \" It 's a little different , \" he says . \" But I think it got said because some people are not afraid to do certain things or wear certain stuff . You have to have a certain swagger about you . \" Even Westbrook has his limits , of course -- Kanye 's infamous leather kilt , for instance . Though in his next breath Russ allows that he 'd \" be open to it if it were a slimmer fit . \" <p> The NBA has had fashion moments before -- Clyde Frazier wearing his wide-brimmed Borsalino on the cover of Esquire , the introduction of the Air Jordan in the mid- ' 80s , Allen Iverson bringing cornrows , baggy jeans , and garish jewelry from the hood to the hardwood in the late ' 90s -- but the sine waves of high fashion and locker-room style have never synced up quite like they do right now . More than in any other sport , basketball showcases the individual ; we can see each player 's tics and idiosyncrasies when he 's on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we think he is . And at least as far back as Frazier , no sport has been more enmeshed in the allure of black culture and style . But recently , whether it 's sparked by the explosion of social media or the imposition of David Stern 's corporate-friendly dress code , or whether it 's just the logical outcome of the ongoing gene splice of NBA superstars to multinational apparel companies , the players are more self-aware than ever , more cognizant that personal style is a prerequisite for personal brand . Whether they actually love fashion or not , they understand the need to be perceived as style leaders , at least of some kind , in order to maximize their shoe-company contracts . <p> Consider the OKC Thunder . When they 're in uniform , Westbrook and his All-NBA teammate , forward Kevin Durant , are the league 's youngest , most exciting Batman-and-Robin act ; in street clothes -- the term feels nearly archaic -- they are two opposite fronts in the NBA 's escalating style wars . If Westbrook is the NBA 's Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middleton -- aristocratic and punctilious . Whereas Westbrook invites regular hazing from Charles Barkley and three-quarters of Twitter for dressing like a badass Ziggy Stardust in glammy Neil Barrett silver-leather shirts and Givenchy hoodies , Durant keeps it on the Take Ivy tip , seldom venturing far from the prepped-up hipster look favored around the league of late , pairing his Air Jordans or AF1s with various combos of custom-tailored cardigan , collared shirt , and corduroys . He 's running for president , not leading an insurgency . <p> Compared to the NBA 's established style kings , Durant is still on the climb , newly intrigued , still searching for his look . \" I always wanted to be fly , \" he tells me outside a Barneys in Santa Monica , where he ca n't find one piece of off-the-rack clothing to fit his super-elongated limbs . \" I always put stuff together , \" he says . \" But it was hard for me to find clothes , since I was so tall , my feet were so big , my arms were so long . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest barrier : Not one designer in the industry -- not one -- is thinking six feet nine , 235 , with a plus wingspan when determining next season 's look . Another is functionality : NBA players sweat for a living . They 're most comfortable in workout clothes , because that 's where they live . Until last season , Durant was that guy . Then he was approached after a game by Regi Puckett , an enterprising stylist in Chicago , who told him he could push his look beyond the schoolboy **30;54;TOOLONG gimmick he made famous during the previous year 's playoffs . Now Durant can screen-grab a picture of a peacoat or a pair of slacks that he sees in a magazine or a blog and send it to Puckett , who will get the piece constructed to Durantula proportions . <p> Westbrook , on the other hand , is normal-human-sized ( he 's six feet three ) and can buy straight off the rack . He 's loved shopping since his mother brought him to downtown L.A. 's fashion alley as a little kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after working out , I 'll find some shops and go check it out and see if they have some new stuff . See what 's good . I go to Barneys ; I go to Gucci , Louis , YSL . I go everywhere -- Rodeo Drive , Vivienne Westwood , Marc Jacobs , Joyrich . I 'm all around . \" <p> He 's found friends within the haute couture scene , tagging along with Vogue 's Andr ? Leon Talley during New York 's Fashion Week last fall . \" ALT 's not really into sports , \" he says , \" but we were able to conversate about the history of fashion , and I was able to get his perspective on the shows and how the fabrics and the clothes fit on the different girls and guys . \" Westbrook is especially proud that , unlike his peers around the league , he 's never hired a stylist . So proud , in fact , that he 's hired a publicist to trumpet the fact that he 's never hired a stylist . \" I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know people that can get me clothes , \" he says . \" But it 's not like I have somebody that comes to pick out my outfits . \" <p> The surest sign that Westbrook has crossed over as a style icon is the venom he inspires . When I ask Puckett who the most stylish man in the NBA is , he insinuates that it 's Kevin and takes a playful jab at Russ in the process . \" I 'll say he shares a locker room with the guy that has the most people talking about what he 's wearing . \" <p> Durant immediately defuses style-rivalry talk . \" When I look in the mirror and I feel good about myself , that 's the only person I 'm trying to impress . \" Later , when I talk to Westbrook , he does n't rise to the bait , either , but it 's clear where he rates in his own mind . I tell him Durant admitted to me that he tunes up his look when he 's in a big city like Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hometown ? <p> \" Nah , \" he says , dismissively . \" I dress up everywhere . \" <p> Time-wave zero for the modern era of NBA style is 2005 , when the league adopted its new dress code . Vague enough in its language -- dress slacks or dress jeans , dress shoes or dress boots ; collared shirt on the way into the locker room ; no chains , pendants , or medallions worn over clothes ; no hats , etc. -- it was strictly enforced upon introduction . You may recall some controversy . There were cries of racism , complaints that the league was cracking down on hip-hop fashions in deference to squirrelly corporate sponsors . The architect of the code , NBA commissioner David Stern , has always dismissed that idea . \" Our guys were photographed coming into buildings looking like they were going to a day at the beach , \" he explained to me . <p> What no one disputes , Stern included , is that a cottage industry bloomed in the code 's wake . At this moment in 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a six-foot-seven bespoke tailor with a showroom in downtown Los Angeles ( his clients for suits and separates include Blake Griffin , Chris Bosh , Amar'e Stoudemire , and Tyson Chandler ) , to Laure Heriard Dubreuil , a well-connected French owner of a 20,000-square-foot multi-luxury-brand boutique in Miami Beach called The Webster , to the woman who has elevated the league 's sartorial game higher than anybody else , the Harlem-based stylist Rachel Johnson , a former Essenceassistant who went on to do video shoots for Jay-Z and N.E.R.D. before landing big-name NBA clients like LeBron James . <p> This network cajoles American and European designers into expanding the top end of their size runs -- Dubreuil has successfully lobbied Givenchy to offer menswear sizes up to 62 -- and ensures that the players get dibs on items from seasonal lines . ( Just before New York 's spring Fashion Week , I accompanied Johnson on a mission to Calvin Klein 's midtown showroom to pull olood blazers for Stoudemire ; STAT 's measurements are then sent to Milan , where the jackets are sewn to his size ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an NBA player can help \" masculinize \" their clothes . \" Anybody with any insight understands a &amp;#x2018 ; real guy ' looks to an athlete before he looks to a waify model , \" she says , \" or even an actor . \" <p> Stern freely admits he never saw this coming , and then goes on to imply that he kinda saw this coming . Right after the code was instituted , \" a lot of players would whisper to me , I do n't know what the fuss is about . Let 's go ! There was a sense that this allowed players to express their sense of style . Our players , individually , took it as a catalyst to show themselves off . And suddenly the response from the public was so overwhelmingly positive that , you know , it 's getting to be like the red carpet at the Grammys . Who 's dressing you tonight ? Armani . Now they are among the best-looking , best-shaped models in the world . \" <p> When I first hook up with the Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oracle in Oakland , where they 've just knocked off the Golden State Warriors . LeBron scored the 20,000th point of his career tonight , making him the youngest ever to reach this milestone , and the media scrum around his locker has hardened into a callus . Across the room from Bron , Chris Bosh is in one corner , already dressed in a light fern , unbelievably slim custom Waraire Boswell suit and a \" CB \" tie bar , with a hardcover of Laura Hillenbrand 's Unbroken visible from his unzipped black Parabellum bag . Dwyane Wade is pulling on a pair of electric-blue Scotch &amp; Soda trousers , which he hikes up to showcase his multicolored hosiery as he hollers , \" You need to raise your sock game , \" in Ray Allen 's direction . <p> This kind of style smack is constant in the Miami locker room , says veteran swingman Shane Battier -- so constant that \" it 's when they stop talking about you that you know you 're in trouble . \" Battier , who limits his own aspirations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with jeans ) , says that the pressure on Miami 's Big Three to dress well every day can be too much for even the most tasteful global icon . \" LeBron falters occasionally , \" Battier declares . \" And when he does , we let him know about it . \" <p> Bosh , who also works with Rachel Johnson , tells me that while he and Bron \" like to be stylish and comfortable , \" he thinks Wade is more willing to suffer for fashion . Wade agrees . \" I take more risks , knowing there are going to be jokes , \" he says . \" Chris does n't take many risks -- he dresses very nice , but he keeps it simple . \" <p> Perhaps Wade 's most famous risk to date is the pink-chocolate-yellow patent leather Louboutins he wore to the White House on January 28 for the Heat 's traditional **26;86;TOOLONG photo op with President Obama . Wade admits he was nervous about wearing the sneakers on such an official state visit and had to be nudged by his stylist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's former assistant ) . <p> \" I 'm always more nervous than her , because I 'm the one who has to put this stuff on , \" he says . \" This is my second time going to the White House as a champion . This time I decided on the gray suit . I knew everybody was going to go with something dark , so I wanted to do something different . And I had the gray-white-and-black shoes out that went with the suit , and then there was the pink pair . So we sat and thought about it : &amp;#x2018 ; Okay , I can go with the gray-white-and-black ones , but that 's typical , and I do n't do typical all the time , so let 's do something a little different . ' And it worked ! \" <p> At the ceremony in the East Room -- and apologies in advance for the logrolling , especially since **32;114;TOOLONG logrolling is the worst kind , but I have to do it , if only for the benefit of the archivists -- Obama said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soul of this team , continue to do whatever it takes to win , including leading the team in blocks , and at the postgame press conferences he dressed well enough to land himself in GQ magazine . \" The president then turned away from the podium and , in a scene reminiscent of Lyndon Johnson 's CGI 'd bemusement with Forrest Gump 's bare ass , called out , \" Show ' em your kicks here , Dwyane . \" Satisfied , Obama turned back to the crowd . \" If any of you can pull this off other than Dwyane Wade , let me know . \" <p> \" Fashion is fun to me , \" Wade tells me later . \" I feel like the way that I dress says a lot about my personality . A lot of people will not get a chance to talk to me , but when they look at me , they can get an idea of who Dwyane Wade is . \" <p> While the Heat are in D.C. hanging with the president , I pay a visit to Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration board . \" On the wall behind her desk is a black pinboard with a collage of looks from fashion magazines cut and pasted underneath each one of her famous clients . It all feels so imperial -- courtiers of the court ! Can you imagine Magic or Larry ever having an inspiration board ? But Johnson has a specific trajectory in mind for LeBron and Bosh for the second half of the season . She wants to continue putting distance between them and the preppy look that David Stern affectionately refers to as \" nerdwear . \" Wade and Barnett , meanwhile , have their own plan for the spring : draining the color from Wade 's look and focusing on texture and silhouette , partly to showcase Wade 's \" maturity \" and partly as a cross-promotion for the Chinese shoe company Wade promotes , Li-Ning , whose spring line is the Black Collection . <p> When I reconnect with the Heat in Brooklyn two nights after their White House trip , it 's the team 's first-ever visit to the Barclays Center , two weeks before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaver-fur bomber hat -- his teammates are calling him \" the Black Russian \" -- and a dark green motorcycle jacket by the young British designer Adrien Sauvage . Wade is not quite in Westbrook territory -- he loves clothes but hates to shop . \" My stylist has done an unbelievable job of opening my mind , \" he says . \" Without her I would be behind the curve . She helps me be in the now and in the future . \" <p> After the game , a blowout win for the Heat , the visitors locker room is predictably jam-packed . There 's a GQ photographer in here , and plans for a show-offy shot are being hatched , but D-Wade has to shout across the locker room at LeBron to be heard over this din : \" HEY , WE GON NA DO THIS PICTURE ? \" LeBron looks confused amid all the commotion . He shouts back , \" I DU N NO . YOU GON NA DO IT ? \" <p> They decide to do something unusual : They walk out together , sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one he wore coming into the arena . It 's dressier . This time it 's an A.P.C . peacoat over a crisp white shirt and tie . He has a black watchman 's cap tilted on his head . Wade is still rocking the Black Russian . <p> The two of them are flanked by security guards who are mean-mugging through the phalanx of lingerers in the Barclays loading dock . LeBron and Wade get caught in an eddy against a wall , where they smile and say hello to a pair of female fans . The photographer is told to stop shooting , because nobody wants this to look weird . But we 're running out of catwalk .

        "lower_text":"<h> inside the nba 's new style wars <p> the rivalry among the nba 's elite has spilled off the court and into an arena where athletes have historically feared to tread : high fashion . players show up for games wearing leather pants , lensless glasses , and printed silk shirts -- and that 's just russell westbrook . gq 's steve marsh spent a week trailing basketball 's biggest names -- kevin durant , kobe , d-wade , lebron -- to find out how they 're turning the league into a runway for the world 's tallest peacocks <p> the moment russell westbrook steps off the bus in denver for the oklahoma city thunder 's game against the nuggets , you get the feeling that something insane is going to happen tonight . he 's wearing red leather motorcycle pants , a superdry bomber jacket , black doc martens with the laces undone , and his trademark superfluous eyeglasses . a meager runway gallery awaits him -- just a few security guards , okc 's team photographer , and me -- but he still disembarks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" pinstriped spinnaker on draft night \" to \" pure line cut slim enough to make beckham look like a slob , \" russ is a radical : his style is a punk provocation , a sartorial troll , and most crucially a full-on style , not just a series of outr ? outfits that no other player has the guts to wear . he 's swinging a leather dopp kit with his right arm in a repetitive motion that could only be described as swag -- young , black , and oi ! -- and generally looking like he 's striding out of malcolm mclaren 's london sex shop in 1976 . every element of hiscostume is an extension of the identity he projects : part worldly nba superstar , part suedehead hooligan . <p> a few hours later , in what nba bloggers now refer to as \" the queso incident , \" westbrook lives up to his look . it all starts during a time-out when rocky the mountain lion , the nuggets ' plushy yellow mascot , heaves up a perfect-looking half-court shot . if he makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of queso from qdoba . but as the ball slo-mos toward the rim , westbrook races over , leaps up , and pulls a supervillain move , intercepting it and inspiring the most scornful cascade of boos i 've ever heard . <p> westbrook 's style-provocateur act has already become renowned in the nba , because he stars on one of the league 's two best teams , appears regularly on nationally televised games -- where coverage of that short catwalk from the bus to the locker room is de rigueur -- and is expected to return to the nba 's fashion week , the finals , in june . but he is only one point of light in the league 's new style-savvy firmament , just one instagram account in a sea of vanity-mirrored baller selfies . after all , the thunder are merely watching the heat 's ( bespoke-tailored ) throne . while kobe bryant can stand outside the lakers locker room and proclaim to me , \" i 'm the valentino of the nba , \" as he explains that he 's leaving \" the preppy-hipster look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three -- lebron james , dwyane wade , chris bosh -- can not relax . not in a league where amar'e stoudemire can be found posting up in the front row of the lanvin show at paris fashion week , where rajon rondo 's retinue is trying to persuade givenchy to pour a custom mold exclusively for his size 13 feet , where steve nash can pull the faux-disaffected clooney , brushing off my questions about his style with an \" i do n't take it that seriously \" while going gatsby ( that 's kobe 's nickname for him ) in a suit from a canadian made-to-order internet clothier that he has a financial stake in . <p> a few days later , westbrook 's publicist tells me that within certain rarefied fashion circles , rw is known as \" the kate moss of the nba . \" evidently somebody at vogue wrote this to her in an e-mail . when i ask russ how he feels about being compared to a female british supermodel famous for making heroin chic and saying things like \" nothing tastes as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . \" it 's a little different , \" he says . \" but i think it got said because some people are not afraid to do certain things or wear certain stuff . you have to have a certain swagger about you . \" even westbrook has his limits , of course -- kanye 's infamous leather kilt , for instance . though in his next breath russ allows that he 'd \" be open to it if it were a slimmer fit . \" <p> the nba has had fashion moments before -- clyde frazier wearing his wide-brimmed borsalino on the cover of esquire , the introduction of the air jordan in the mid- ' 80s , allen iverson bringing cornrows , baggy jeans , and garish jewelry from the hood to the hardwood in the late ' 90s -- but the sine waves of high fashion and locker-room style have never synced up quite like they do right now . more than in any other sport , basketball showcases the individual ; we can see each player 's tics and idiosyncrasies when he 's on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we think he is . and at least as far back as frazier , no sport has been more enmeshed in the allure of black culture and style . but recently , whether it 's sparked by the explosion of social media or the imposition of david stern 's corporate-friendly dress code , or whether it 's just the logical outcome of the ongoing gene splice of nba superstars to multinational apparel companies , the players are more self-aware than ever , more cognizant that personal style is a prerequisite for personal brand . whether they actually love fashion or not , they understand the need to be perceived as style leaders , at least of some kind , in order to maximize their shoe-company contracts . <p> consider the okc thunder . when they 're in uniform , westbrook and his all-nba teammate , forward kevin durant , are the league 's youngest , most exciting batman-and-robin act ; in street clothes -- the term feels nearly archaic -- they are two opposite fronts in the nba 's escalating style wars . if westbrook is the nba 's kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middleton -- aristocratic and punctilious . whereas westbrook invites regular hazing from charles barkley and three-quarters of twitter for dressing like a badass ziggy stardust in glammy neil barrett silver-leather shirts and givenchy hoodies , durant keeps it on the take ivy tip , seldom venturing far from the prepped-up hipster look favored around the league of late , pairing his air jordans or af1s with various combos of custom-tailored cardigan , collared shirt , and corduroys . he 's running for president , not leading an insurgency . <p> compared to the nba 's established style kings , durant is still on the climb , newly intrigued , still searching for his look . \" i always wanted to be fly , \" he tells me outside a barneys in santa monica , where he ca n't find one piece of off-the-rack clothing to fit his super-elongated limbs . \" i always put stuff together , \" he says . \" but it was hard for me to find clothes , since i was so tall , my feet were so big , my arms were so long . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest barrier : not one designer in the industry -- not one -- is thinking six feet nine , 235 , with a plus wingspan when determining next season 's look . another is functionality : nba players sweat for a living . they 're most comfortable in workout clothes , because that 's where they live . until last season , durant was that guy . then he was approached after a game by regi puckett , an enterprising stylist in chicago , who told him he could push his look beyond the schoolboy **30;54;toolong gimmick he made famous during the previous year 's playoffs . now durant can screen-grab a picture of a peacoat or a pair of slacks that he sees in a magazine or a blog and send it to puckett , who will get the piece constructed to durantula proportions . <p> westbrook , on the other hand , is normal-human-sized ( he 's six feet three ) and can buy straight off the rack . he 's loved shopping since his mother brought him to downtown l.a. 's fashion alley as a little kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after working out , i 'll find some shops and go check it out and see if they have some new stuff . see what 's good . i go to barneys ; i go to gucci , louis , ysl . i go everywhere -- rodeo drive , vivienne westwood , marc jacobs , joyrich . i 'm all around . \" <p> he 's found friends within the haute couture scene , tagging along with vogue 's andr ? leon talley during new york 's fashion week last fall . \" alt 's not really into sports , \" he says , \" but we were able to conversate about the history of fashion , and i was able to get his perspective on the shows and how the fabrics and the clothes fit on the different girls and guys . \" westbrook is especially proud that , unlike his peers around the league , he 's never hired a stylist . so proud , in fact , that he 's hired a publicist to trumpet the fact that he 's never hired a stylist . \" i know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i know people that can get me clothes , \" he says . \" but it 's not like i have somebody that comes to pick out my outfits . \" <p> the surest sign that westbrook has crossed over as a style icon is the venom he inspires . when i ask puckett who the most stylish man in the nba is , he insinuates that it 's kevin and takes a playful jab at russ in the process . \" i 'll say he shares a locker room with the guy that has the most people talking about what he 's wearing . \" <p> durant immediately defuses style-rivalry talk . \" when i look in the mirror and i feel good about myself , that 's the only person i 'm trying to impress . \" later , when i talk to westbrook , he does n't rise to the bait , either , but it 's clear where he rates in his own mind . i tell him durant admitted to me that he tunes up his look when he 's in a big city like los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hometown ? <p> \" nah , \" he says , dismissively . \" i dress up everywhere . \" <p> time-wave zero for the modern era of nba style is 2005 , when the league adopted its new dress code . vague enough in its language -- dress slacks or dress jeans , dress shoes or dress boots ; collared shirt on the way into the locker room ; no chains , pendants , or medallions worn over clothes ; no hats , etc. -- it was strictly enforced upon introduction . you may recall some controversy . there were cries of racism , complaints that the league was cracking down on hip-hop fashions in deference to squirrelly corporate sponsors . the architect of the code , nba commissioner david stern , has always dismissed that idea . \" our guys were photographed coming into buildings looking like they were going to a day at the beach , \" he explained to me . <p> what no one disputes , stern included , is that a cottage industry bloomed in the code 's wake . at this moment in 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a six-foot-seven bespoke tailor with a showroom in downtown los angeles ( his clients for suits and separates include blake griffin , chris bosh , amar'e stoudemire , and tyson chandler ) , to laure heriard dubreuil , a well-connected french owner of a 20,000-square-foot multi-luxury-brand boutique in miami beach called the webster , to the woman who has elevated the league 's sartorial game higher than anybody else , the harlem-based stylist rachel johnson , a former essenceassistant who went on to do video shoots for jay-z and n.e.r.d. before landing big-name nba clients like lebron james . <p> this network cajoles american and european designers into expanding the top end of their size runs -- dubreuil has successfully lobbied givenchy to offer menswear sizes up to 62 -- and ensures that the players get dibs on items from seasonal lines .

        "text":"<h> The Good Listener : The Power Of Pulling The Plug <p> Bon Iver 's Justin Vernon in 2009 , after the release of his mostly acoustic debut album , but before the group 's second album , which includes the ' 80s-inspired saxophone jam \" Beth\/Rest . \" ( Yes , we noticed that his guitar is plugged in . ) Shawn Brackbill\/Corbis hide caption <p> toggle caption Shawn Brackbill\/Corbis <p> Bon Iver 's Justin Vernon in 2009 , after the release of his mostly acoustic debut album , but before the group 's second album , which includes the ' 80s-inspired saxophone jam \" Beth\/Rest . \" ( Yes , we noticed that his guitar is plugged in . ) <p> Shawn Brackbill\/Corbis <p> We get a lot of mail at NPR Music , and amid the Penzey 's spice catalogs we will never open is a slew of smart questions about how music fits into our lives -- and , this week , why \" unplugged \" versions of songs are so often preferable to their more fussed-over studio counterparts . <p> Phil Kingston writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-released acoustic version of the Steve McQueen album , and it sounds better than the original . Which prompts the question : Why do unplugged recordings work ? Did the first production choices not get it right ? Why does stripping down a song make it feel more authentic , deeper , etc. ? \" <p> For starters , you use an important word in your question : \" authentic . \" As music listeners , we 've all got a few cynical synapses that fire when we sense we 're being tricked -- think , especially recently , of the goosing of vocals via Auto-Tune . No matter how much we know about the process by which a record was made , it 's easy to shrug off a song 's sound when we can hear the sweeteners and the heavy hands of studio Frankensteins well-versed in turning marginal talents into slick superstars . <p> When Adele strolled in to the NPR Music offices a few years ago to perform a three-song Tiny Desk Concert on the eve of 21 's release , her band did n't exactly play \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice rang out without amplification . No filters , no microphone , no AutoTune , no way to mistake her for anything but the powerhouse captured on her records . Every inflection , every emotion rang out without assistance ; everyone I talked to afterward was like , \" No Auto-Tune there ! \" <p> Credit : NPR <p> Truly \" unplugged , \" unamplified performances serve the same purpose . They strip away what we see as smoke and mirrors to reveal a lot of essences -- the essence of a voice , the essence of a melody , the essence of a song 's sturdiness and versatility -- while also applying a veneer of timelessness . <p> Production techniques come and go , from the electric pianos and saxophones of so much ' 80s music to the overtly employed sweeteners that have turned up in a lot of pop music in the past decade . Love those techniques or hate them , they tend to cement a song 's place in a very specific era of popular music -- which is why , when Bon Iver dressed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 80s signifiers , so many fans recoiled . Our brains move on from outdated sounds in ways that make them seem jarring when we revisit records years and especially decades later . <p> YouTube <p> When bands unplug -- particularly when everything is boiled down to a voice and a guitar -- those performances are rendered largely immune to obsolescence . Johnny Cash 's voice-and-guitar masterpiece American Recordings followed a fallow period in which Cash released a string of sterile studio recordings , but when that first Rick Rubin-produced album came out in 1994 , it could have come from virtually any era . Cash 's weather-beaten voice obviously boomed out of a specific time in his life , and many of the songs were of recent vintage , but nothing else on American Recordings was tethered to any era . <p> YouTube <p> In music , as in many fields that lean on technology , today 's multidimensional state of the art is tomorrow 's tinny kitsch .

        "text":"<p> Why do we imprison people who are addicted to illegal drugs instead of treating them for their addiction ? That question is at the heart of David Sheff 's new book Clean : Overcoming Addiction and Ending America 's Greatest Tragedy . It reports the latest medical and scientific research about addiction and recovery , which , Sheff says , shows that drug addicts are gravely ill , afflicted with a chronic , progressive and often terminal disease . <p> Sheff 's research is motivated by having watched his son Nic 's addiction nearly destroy him and the family . Nic started smoking marijuana when he was 12 and eventually moved on to shooting heroin and crystal meth . He became homeless , living on the streets , in cars , in parks , and when he did come home , he stole from and lied to the family . Sheff wrote about how the family lived through his son 's addiction in the best-selling memoir Beautiful Boy . Nic wrote about his addiction in two memoirs and has been clean for five years . <p> David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family 's experience and why he feels the nation 's approach to drug treatment failed his son . <h> Interview Highlights <p> On the first time his son got high <p> \" Nic describes the first time he used in high school as transformative . It was n't so much about being high -- it was about feeling OK for the first time in his life . He said that he did n't know it was possible to feel an absence of the intense anxiety that he felt , the intense depression . So when he got high , it was just life-changing . \" <p> Addiction is a disease like anything else . It 's like cancer , like heart disease , like diabetes . And we know that at the first signs of serious illness , we want to seek treatment . <p> On why we should n't wait for a person to hit rock bottom before getting them help <p> \" I 've heard over and over again , we 're told that they had to let their kids , you know , their husbands , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , not to intervene , let them hit bottom so they would crawl into a treatment and say , ' Please help me . ' That idea , it is so dangerous . It has killed so many people . The other problem with it is that this is a progressive disease , which means that as long as it 's not being treated , it gets worse . So the longer we stand back and allow this to happen and allow the drug use to continue and allow the behavior that is caused by the drug use to worsen so that someone is going to use more drugs and it 's just a cycle , the harder it is to treat them . So addiction is a disease like anything else . It 's like cancer , like heart disease , like diabetes . And we know that at the first signs of serious illness , we want to seek treatment . If someone in our families had early warning signs of any of those diseases , we would bring them to a doctor to figure out what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressed . \" <p> David Sheff is the author of the best-selling memoir Beautiful Boy.His other books include Game Over , China Dawn and All We Are Saying .

' So this was the first time I did n't have to say a word . He got on the phone , he called the Hazelden treatment center in Minnesota . He was on a plane that day . To me , it 's possible to look back on that and say all the treatments before that were a failure : Here he was sober for such a long time , and he relapsed again . But for me , it 's the opposite : It shows that the treatments had helped him so much that he was able to recognize that he was in a free fall . \" <p> On one of the problems he has with the 12-step program <p> \" The 12 steps are a completely profound treatment for so many people , but not most people , and that 's the problem that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

You get people in treatment -- especially teenagers -- I mean , what is it to be a teenager ? It is to feel , you know , this powerfulness , and part of the 12 steps is that you have to admit that you are powerless over your addiction .

So , in addition to the writing and targeting advice we 've offered in our articles , we 'll be sharing tips on Web design , how to establish an online presence , how to best utilize social media , and more . To get the ball rolling , we 're starting with one of the most important features of an author website -- one you 'll need to quickly grow repeat visitors . Keep reading to learn how to implement a strong call to action on your author website and build your author platform . <p> Call To Action : What It Is And How To Use It <p> A call to action is a clear statement , instructing your visitors what to do or how to reach a goal , whether it be trivial or important . With a strong call to action , you tell your visitors , \" Do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as subtly as the wording of a menu option . <p> A subtle call to action would be to label your published works page , \" Read My Published Work , \" instead of \" Published Work . \" The former is a call to action , and the latter is neutral information . <p> An overt call to action would be , \" Enter the contest here ! \" and \" Join the mailing list to receive weekly tips , \" which say openly to the visitor , \" You should do this . \" By writing , \" You can enter the contest here , \" you imply , \" if you feel like it , \" which wo n't give your visitors the same psychological push to follow through . <p> 3 Ways Writers Can Use Calls To Action <p> As a writer , you need a call to action on your author website to attract repeat visitors and promote your online platform . And while you might not have any books for sale , and you might not have a mailing list yet , the following calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his or her website . <p> Note : You do n't want to overwhelm visitors with too many calls to action right on the homepage . Based on your biggest priority , choose one of the following items for your homepage 's main call to action . <p> Social media pages . It 's important for any writer to promote himself or herself on social media . And while different social media pages lend themselves to writing more than others ( Twitter and Facebook are very text-based while Pinterest is better suited for images ) , you should invest ample time in building your presence on multiple social media forms . If that 's your strength , you should direct your visitors to your well-followed Twitter feed or your haiku-a-day Facebook fan page . <p> Mailing lists . One of the best ways to build your repeat audience is to create a mailing list . A first-time visitor is more likely to come back to your website or social media pages if he\/she is actively receiving new e-mails in his\/her inbox from you , directing him\/her to \" Click here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to action to sign up for your mailing list , first-time visitors probably wo n't be inclined to fill out the sign-up form -- or , worse , they wo n't even realize that you have a mailing list because it was n't clearly stated on the most heavily trafficked pages of your website . <p> Selling books or other products or services . If you 've self-published or traditionally published any books , chapbooks , e-books , etc. , or offer services like ghostwriting or proofreading , it 's important to funnel your visitors toward those items you have for sale . If they 're not interested in purchasing anything , they can still browse the rest of the site , and you 've eliminated the chance that a happy visitor clicked out of the site before realizing that he\/she could purchase your written work or services . <p> By using calls to action in a purposeful way , you 'll greatly increase your repeat visitors and active participators . And remember : You do n't need to be heavy-handed with your calls to action . There are very subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . By giving one direct instruction instead of multiple options or wishy-washy offers , you can better build your online platform . ",

That 's because her fourth album , \" Side Effects of You \" ( 19 Recordings\/RCA ) , debuted at No. 1 on Billboard 's Top R&amp;B\/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 2 on the Billboard 200 . <p> The debut positions of Fantasia 's latest album resemble the performance of 2010 's \" Back to Me , \" which has sold 490,000 copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan . Adding in 2006 's \" Fantasia \" and 2004 's \" Free Yourself , \" the Grammy Award winner accounts for 2.9 million albums sold and is the fifth-largest-selling \" Idol \" contestant behind Carrie Underwood ( 14.2 million ) , Kelly Clarkson ( 12.3 million ) , Chris Daughtry ( 6.8 million ) and Clay Aiken ( 5.1 million ) . Fantasia is also the biggest seller among \" Idol \" R&amp;B acts . <p> So what triggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fantasia 's resonating performance of lead single \" Lose to Win \" during her April 18 return to the \" Idol \" stage . Currently No. 4 on the Adult R&amp;B chart , the track 's resulting digital sales spike gave her an eighth top 10-a tally that includes 13-week No. 1 \" Truth Is . \" Fantasia also counts four top 10s on Hot R&amp;B\/Hip-Hop Songs , including the No. 1 \" When I See You . \" <p> Fantasia 's vision also included working primarily with one producer-Harmony Samuels ( Kelly Rowland , Chris Brown ) -and penning a majority of the tracks with a team of writers ranging from Andrea Martin and Emeli Sand ? to Missy Elliott and Courtney Harrell . The title track was produced by Naughty Boy . <p> Paired with Samuels by RCA executive VP\/head of A&amp;R Keith Naftaly , Fantasia says she knew by the second day in the studio there was a special connection . \" I 'd been writing down a lot of thoughts and feelings during my time away , \" she recalls . \" So I wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything back . He picked up on that . It was n't just about producing an album to make money . He genuinely wanted to see me deliver and be able to perform in a different mind-set . \" <p> Guest features are limited to Big K.R.I.T. on the engaging \" Supernatural Love \" and Rowland and Elliott on the colorful declaration \" Without Me . \" Tagged as the second single , the latter recently went for adds at mainstream R&amp;B radio . <p> It 's the latest step in a marketing campaign designed to bring Fantasia before a wider audience . In addition to \" Idol , \" RCA senior VP of marketing Carolyn Williams and VP of publicity Theola Borden point to appearances on the highly rated cable concert special \" Centric Live : Fantasia at the Fillmore \" ( April 20 ) , \" Good Morning America \" ( April 24 ) , Bravo 's \" Watch What Happens Live ! \" and CNN 's \" Showbiz Tonight \" ( both April 25 ) and \" The View \" ( April 29 ) as major components in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next phase will target late-night TV , a tour and additional fashion spreads ( Fantasia earlier appeared on the cover of Upscale magazine ) , focusing on the singer 's more colorful and sophisticated imaging . \" This Fantasia wants to step out now , \" the singer says with a laugh . \" It took a while for me to get there -- I had insecurities . But I 'm more confident and comfortable with the woman I 've become . \" <p> She will be drawing on that hard-won confidence when she hits the stage with an unlikely partner in June : Andrea Bocelli . During five select dates on ?

And fund companies are doing a lot . <p> The problem seems simple , and in some ways , like it should already have been solved . Given the advent of IRS-sanctioned tax-deferred savings plans like IRAs and 401(k)s , the opportunity for automatic enrollment in these plans , the elimination of most company-sponsored defined benefit plans and the threat to Social Security , who would n't want to do all they can to make sure they are prepared for their retirement ? <p> Yet fund company CEOs say that increasing the number of people directing a percentage of their paycheck to retirement funds and figuring out how to persuade employees that increasing the amount they divert to their retirement plans each year will pay off in the long run remains a huge industry challenge . <p> Many are failing to do that . According to commentary from an oft-quoted Merrill Lynch Help2Retire webcast , half of eligible employees younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 401(k) programs .

And everybody says , ' Yes . ' What if I could guarantee you a 200 percent return , would you take it ? Everybody says , ' Yes . ' But what the statistics show is that over 40 percent of people do n't take advantage of their employer match .

A petition with 3,700 names was signed in support of the standards , and Kentucky education officials include several scientific organizations that have shown their support . At the same time , the state received over one-hundred identical emails that opposed inclusion of evolution and characterized it as a theory and not a fact . <p> A Statement of Consideration is what the board approved on Thursday . It 's the formal document that includes recommendations for any changes to the standards based off public comments . <p> The regulation now heads to Kentucky 's Administrative Regulation Review Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new standards would go into effect during the 2014-2015 school year . <p> Updating science standards is part of Kentucky 's education reforms . <p> The Next Generation Science Standards were developed by 26 states , including Kentucky .

        "text":"<h> Latest Trends in Intelligent Robot End-of-Arm Tooling <p> The role of robot end-of-arm tooling has never been more important . With robot users demanding more versatility in their processes , manufacturers are under pressure to deliver flexible , intelligent end-of-arm tooling ( EOAT ) that adds value to the overall system . From servo grippers and hybrid tooling , to advanced tool changers and control modules , today 's EOAT is not only easier to implement and easier to use , it 's down right smart . <p> Application-specific grippers are bringing robotics within arm 's length of a broader audience , to new industries and small to midsized businesses that would have considered it out of reach just a year ago . A new breed of anthropomorphic end effector not only plays nice in the lab , it 's finding its way onto the shop floor . And a magnetic gripper that 's the polar opposite of anything on the market is attracting fans . <p> Pick and place , weld , deburr , apply material , inspect and locate , load\/unload -- and do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gauntlet , and manufacturers are raising their \" hands \" to the challenge . <p> Flexible , Intelligent EOAT With a glut of homogenous grippers on the market , leading manufacturers are working to differentiate themselves from the commodity-laden torrent . End-of-arm tooling manufacturers are asking themselves how they can add more value to their EOAT . <p> \" The way we 're adding value is with smarter and more flexible end effectors , EOAT that actually acts with intelligence rather than placing the burden on the robot itself , \" says Henry Loos , Application Engineer at Applied Robotics Inc. in Glenville , New York . As a result , we 're starting to see lines of demarcation among different manufacturers , and customers are shopping around more . \" <p> \" By moving intelligence out to the end-of-arm tooling and allowing the end effector to make some positioning decisions on its own , independent of the robot , we wind up with a system that the robot programmer can then program more quickly and easily , \" says Loos . \" People are pumping out applications much quicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upfront for this intelligent end-of-arm tooling , you 'll save tons in expensive programming labor , \" he says . \" And when you need to make a quick change to the system , the faster your EOAT allows you to make that change , the less downtime you will have and the less you will be paying your process engineers to re-process the station . \" <p> Servo Grippers Flexibility is one of the biggest differentiators and the common denominator in the latest EOAT trends . Robot users are asking for end-of-arm tooling that can handle multiple sizes of similar materials , or end effectors to handle different kinds of materials , or hybrid technologies that tackle multiple tasks with the same EOAT . <p> \" Our customers want to utilize the same tool for various sized bags without having to use some kind of manual width adjustment , \" says John Westbeld , Engineering Manager at SAS Automation LLC in Xenia , Ohio . \" Our new Servo Bag Gripper SBG50 incorporates a servomotor with a belt and pulley system to automatically adjust on-the-fly between different bag widths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate one robot on two lines with different sized bags . It will adjust the width on-the-fly from one side to the other as you palletize two different lines at the same time , with one robot and one EOAT . \" <p> This video shows the servo bag gripper in action handling different sized bags . <p> Westbeld says that the robot must be preconfigured with a 7th axis controller in order to control a servomotor . \" It 's more user friendly for the teach pendant and programming because the servo-driven EOAT shows up as a 7th axis just like any other axis on the robot . It 's more work on our end , but much more user friendly . \" <p> \" By building the user friendliness right into the equipment , it 's also easier on the integrator , \" he adds . \" There 's less programming knowledge involved . If any portion of the project can be simplified , they can install it faster and troubleshoot it easier . \" <p> Applied Robotics ' Loos extols the benefits of servo-based , flexible grippers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part , meaning the robot programmer does n't have to hit that perfect spot all the time to grip the part . It saves an incredible amount of time . Servo also gives you an almost infinite range of options in positioning . Whereas an air cylinder-based clamp is either open or it 's closed . You 're either grabbing or you 're not grabbing . With servo you can engage a part that is slightly irregular or packaged in a slightly irregular way . \" <p> This video shows a compact , servo-driven gripper used for biomedical applications where tight tolerances are often required . \" It has to fit in tight spaces , move precisely and handle product very gently , \" says Loos . \" In tight spaces , like handling titration trays , tubes , etc. , the consequences of a dropped item are very steep . \" <p> Modular Vacuum Grippers End-of-arm tooling designed to handle various kinds of materials in varying shapes and sizes is also trending . \" Many of our customers are looking for lighter-weight tooling , especially when they want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more flexibility in the EOAT often means more components and more weight ) but at same time they still want to use the smallest robot possible , \" says Volker Schmitz , President of Schmalz Inc. in Raleigh , North Carolina . <p> \" This is especially true in the consumer goods industry where the packaging is changing so often , \" he adds . \" Customers are asking for tooling that will not only handle their current packaging , but packaging two to three years down the road , but we do n't know what it 's going to look like in the future . \" <p> Schmalz recently launched its large-area vacuum gripping system , the FMP . The patent-pending \" vacuum bars \" as Schmitz refers to them are designed to handle various materials such as wood , metal sheet , glass , cardboard , or plastic with different shapes , surfaces and dimensions . <p> \" With suction cups , the problem is that the cup has to completely cover a product , \" explains Schmitz . \" If it hits half on a box or pouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not generating vacuum and it 's just leaking air . \" <p> \" The vacuum bar does n't care where the product is located . It 's kind of like a vacuum cleaner in how anything underneath it gets sucked up . But it does n't have to perfectly seal around everything that it 's gripping . The vacuum bars can handle a lot of different shaped and sized products without having to change the gripper . \" <p> \" If the product is a sheet metal or a glass , or these paver stones ( as shown ) , that stay level or flat , then we can pick those up with an engineered foam and that 's usually the best product because it 's the most versatile on those kinds of materials . \" <p> Hybrid Tooling Another trend is ' hybrid tooling ' that combines multiple gripper technologies in one end-of-arm tool . \" Customers want one universal gripper for all parts , \" says Schmitz . \" So that 's what we try to focus on , is engineering an EOAT that will grip all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sometimes have to use a combination of different technologies all in one tool . For example , part of the tool will have suction . Another part will have a mechanical clamping arm around it . \" <p> This video shows a hybrid EOAT in a palletizing demo moving entire layers of different materials . <p> Advanced Tool Changers No stranger to the EOAT market , tool changers have continued to get more flexible , robust and easier to use . But with these advancements come new challenges . <p> \" We 're seeing demand for tool changers that have the ability to pass through more utilities , and even more challenging needs like incorporating vision and different bus networks , \" says Catherine Morris , Director of Automotive Sales at ATI Industrial Automation in Apex , North Carolina . <p> \" Tool changers have had electric and air pass-through for awhile , \" says Dan Peretz , VP North America of IPR Robotics Inc. in Troy , Michigan . \" The trend now is allowing other materials to pass through the tool changer . IPR has developed patented tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is paint , PVC or wax . There are a variety of different materials being applied in various applications . \" <p> \" We 're expanding into areas requiring components that can stand up to extreme heat , extreme cold , high-pressure water applications , both for high-pressure cleaning and underwater applications , and other extremes such as radiation , \" says Bob Little , ATI 's CEO . <p> ATI recently introduced its largest tool changer , the QC-1510 Heavy-Duty Tool Changer , which can handle payloads up to 4,080 kg . The modular construction allows integration with applications requiring high-power , coolant , servo , a variety of bus networks , and discrete signal capabilities by incorporating separate modules that can be mounted on any of nine available flats . <p> Along with the largest , ATI also recently developed its smallest tool changer . The QC-001 Micro Tool Changer weighs less than 122 grams while handling up to 1.4-kg payloads . Morris says the micro was developed in response to robot manufacturers introducing high-speed delta robots . <p> \" On the other side of the spectrum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , was developed in response to a non-robotic application , \" says Morris . \" It was a big gantry system where they were trying to move around half of an airplane and our strongest was n't quite up to it . \" <p> In addition to the flexibility tool changers provide and the safety aspects of reducing the frequency the operator has to enter the robot cell to change end effectors , ATI 's CEO says one of the primary benefits of tool changers is maintenance . \" It 's a time issue . When we 're talking about somebody changing out an end effector , we 're looking at maybe 20 minutes of work for somebody to get it off a robot and get another one back on . A tool changer can do it in 3 to 6 seconds . \" <p> \" Then you have the other benefit which is quality , \" Little continues . \" When a robot is exchanging tools with a tool changer , it 's done quickly and accurately . If it 's done manually , you have the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . That can create a malfunction later in the line . \" <p> This video shows one of ATI 's tool changers in action exchanging packaging end effectors . <p> Intelligent Control Modules Part of making end-of-arm tooling more intelligent is allowing for better communication between the robot and the end effector , and ultimately providing valuable feedback to the end user . Intelligent control modules are bridging the gap between the robot controller , the tool changer and the end effector modules . <p> Applied Robotics released the latest iteration of its SmartComm ? Control Module . The system 's designer , Henry Loos , describes how it works to the end user 's advantage . <p> \" Not only does it allow our customer to change tooling without suffering any ill network and bus effects , we can now look at the customer 's devices on the end-of-arm tooling and report back to him with any issues about his EOAT , even if it 's not our end effector . Our aim was to make this much easier for maintenance by doing some of that work for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique in that it is designed to intrinsically handle many of the standard bus networks on the market without having to completely redesign the system , especially if last-minute changes are made to the bus , \" says Loos . \" And it can talk to any robot controller . \" <p> The control module is designed to work with Applied 's Sigma line of tool changers , including its newly released Sigma NextGen ? tool changer ( shown in the photo ) . Loos says it 's the strongest tool changer in its class with driver design and cam geometry to provide increased moment and acceleration at high payloads , up to 1,500 kg . <p> \" It has a fail-safe coupling mechanism . We can lose nearly all of the air to the changer and still maintain our moment and load rating somewhere up to around 80 percent of total , \" Loos adds . \" It takes a little more time ( milliseconds ) to fully engage those cams into a coupled state , but once we get there we 're so much safer against loss of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high part variability , tool changers may not always be practical . That 's where highly adaptable , anthropomorphic end effectors are entering the work envelope . <p> Anthropomorphic and Adaptable Finger Grippers Largely confined to research labs until recently , where their flexibility and versatility were sought after for testing disruptive robotics technologies , a new breed of anthropomorphic grippers are increasingly strutting their digits on the factory floor . They have grabbed the attention of human collaborative robots designed to work alongside humans in less-structured environments and in small to midsized businesses where robotics is becoming more accessible . <p> \" Manufacturers are looking for reliable , rugged , flexible and reusable handling solutions , \" says Guy Robert , Director of Marketing at Robotiq in Saint-Nicolas , Quebec , Canada . \" In past years , manufacturers have seen tool changers as a solution . But costs related to custom tooling design and changeovers made this solution not so attractive for many manufacturers who have to produce parts in low volume . \" <p> \" Manufacturers are also looking to automate applications where there is a high mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle due to their shape or the material ( fragile , brittle ) used to build them . So having a flexible handling tool that can grip a wide variety of parts becomes very important . It becomes even more important when manufacturers want to use this same tool for future production processes . \" <p> A relatively young company in the end-of-arm tooling arena , Robotiq offers a line of flexible and adaptive industrial robot grippers with what Robert refers to as \" mechanical intelligence \" designed to handle a wide variety of part shapes , sizes and composite materials . The idea is that by using a single robot gripper , the user saves on tooling costs and can improve process efficiencies . <p> Robotiq 's electric , servo-driven 2-finger and 3-finger grippers enable the user to control grasping factors such as the opening\/closing speed of the fingers , force applied on the object being handled , and precise control of the fingers to enable partial open and close for fast cycle times . <p> The adaptive 2-finger grippers are designed for day-to-day manufacturing where engineers want to automate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical cell has to handle 5 to 20 different parts , and instead of using a tool changer with many different end effectors , a single robot gripper represents time saved on changeovers and reduced tooling costs . <p> This video shows a variety of applications for Robotiq adaptable grippers , including bin picking , machine tending and flexible fixturing for welding . <p> The 3-finger gripper is designed for advanced manufacturing and research . According to Robotiq , it combines the flexibility of anthropomorphic functionality with the reliability of manufacturing EOAT , and reduces programming complexity while providing more gripping options . <p> In this video Robotiq 3-finger grippers are used to perform 3D bin picking and assembly tasks . They even wield traditional tools for some operations . <p> Another relative newcomer to the robotic EOAT stage is attracting attention with a magnetic personality . <p> Switchable Magnetic Technology A magnetic technology originally hailing from Down Under is creating buzz in the automation world . Switchable permanent magnets emerged from a five-year strategic R&amp;D program funded by the Australian government . <p> This patented technology uses opposing magnetic fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse the magnetic field . Commercialization of the technology was launched by Magswitch Technology from its headquarters in Colorado , where all Magswitch products were designed and tested , most notably a new line of magnetic robot grippers like no other . <p> \" We 're different because other end effectors on the market use high air pressure to rip a magnet away from the material , which causes impact stress on the magnet and results in shorter service life , \" says Michael Blanchard , Engineering Manager at Magswitch Technology Inc. in Westminster , Colorado . <p> Unlike electromagnets , Magswitch end effectors will remain in the on position if the system loses electric input or air . Blanchard also notes that electromagnets require battery backup and expensive cabling that must be replaced every year . <p> \" Our magnets are much lighter , stronger and easier to turn on and off than any other magnetic switches . Our smallest tool weighs 0.2 lb and has a maximum holding force of 55 lbf . Mechanical grippers are inherently heavy pieces of equipment on the order of three to five times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robot that is 20 to 35 percent smaller . \" <p> But they can go big , too . You may have seen Magswitch in action at IMTS in Chicago . This video from the event shows a FANUC M-2000iA robot bench-pressing a 1200-kg railway wheelset using 8 Magswitch magnets generating a combined gripping force of 24,000 lbf . <p> The Magswitch automation line has five product areas . The three primary gripper models include the M-Series , which is a small , single housing designed for flat surfaces . The AR-Series grippers are designed for irregular shapes and come with removable , customizable pole shoes , which Blanchard says customers can cut to fit their particular part configuration . <p> \" Our circular array tool ( the AY-Series shown in the photo ) is a patented design that uses multiple magnets with different magnetic fields to create a very shallow depth of field to destack sheet material , \" explains Blanchard . \" We can land on a piece of material 0.7 mil thick and take one sheet off of the top of another . It has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly and do n't necessarily have to be in balance . \" <p> In this video , Magswitch grippers are used in an automotive manufacturing facility to sort and stage small door panel inner components for a subsequent welding process . In the first phase of the process a delta robot is using vision guidance and a Magswitch AR gripper with extended pole shoes to pick , sort and place different parts onto the appropriate conveyor channels . <p> Once on the conveyors , the parts are picked by an articulating robot equipped with a high-speed rotary tool and Magswitch AR grippers , each with particular pole-shoe styles custom cut to fit each part configuration . The robot then uses the rotary tool to nest the parts into the appropriate welding fixtures on a turntable . <p> Right now , a small amount of air is required to turn the magnets on and off . \" The largest consumable cost in most production lines is the generation of vacuum , \" says Blanchard . \" We reduce the consumption of air by around 90 percent . Many factories are trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology in 2015 . \" <p> Application-Specific Grippers In order to differentiate themselves and meet demands of an ever-increasing number of industries and applications implementing automation , EOAT manufacturers are exploring specialized solutions for unique or extreme applications . <p> SAS Automation designed and developed specialized needle grippers used for removing muffins , cupcakes and other baked goods from baking pans , a process called ' depanning . ' Designed for high-volume , low maintenance depanning , the SAS Muffin Depanner has custom stainless steel needle grippers , each using 4 curved needles to depan 144 muffins from 2 moving baking pans on an oven conveyor . <p> SAS ' engineering manager says the small-diameter needles leave limited evidence of penetration . \" This application also involves hygienic design with stainless steels and food-grade-type polymers , so that everything can be washed down and cleaned , \" says Westbeld . \" We 've also used this style of gripper to handle vinyl for automotive applications . \" <p> IPR Robotics custom-designed an end-of-arm tool for handling aluminum die cast automotive engine blocks . The pneumatic-driven EOAT is two-sided for loading\/unloading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on one side . The other side incorporates 3-jaw grippers , 4 in a row , for loading sleeve inserts into the mold prior to casting the part . <p> \" The end-of-arm tool has to be very precise in order to properly insert the liner sleeves into the molds before loading the part , \" says IPR 's Peretz . \" It also has to be robust to withstand extreme temperatures . \" <p> \" The tooling manufacturers that are going to continue to thrive , \" says Schmitz , \" are the ones that are adopting or embracing as many technologies as possible for gripping and combining them to come up with new solutions . \" <p> From dual-duty grippers to intelligent communication modules , the scope of end-of-arm tooling is reaching broader and aiming higher to make the entire robotic system more effective and efficient .

and underwater applications , and other extremes such as radiation , \" says bob little , ati 's ceo . <p> ati recently introduced its largest tool changer , the qc-1510 heavy-duty tool changer , which can handle payloads up to 4,080 kg . the modular construction allows integration with applications requiring high-power , coolant , servo , a variety of bus networks , and discrete signal capabilities by incorporating separate modules that can be mounted on any of nine available flats . <p> along with the largest , ati also recently developed its smallest tool changer . the qc-001 micro tool changer weighs less than 122 grams while handling up to 1.4-kg payloads . morris says the micro was developed in response to robot manufacturers introducing high-speed delta robots . <p> \" on the other side of the spectrum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , was developed in response to a non-robotic application , \" says morris . \" it was a big gantry system where they were trying to move around half of an airplane and our strongest was n't quite up to it . \" <p> in addition to the flexibility tool changers provide and the safety aspects of reducing the frequency the operator has to enter the robot cell to change end effectors , ati 's ceo says one of the primary benefits of tool changers is maintenance . \" it 's a time issue . when we 're talking about somebody changing out an end effector , we 're looking at maybe 20 minutes of work for somebody to get it off a robot and get another one back on . a tool changer can do it in 3 to 6 seconds . \" <p> \" then you have the other benefit which is quality , \" little continues . \" when a robot is exchanging tools with a tool changer , it 's done quickly and accurately . if it 's done manually , you have the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . that can create a malfunction later in the line . \" <p> this video shows one of ati 's tool changers in action exchanging packaging end effectors . <p> intelligent control modules part of making end-of-arm tooling more intelligent is allowing for better communication between the robot and the end effector , and ultimately providing valuable feedback to the end user . intelligent control modules are bridging the gap between the robot controller , the tool changer and the end effector modules . <p> applied robotics released the latest iteration of its smartcomm ? control module . the system 's designer , henry loos , describes how it works to the end user 's advantage . <p> \" not only does it allow our customer to change tooling without suffering any ill network and bus effects , we can now look at the customer 's devices on the end-of-arm tooling and report back to him with any issues about his eoat , even if it 's not our end effector . our aim was to make this much easier for maintenance by doing some of that work for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique in that it is designed to intrinsically handle many of the standard bus networks on the market without having to completely redesign the system , especially if last-minute changes are made to the bus , \" says loos . \" and it can talk to any robot controller . \" <p> the control module is designed to work with applied 's sigma line of tool changers , including its newly released sigma nextgen ? tool changer ( shown in the photo ) . loos says it 's the strongest tool changer in its class with driver design and cam geometry to provide increased moment and acceleration at high payloads , up to 1,500 kg . <p> \" it has a fail-safe coupling mechanism . we can lose nearly all of the air to the changer and still maintain our moment and load rating somewhere up to around 80 percent of total , \" loos adds . \" it takes a little more time ( milliseconds ) to fully engage those cams into a coupled state , but once we get there we 're so much safer against loss of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high part variability , tool changers may not always be practical . that 's where highly adaptable , anthropomorphic end effectors are entering the work envelope . <p> anthropomorphic and adaptable finger grippers largely confined to research labs until recently , where their flexibility and versatility were sought after for testing disruptive robotics technologies , a new breed of anthropomorphic grippers are increasingly strutting their digits on the factory floor . they have grabbed the attention of human collaborative robots designed to work alongside humans in less-structured environments and in small to midsized businesses where robotics is becoming more accessible . <p> \" manufacturers are looking for reliable , rugged , flexible and reusable handling solutions , \" says guy robert , director of marketing at robotiq in saint-nicolas , quebec , canada . \" in past years , manufacturers have seen tool changers as a solution . but costs related to custom tooling design and changeovers made this solution not so attractive for many manufacturers who have to produce parts in low volume . \" <p> \" manufacturers are also looking to automate applications where there is a high mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle due to their shape or the material ( fragile , brittle ) used to build them . so having a flexible handling tool that can grip a wide variety of parts becomes very important . it becomes even more important when manufacturers want to use this same tool for future production processes . \" <p> a relatively young company in the end-of-arm tooling arena , robotiq offers a line of flexible and adaptive industrial robot grippers with what robert refers to as \" mechanical intelligence \" designed to handle a wide variety of part shapes , sizes and composite materials . the idea is that by using a single robot gripper , the user saves on tooling costs and can improve process efficiencies . <p> robotiq 's electric , servo-driven 2-finger and 3-finger grippers enable the user to control grasping factors such as the opening\/closing speed of the fingers , force applied on the object being handled , and precise control of the fingers to enable partial open and close for fast cycle times . <p> the adaptive 2-finger grippers are designed for day-to-day manufacturing where engineers want to automate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical cell has to handle 5 to 20 different parts , and instead of using a tool changer with many different end effectors , a single robot gripper represents time saved on changeovers and reduced tooling costs . <p> this video shows a variety of applications for robotiq adaptable grippers , including bin picking , machine tending and flexible fixturing for welding . <p> the 3-finger gripper is designed for advanced manufacturing and research . according to robotiq , it combines the flexibility of anthropomorphic functionality with the reliability of manufacturing eoat , and reduces programming complexity while providing more gripping options . <p> in this video robotiq 3-finger grippers are used to perform 3d bin picking and assembly tasks . they even wield traditional tools for some operations . <p> another relative newcomer to the robotic eoat stage is attracting attention with a magnetic personality . <p> switchable magnetic technology a magnetic technology originally hailing from down under is creating buzz in the automation world . switchable permanent magnets emerged from a five-year strategic r&amp;d program funded by the australian government . <p> this patented technology uses opposing magnetic fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse the magnetic field . commercialization of the technology was launched by magswitch technology from its headquarters in colorado , where all magswitch products were designed and tested , most notably a new line of magnetic robot grippers like no other . <p> \" we 're different because other end effectors on the market use high air pressure to rip a magnet away from the material , which causes impact stress on the magnet and results in shorter service life , \" says michael blanchard , engineering manager at magswitch technology inc. in westminster , colorado . <p> unlike electromagnets , magswitch end effectors will remain in the on position if the system loses electric input or air . blanchard also notes that electromagnets require battery backup and expensive cabling that must be replaced every year . <p> \" our magnets are much lighter , stronger and easier to turn on and off than any other magnetic switches . our smallest tool weighs 0.2 lb and has a maximum holding force of 55 lbf . mechanical grippers are inherently heavy pieces of equipment on the order of three to five times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robot that is 20 to 35 percent smaller . \" <p> but they can go big , too . you may have seen magswitch in action at imts in chicago . this video from the event shows a fanuc m-2000ia robot bench-pressing a 1200-kg railway wheelset using 8 magswitch magnets generating a combined gripping force of 24,000 lbf . <p> the magswitch automation line has five product areas . the three primary gripper models include the m-series , which is a small , single housing designed for flat surfaces . the ar-series grippers are designed for irregular shapes and come with removable , customizable pole shoes , which blanchard says customers can cut to fit their particular part configuration . <p> \" our circular array tool ( the ay-series shown in the photo ) is a patented design that uses multiple magnets with different magnetic fields to create a very shallow depth of field to destack sheet material , \" explains blanchard . \" we can land on a piece of material 0.7 mil thick and take one sheet off of the top of another . it has a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly and do n't necessarily have to be in balance . \" <p> in this video , magswitch grippers are used in an automotive manufacturing facility to sort and stage small door panel inner components for a subsequent welding process . in the first phase of the process a delta robot is using vision guidance and a magswitch ar gripper with extended pole shoes to pick , sort and place different parts onto the appropriate conveyor channels . <p> once on the conveyors , the parts are picked by an articulating robot equipped with a high-speed rotary tool and magswitch ar grippers , each with particular pole-shoe styles custom cut to fit each part configuration . the robot then uses the rotary tool to nest the parts into the appropriate welding fixtures on a turntable . <p> right now , a small amount of air is required to turn the magnets on and off . \" the largest consumable cost in most production lines is the generation of vacuum , \" says blanchard . \" we reduce the consumption of air by around 90 percent . many factories are trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology in 2015 . \" <p> application-specific grippers in order to differentiate themselves and meet demands of an ever-increasing number of industries and applications implementing automation , eoat manufacturers are exploring specialized solutions for unique or extreme applications . <p> sas automation designed and developed specialized needle grippers used for removing muffins , cupcakes and other baked goods from baking pans , a process called ' depanning . ' designed for high-volume , low maintenance depanning , the sas muffin depanner has custom stainless steel needle grippers , each using 4 curved needles to depan 144 muffins from 2 moving baking pans on an oven conveyor . <p> sas ' engineering manager says the small-diameter needles leave limited evidence of penetration . \" this application also involves hygienic design with stainless steels and food-grade-type polymers , so that everything can be washed down and cleaned , \" says westbeld . \" we 've also used this style of gripper to handle vinyl for automotive applications . \" <p> ipr robotics custom-designed an end-of-arm tool for handling aluminum die cast automotive engine blocks . the pneumatic-driven eoat is two-sided for loading\/unloading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on one side . the other side incorporates 3-jaw grippers , 4 in a row , for loading sleeve inserts into the mold prior to casting the part . <p> \" the end-of-arm tool has to be very precise in order to properly insert the liner sleeves into the molds before loading the part , \" says ipr 's peretz . \" it also has to be robust to withstand extreme temperatures . \" <p> \" the tooling manufacturers that are going to continue to thrive , \" says schmitz , \" are the ones that are adopting or embracing as many technologies as possible for gripping and combining them to come up with new solutions . \" <p> from dual-duty grippers to intelligent communication modules , the scope of end-of-arm tooling is reaching broader and aiming higher to make the entire robotic system more effective and efficient .

But new episodes are finally in the pipeline , ready to come climbing out of that subway station and onto your TV next spring . <p> Last night as part of the Paley Center 's Made in NY television festival , I moderated a panel with Louis CK and his Louie co-executive producer Blair Breard , who said that Louie season 4 went into production this week , with the goal of returning to FX next May . <p> The **30;0;TOOLONG said he took a long-than-usual break between seasons to regain some semblance of a life , as well as to avoid the chaotic production schedule of the show 's first three seasons , when he would be promoting the show 's premiere while still writing and shooting new episodes . For the first time , he 's written a full season of scripts before shooting begins , allowing for a little more polish and ambition in the season . <p> What kind of ambition , Louis CK would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will include more stories that span more than one episode as well as shorter ones . There will be more straight-ahead comedic episodes , as well as some that \" I have a stomach ache about . \" <p> ( One multi-part story for next year , he says , was originally an idea for a movie . Interestingly , he added , that was also the genesis of the season 1 \" God \" episode -- about Louie 's past as a religiously-guilty kid -- except that the movie involved statues of the crucified Jesus coming to life and strangling people . ) <p> Before the panel , the Paley Center screened two episodes , which exemplified the show 's range of tones : \" Daddy 's Girlfriend , Part 2 , \" a sweet , disturbing first-date story ( guest-starring Parker Posey ) , which includes some glorious scenes of the city at night ; and \" Barney\/Never , \" which climaxes in a shot of a kid soaking in a diarrhea-polluted bathtub . ( First question , of course , had to be how they simulated the fouled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Girlfriend , \" Louis CK said , is an example of how New York City permeates the show , both visually and in character . Because Louie shoot almost entirely on location -- a move that cuts costs while making it look more expensive -- it can capture both the city 's sleaze and glorious scenes like a montage of Posey and Louis CK gorging on cured fish at Russ and Daughters . And the Posey character , he said , reflected some dates he had in his early days in the city . The thing about New York : \" There are a lot of crazy people who do n't look crazy . \" <p> A few other topics that came up , in our interview and in questions from the audience : <p> * Last year 's finale , \" New Year 's Eve , \" was shot partly in Beijing ( though Breard first suggested they shoot in Chinatown ) . One problem , once they arrived in China , was how much of it in fact \" looks like Columbus , Ohio . \" On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street in China compared with NYC , \" because people do n't have rights . \" <p> * An audience member asked about a scene in season 3 , in which a character played by Melissa Leo roughly forces Louie to reciprocate oral sex . Louis CK said he did n't consider the scene rape -- \" She did what she had to do , \" he said drily -- though he acknowledged an earlier episode in which his character appears to be molested under anesthesia by a dentist . Asked if FX had issues with the content , he joked , \" I said , either I get raped , or I 'm not doing the show . \" <p> * Toughest place to shoot in New York City ? What 's the toughest place to do anything in New York City ? Yep , the subway . <p> * Could a big network make a show like Louie ? No , he said , nor should they . When you 're making a show for millions of dollars an episode , \" that money comes with a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as advertisers who do n't want to be near offensive content . \" Our advertisers are , what , Red Stripe beer ? They do n't give a fuck what we 're doing ! \" <p> And that 's as it should be , he said .

        "text":"<p> Shot in Portland , Ore. , the Falls saga follows the doomed romance of two Mormon youth who discover much more than God whilst doing their mission work . Testament of Love picks up the story five years after we last saw the pair of conflicted lovers and is set to take the 2013 festival circuit by storm this fall . <p> I caught up with Garcia this week to chat about the film . Read our interview after the trailer below . <p> Logan Lynn : Hi , Jon . For our readers who have not seen The Falls , could you give us the rundown on the story of the original film ? <p> Jon Garcia : The Falls is the story of Chris Merrill and RJ Smith , two Mormon missionaries that fall in love on their mission . RJ is assigned to live with senior companion Chris Merrill , who teaches him the daily regimen of missionary life . As teaches the word of \" our heavenly father , \" they realize there is so much more to life . While in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lynn : Sounds hot . What moved you to make the first movie ? Is it autobiographical ? <p> Garcia : I was raised Catholic , so I did not live through these experiences the way that RJ and Chris did , but I can identify with these characters in many ways . I was writing a very different story in 2010 , until I spoke with two friends who had grow up Mormon and had such experiences . They spoke of the struggle they endured while serving their church and falling in love with the young men they were missionary companions with . Neither were excommunicated , but what happened on their mission was brought to the attention of their mission president , then eventually to their families back home . It was a traumatic experience for both of them . I was then inspired to change the direction of my story about a young gay teenager living in the middle of Idaho to a 19-year-old Mormon young man about to leave home for the first time to go on his mission . <p> Lynn : The Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month at the Portland Lesbian and Gay Film Festival . Tell me a little bit about the sequel . <p> Garcia : The Falls : Testament of Love takes place five years after their mission . The way The Falls concluded was purposefully left open-ended , but my intention was to give the impression that Chris and RJ would get together after their mission and take a road trip across America , no longer as elders but as two young men with their whole lives ahead of them . The two young men are now 25 and living very different lives , Chris is still a devout Mormon , and RJ is living out and gay in Seattle , Wash . An unexpected event leads both men back to the small town where they served their mission . As old feelings rise to the surface , Chris and RJ risk hurting the ones they love as they pursue their desire to be together . <p> Lynn : Did you always know there would be a second part to this story ? <p> Garcia : I did n't know I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls , however , I kept receiving emails from individuals all over the world asking me about the ending and what happened to these young men after their mission . I was curious myself , and I 'd played it out in my mind , what I thought had happened . One day I called Breaking Glass Pictures , the distribution company who put out the first movie , and I told them I wanted to make a sequel . After a lot of discussion , I wrote the script , presented it to them , and was eventually given the green light to make the film . <p> Lynn : Nice . Both films were shot in Portland , Ore. , with a local cast . Why Portland ? <p> Garcia : I have shot most of my films in Portland because it is my home , and moving the production elsewhere could mean more cost . Portland is also graced with a pool of very talented actors . We are actually very lucky in that sense . I have a great crew that I work with here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make these movies because I have their support . <p> Lynn : If you could sum up the film in one word , what would it be ? <p> Garcia : \" Longing . \" <p> Lynn : How is life for queer Mormons these days ? Many churches in the evangelical movement are shifting their views . Are these changes happening in the Mormon Church as well ? <p> Garcia : From what I know , the Mormon Church is trying to change the way they are perceived in the public eye , but changes within stakes around the United States are happening very slowly . I know a few members of Affirmation , the gay and lesbian organization for former and presently practicing Mormons , and to my knowledge this is evolving , but I ca n't say to what degree . I can say that we did have a cast member who was Mormon , and her views alone helped me realize that there are a lot of Mormons out there who see nothing wrong with LGBT individuals of faith . <p> Lynn : We came relatively close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What might that have meant for our country 's LGBTQ population ? <p> Garcia : I feel that Mitt Romney would have been a step back not only for the LGBT community but for women , education , the middle class and many other issues . Exodus International may not have closed , so therefore the ex-gay movement would still be in effect , and DOMA may not have been repealed . Editor 's note : The Defense of Marriage Act , or DOMA , was not repealed ; the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the law , Section 3 , which defined \" marriage \" as a legal union of one man and one woman for federal purposes . I also do n't think we would now have 13 states where gay marriage is legal . <p> Garcia : Ryan Gosling and Michael Fassbender ! I 'd cast them in the gay surfer cowboy movie I 've been wanting to make . It 's like Brokeback Mountain meets Point Break . I grew up in a beach town in south Texas . There were many surfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay , I 'm not sure , but one can dream . <p> Lynn : Yes . One can , and one should . Do you have plans for any more installments of The Falls , or does Testament of Love wrap things up for these two ? <p> Garcia : I do n't know ; it really depends on the reception of this film . I already know where I 'd take the story , though . Companion novels are already in the works , with the first coming out soon by author Marty Beaudet . <p> Lynn : Cool . What 's next for you ? <p> Garcia : My film The Hours till Daylight , about a Hispanic family in south Texas traumatized by paranormal phenomena , will be coming out in early 2014 . I shot the film in Bastrop , Texas , with a crew of three in the spring of 2012 , and it was recently picked up for distribution by Zahra Pictures . John Neff , who was David Lynch 's sound designer for years , is doing our score and sound design for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this project ! <p> Lynn : That does sound exciting . Thanks for chatting with me today . Any last words you would like to leave our readers with before we go ? <p> Garcia : I think where we stand as a country on gay and lesbian individuals of faith is one of the most important issues we are facing right now ; therefore , the timing of The Falls : Testament of Love could n't be better . I hope that people are more than entertained by this film . I feel this movie provides perspective on how excluding the LGBT community from religious practices can be detrimental to the human spirit . ",

        "text":"<p> Who sent a bunch of hapless Russian soldiers of fortune to go do battle in Syria ? <p> By Michael WeissMichael Weiss is the editor in chief of the Interpreter , an online journal that translates and analyzes Russian media . Follow him on Twitter : @michaeldweiss . <p> November 21 , 2013 <p> In late October , amendments were made to Article 208 of the Russian Criminal Code outlawing the \" Organization of , or Participation in , Illegal Armed Units \" in foreign countries . Intended to stanch the rising flow of radical jihadists from the Russian Federation to Syria , and purposefully written to encompass foreign military activities for which the participant need not receive payment , the amended law now carries a six-year prison sentence for anyone found guilty of violating it . According to Sergei Smirnov , the first deputy director of Russia 's Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , some 300 to 400 fighters , mainly from the North Caucasus , are thought to have already joined with religious crusaders in trying to topple the regime of Syrian President Bashar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Article 359 , which dates back to 1996 , outlaws the more conventionally defined activity of the noncitizen mercenary -- as in the soldier of fortune who works for pay . Funnily enough , it 's that earlier statute that has already been broken by more than 200 Russians who just returned from a lackluster military performance in Syria . Only they were fighting for Damascus , not for al Qaeda . <p> In late October , international media outlets reported that Russian mercenaries appeared to have joined with Syrian army regulars in a fight against rebels . After a battle in Homs between regime troops and the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham , one of the two main al Qaeda groups in Syria , the jihadi website Kavkaz Center -- known more for its crude propaganda than its empirically verifiable information -- claimed that among the 100 enemy slain were several Russians . One of the dead was even named : Aleksei Malyuta , from the city of Abinsk in Krasnodar territory . Kavkaz posted videos , including one reportedly showing a Russian mercenary breaking a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as documents allegedly showing that Malyuta worked as a professional gun for hire for the Moran Security Group , a Moscow-based private military company , which had contracted a Hong Kong-registered entity called Slavonic Corps Ltd. to dispatch armed personnel to Syria . According to its website , Moran \" offers targeted approaches in the world 's current hot spots , such as the Middle East , Central Asia and Africa , which include the enlistment of local experts in these dynamic and highly sensitive environments . \" As for Slavonic Corps , on its website it claims to operate \" in strict correspondence to Russian law \" and \" never takes part in events related to overthrow of governments , violating human rights of civilian population and in any other actions violating International Law and Conventions . \" If one judges from some of the now-verified photographs that Kavkaz Center produced , these contracted \" local experts \" in Syria may have included the thuggish pro-regime shabiha , whose white trucks with mounted machine guns have become symbols of atrocity . <p> The story idled for several days until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives of Moran and Slavonic Corps . Alexey Badikov , a director of Moran , whose signature appeared on Malyuta 's personnel ID , which was obtained by jihadists in Syria , told Fontanka reporterDenis Korotkov that Malyuta did indeed work for Moran in 2012 and early 2013 and participated in seagoing operations to protect private merchant ships from piracy , though he did n't specify where . However , Badikov said , Slavonic Corps had no relationship with Moran , and Moran had n't contracted any work in Syria . <p> Fontanka proved that both assertions were false . It authenticated the ID documents published by the Kavkaz Center , proving that Malyuta did indeed have a contract with Slavonic Corps and was in Syria in October . But Malyuta , the newspaper found , was actually still quite alive and now back in Russia , celebrating his return with his brother , Sergei , who was the acting head of the same security detail in Syria , nine days after jihadists prematurely announced Aleksei Malyuta 's demise . Sergei Malyuta toldFontanka that Slavonic Corps contracted the Russian mercenaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \" guard and defense of economic facilities of the Syrian Republic . The point was to free the subdivisions of the Syrian army from these duties , so that they could take part in the battle against the bandits . \" Sergei Malyuta denied taking part in any clashes with jihadists or other rebels ; his brother 's documents , he said , were \" simply stolen \" out of an unattended backpack . As proof of life , Aleksei Malyuta sent Fontanka a video , taken in Russia , in which he was drinking and toasting to his good health . Fontanka further verified that all the mercenaries had returned safely but prematurely owing to the \" failure of the hosts to fulfill their financial obligations , which caused problems with the housing and feeding of the fighters from Slavonic Corps . \" The contract , apparently , had been broken . <p> But the story did n't end there . In a follow-up article published on Nov. 14 , Fontanka revealed that Russia 's domestic security service , the FSB , had arrested two high-ranking members of Slavonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal code 's old Article 359 . Moreover , since the spring of 2013 , Fontana 's Korotkov found , based on interviews with several ex-contractors , Slavonic Corps had been recruiting former soldiers with combat experience to guard \" energy facilities \" in exotic locales for the promise of $4,000 per month . Recruits were interviewed over the phone before meeting directly with the president of Moran , Vyacheslav Kalashnikov , a lieutenant colonel in the FSB reserves , \" who introduced himself as a general \" and explained what the overseas missions would entail . A second face-to-face interview followed at the Baltic Shooting Center on Alexander Blok Street in St. Petersburg , where the appropriate forms would be completed and \" passports ordered . \" Finally , recruits were invited to Moscow , where they were told , in Moran 's offices , that they 'd be subcontracted to Syria with Slavonic Corps . <p> The men were called up just as soon as they arrived back in St. Petersburg . \" Contracts with Hong Kong 's Slavonic Corps Limited were literally signed on knees on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Oleg Krinitsyn , the head of RSB-Group , Russia 's largest private military company , whom Fontanka interviewed , the Slavonic Corps team was a shambles from the start : <p> Among those guys , photographed against a backdrop of Syrian equipment , festooned with weapons , I noticed a few of our former employees who had been dismissed because of their poor moral character . I saw guys with criminal records amongst them . This once again confirms that the aim of the re cruiters was not to attract high-quality professionals , but just to plug a ' hole ' with cannon fodder , and fast . And the boys were sent on contracts that resembled contracts for suicide missions . Right away , people signed a contract that included a will to bury their remains in their homeland or , if that proved impossible , in the nation where they died , and then be reburied in Russia . Dreadful . <p> Moreover , Krinitsyn told the newspaper , the contract these mercenaries signed apparently had been commissioned not by any ministry in Damascus but by \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" Mark Galeotti , a New York University professor who specializes in the Russian security services , concluded , following the Interpreter 's translation of the Fontanka exclusives , that \" it is difficult to sustain any notion that at the very least the Russian government did not give this its blessing . \" <p> As recounted by several of them to Fontanka , the mercenaries were flown to Beirut and then traveled by car to Damascus , before being transferred to a military base in the coastal province of Latakia . The Russians say they were greeted as foreign heroes by regime loyalists and housed in the makeshift barracks at the former stables of a horse track , alongside Syrian reservists . In October , according to one recruit , there were 267 Slavonic Corps mercenaries in Syria , split into two companies , one of them made up entirely of Cossacks , with the expectation that the total force would grow to 2,000 over time . They were given assault rifles , machine guns , and grenade launchers as well as other Soviet-era hardware , some of it 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> When they spoke to us in Russia , they explained that we were going on a contract with the Syrian government ; they convinced us that everything was legal and in order . Like , our government and the FSB were on board and involved in the project . When we arrived there , it turned out that we were sent as gladiators , under a contract with some Syrian or other , who may or may not have a relationship with the government .... That meant that we were the private army of a local kingpin . But there was no turning back . As they said , a return ticket costs money , and we 'll work it off , whether we like it or not . <p> The manager of the entire outfit in Latakia was Vadim Gusev , identified by Fontanka as deputy director of Moran . ( According to documents Foreign Policy obtained from Slavonic Corps ' registry , Gusev also owns all 10,000 shares of the Hong Kong-based company . ) <p> The one and only actual campaign Slavonic 's mercenaries participated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of oil fields in Syria 's eastern province of Deir ez-Zor . Portraits of Assad and Baathist flags were stuck to Hyundai buses and JMC trucks as the men set off on a 350-mile trek eastward from Latakia across rebel-infiltrated terrain . Signs that their safety was n't really a paramount concern of their hosts became apparent immediately . Battle-ready T-72 tanks were replaced by older , dilapidated T-62s before the mission began back in Latakia . A Syrian helicopter , evidently mistaking the Russian convoy for enemy action , got itself tangled in power lines and crashed on top of the entire mercenary column albeit , wondrously , without killing anyone . Then , on Oct. 18 , the Slavonic Corps fighters met their bathetic Little Bighorn after getting stuck in the town of al-Sukhnah , Homs , where they were surrounded by a contingent of up to 6,000 anti-Assad rebels ( a figure almost surely exaggerated ) . \" Not wanting to die in vain for the ideals of the Syrian state , \" Korotkov writes rather grandly , the Russians \" jumped into their vehicles and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat , Alexei Malyuta 's bag was lost and fell into the hands of the regime 's opponents . \" And from there his ecstatic obituary was uploaded to the Kavkaz Center . <p> Six mercenaries were wounded in the melee , two seriously . But the mercenaries credited their escape and survival to a sandstorm that they say blinded the advancing jihadists . The Russians returned first to an air base in Homs where they recalled \" a loud argument ... between Vadim Gusev and the Syrian ' employer ' of the Slavonic Corps : It was clear that they had different views on the subsequent plan . Everybody heard their yells , including mentions of dollars and , more specifically , of $4 million , that would have to be worked off . \" In the event , nothing was worked off , and all 267 Russians drove back to the base camp in Latakia neither expecting a hero 's welcome nor receiving one ; instead , they were now scorned by the same crowd that had cheered them days earlier . A risky but remunerative assignment that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men were flown back to Moscow in the final days of October on two chartered planes . But as they filed off the planes at Moscow 's Vnukovo airport , all the men were taken into temporary custody by waiting FSB agents who confiscated their SIM cards , electronic media , and passports and began interrogating them individually . Gusev , the head of the mission , was arrested under Article 359 along with Evgeny Sidorov , Moran 's human resources head and a 20 percent owner of the company . Both men now face as many as eight years in prison for recruiting mercenaries . <p> Galeotti told the Interpreter that given Moran President Vyacheslav Kalashnikov 's background as an FSB reservist -- you never really \" retire \" from this status -- he and his private military company would have had \" frequent and dense \" contacts with the Russian security organs . \" Someone within the government apparatus must have put\/kept Syria on the list of countries where they are clear to work and processed their request , \" he said . Andrei Soldatov , another expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Restoration of Russia 's Security State and the Enduring Legacy of the KGB , agrees . \" We can not exclude the possibility that Kalashnikov just used his contacts in the FSB to get some good contracts in Syria , \" Soldatov said . \" I mean , it might be not that the FSB exploited him but that he exploited the FSB . \" <p> It 's not hard to surmise why the FSB would have turned on a company it may have given tacit support to send men into Syria . The mercenaries performed poorly in the field , and proof of their illicit activity had been plastered all over the Internet , so not tossing Gusev and Sidorov in the clink might have caused the kind of scandal that even an unembarrassable Kremlin would want to avoid . Moscow has been outspoken in its criticism of U.S. and Arab arms transfers to Syria 's rebels , even as its own state arms export company dispatches more and more sophisticated hardware to Assad , according to the State Department 's Robert Ford , the U.S. ambassador to Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperiled Geneva II peace conference takes place in December , just in time for the regime to be in a much- strengthened negotiating position after a series of tactical gains on the battlefield . <p> True , Russia has n't been shy about showing support for Assad even after the regime deployed chemical weapons on Aug. 21 ( something the Russian Foreign Ministry still denies ) . Reuters reported recently that second-tier Russian banks have been taking Syrian regime deposits , including barter accounts that would allow Damascus to import foodstuffs in exchange for oil or goods . Russian military technicians have also been in Syria to train and advise regime personnel on the use of Russian-sold air-defense systems . At least one \" former \" GRU ( Russian military intelligence ) officer took a bullet in the face while claiming to have been vacationing in the war zone and moonlighting as a correspondent with pro-regime Abkhazian Network News Agency . There were also rumors this past May that soldiers with the elite Zaslon ( \" Screen \" ) detachment of the Russian special forces were being sent to Syria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault . But all this , as the Kremlin loves to point out , has been undertaken strictly in compliance with \" international law \" and with respect to Syria 's state sovereignty . But evidence of Russian citizens breaking Russian law to fight in Syria -- that 's something that hard-line Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would find hard to explain in one of his big-grinning , palm-slapping rap sessions with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry . <p> Complicating things even more for Russia is that Moran may have violated sanctions on Syria -- in the British Virgin Islands . While Moran is technically registered in breezy see-no-evil Belize , it is 50 percent owned by an entity called Neova Holdings Ltd. , which is registered in the Caribbean territory , a favored offshore corporate landing post for Russian enterprises trying to obfuscate their ownership structures . ( In fact , even Moran 's domain name is registered to Neova Holdings . ) The islands constitute a British overseas territory , and as such , they typically comply with British , U.N. , or E.U. sanctions regimes . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services Commission announced that it was in full compliance with the European Union 's sanctions and arms embargo on Syria and would \" give effect to an asset freeze in relation to persons responsible for the violent repression against the Syrian population in Syria , persons and entities benefiting from or supporting the Assad regime . \" An attempt by Foreign Policyto reach the office of the British Virgin Islands ' premier for comment was unsuccessful . But regardless of what comes of the ongoing FSB investigation into Moran 's weekend-warrior work in Russia , its largest owner seems to have found itself on the wrong side of British Virgin Islands law . <p> Moran previously made international headlines way before its abbreviated adventurism in Homs . In October 2012 , one of its ships , the MV Myre Seadiver , was seized by the Nigerian Navy in Lagos , where it had docked temporarily to change crews en route from Madagascar to Conakry , Guinea . Fifteen Russian sailors on board , all of them comprising the new crew that had been replaced in port , were arrested . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not detained . ) Myre Seadiver , registered in the Cook Islands -- a territory legally bound to New Zealand -- but sailing under a Dutch flag , had a maritime registration certificate , dated June 2012 , authorizing the ship to \" store , carry and embark\/disembark arms &amp; ammunitions along with security teams . \" It found was carrying 14 AK-47s , 22 Benelli MR1 rifles , and thousands of rounds of ammunition for both , according to the Nigerians , who said that the vessel had no prior authorization to dock in the country or transport weapons . Nigeria is a hub for global arms trafficking , given its chronic problems with Islamist insurgents , oil bandits , and pirates . It took until February 2013 for the sailors of Myre Seadiver to be granted bail -- which also came along with a $500,000 demand for the release of the ship -- and remanded to the custody of the Russian ambassador in Lagos . ( The sailors were returned to Russia this past October . ) Yet one veteran Russia watcher , John Helmer , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault in this affair . <p> Moran has also cropped up in an unflattering light in a recent report by C4ADS , a nonprofit security and analysis firm based in Washington , D.C. \" The Odessa Network : Mapping Facilitators of Russian and Ukrainian Arms Transfers , \" written by C4ADS senior analyst Tom Wallace and Chief Operating Officer Farley Mesko , notes that one of Moran 's clients is the German-owned Hansa Heavy Lift ( HHL ) , the rebranded incarnation of Beluga Shipping , a bankrupted company that was notorious for Russian and Ukrainian arms trafficking through Europe . \" Two members of HHL 's four managing directors are Beluga veterans , \" Wallace and Mesko write , \" and a high percentage of HHL 's fleet is inherited from Beluga . Beluga was responsible for shipments of A.Q. Khan centrifuges to Libya , anti-tank missiles to Myanmar , and tanks to South Sudan . The exact nature of Moran 's relationship with HHL , or what kind of cargo they are hired to protect , is unknown . \" <p> Illegally running Keystone Cossacks into Homs and contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology is n't exactly a winning corporate profile , even in Vladimir Putin 's Russia . But Moran 's humiliating moment at the hands of jihadists in Syria , now confirmed by the Russian media , comes at an especially sensitive time for Moscow , which has lately been trying to host a meeting between Assad regime officials and representatives of the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition in advance of Geneva II . \" The Russian authorities are cracking down on these mercenaries because to not do so would compromise the image the Kremlin is trying to cultivate as a fair and neutral player in helping solve the Syria crisis , \" said Donald Jensen , a former U.S. diplomat in Russia and now a resident fellow at Johns Hopkins University 's Center for Transatlantic Relations . \" Russia wants to be the country all parties to the conflict have to turn to , rather than the United States . \" A surefire way to scupper this self-appointed role as peace broker for a 19-month civil war that has killed 115,000 people and externally or internally displaced millions more is to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shady private military company with ti es to Russian intelligence .

his brother 's documents , he said , were \" simply stolen \" out of an unattended backpack . as proof of life , aleksei malyuta sent fontanka a video , taken in russia , in which he was drinking and toasting to his good health . fontanka further verified that all the mercenaries had returned safely but prematurely owing to the \" failure of the hosts to fulfill their financial obligations , which caused problems with the housing and feeding of the fighters from slavonic corps . \" the contract , apparently , had been broken . <p> but the story did n't end there . in a follow-up article published on nov. 14 , fontanka revealed that russia 's domestic security service , the fsb , had arrested two high-ranking members of slavonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal code 's old article 359 . moreover , since the spring of 2013 , fontana 's korotkov found , based on interviews with several ex-contractors , slavonic corps had been recruiting former soldiers with combat experience to guard \" energy facilities \" in exotic locales for the promise of $4,000 per month . recruits were interviewed over the phone before meeting directly with the president of moran , vyacheslav kalashnikov , a lieutenant colonel in the fsb reserves , \" who introduced himself as a general \" and explained what the overseas missions would entail . a second face-to-face interview followed at the baltic shooting center on alexander blok street in st. petersburg , where the appropriate forms would be completed and \" passports ordered . \" finally , recruits were invited to moscow , where they were told , in moran 's offices , that they 'd be subcontracted to syria with slavonic corps . <p> the men were called up just as soon as they arrived back in st. petersburg . \" contracts with hong kong 's slavonic corps limited were literally signed on knees on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to oleg krinitsyn , the head of rsb-group , russia 's largest private military company , whom fontanka interviewed , the slavonic corps team was a shambles from the start : <p> among those guys , photographed against a backdrop of syrian equipment , festooned with weapons , i noticed a few of our former employees who had been dismissed because of their poor moral character . i saw guys with criminal records amongst them . this once again confirms that the aim of the re cruiters was not to attract high-quality professionals , but just to plug a ' hole ' with cannon fodder , and fast . and the boys were sent on contracts that resembled contracts for suicide missions . right away , people signed a contract that included a will to bury their remains in their homeland or , if that proved impossible , in the nation where they died , and then be reburied in russia . dreadful . <p> moreover , krinitsyn told the newspaper , the contract these mercenaries signed apparently had been commissioned not by any ministry in damascus but by \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" mark galeotti , a new york university professor who specializes in the russian security services , concluded , following the interpreter 's translation of the fontanka exclusives , that \" it is difficult to sustain any notion that at the very least the russian government did not give this its blessing . \" <p> as recounted by several of them to fontanka , the mercenaries were flown to beirut and then traveled by car to damascus , before being transferred to a military base in the coastal province of latakia . the russians say they were greeted as foreign heroes by regime loyalists and housed in the makeshift barracks at the former stables of a horse track , alongside syrian reservists . in october , according to one recruit , there were 267 slavonic corps mercenaries in syria , split into two companies , one of them made up entirely of cossacks , with the expectation that the total force would grow to 2,000 over time . they were given assault rifles , machine guns , and grenade launchers as well as other soviet-era hardware , some of it 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> when they spoke to us in russia , they explained that we were going on a contract with the syrian government ;

        "text":"<h> New iPad May Sport 1GB Of RAM , But Apple Will Never Say So <h> 0 <p> If you were hoping that the blitz of iPad news would end with the device 's long-awaited announcement yesterday , well , sorry . Even with Cupertino 's latest tablet waiting in the wings for a March 16 release , we 're all still speculating when it comes to some of the device 's particulars , and now the new iPad 's allotment of RAM is getting its share of the spotlight . <p> According to The Verge , the new iPad will indeed feature double the RAM of its immediate predecessor , with a full gigabyte of memory ensconced within its aluminum frame . But why does n't Apple ever talk about it ? <p> That Apple would make the jump to 1GB for their newest post-PC poster child should n't come as a surprise . The original model launched with 256MB of RAM onboard , which made for some iffy use experiences after a few software updates . The iPad 2 debuted with 512MB under the hood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a matter of time between new features and apps have iPad 2 users feeling the same sort of squeeze . <p> Now I ca n't speak for everyone , but my childhood in computing was spent scrounging together allowances for new RAM so my off-brand PC would n't chug quite so hard . As The Verge rightly points out , Apple 's iPad line to date has never blown the tech community away with the amount of RAM they 've included . Apple 's silence on that front is to be expected -- while they 're always eager to talk up their processors and their cameras , Apple has historically been content to leave the some of the technical specifics shrouded in mystery . <p> And why should n't they ? By throwing around adjectives like \" magical , \" \" incredible , \" and \" amazing \" at every possible opportunity , consumers are left to focus more on what they can do with an iPad rather than the little bits of silicon that make those experience happen .

Two of those outbreaks were connected to ground turkey , one contaminated with Salmonella Hadar and one with Salmonella Heidelberg , and one outbreak was connected to ground beef contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium . All of those bacteria were resistant to treatment from several antibiotics that are critically important to human medicine , including drugs in the penicillin , cephalosporin , and tetracycline families . <p> \" Antibiotics are the crown jewels of modern medicine , and they are critical to treating diseases in both humans and farm animals , \" said CSPI food safety director Caroline Smith DeWaal . \" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using them recklessly for non-therapeutic uses on farms and in animal factories .

The more antibiotics are used , the more bacteria will develop resistance ? often to more than one drug at a time . Pigs , chickens , and cattle are often administered antibiotics in their feed or water , to promote growth or to prevent diseases caused by overcrowding and unsanitary conditions , according to CSPI . Exacerbating the problem is that farmers in the U.S. can obtain and administer antibiotics without prescriptions or veterinary oversight . <p> The drug industry produced more than 29 million pounds of antimicrobial drugs approved for use in food animals , according to the Food and Drug Administration . CSPI says that food animals consume 80 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States and that 65 percent of those antibiotics are similar or identical to those used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotic-resistant foodborne illness outbreaks shows that outbreaks were most common in dairy products , with 12 such outbreaks since 1973 , and ground beef , with 10 outbreaks .

        "text":"<h> 8 strategies for reaching elusive young readers <p> Mainstream news organizations are not doing so well with young audiences . <p> Only 30 percent of people 18 to 34 read a newspaper in print or digitally on an average day , according to the Newspaper Association of America . That 's down from 35 percent in 2009 . <p> But there 's no reason to give up hope on reaching the digital and even print audiences of the future . Based on research and the advice of news outlets that do reach young people , here are some of the important steps you can take . <h> Create a separate product <p> You can take some steps to make your traditional news product more youth-friendly ( more on that below ) , but to best serve a younger audience you 'll want to carve out a separate staff and product . <p> The Chicago Tribune chose to solve the problem this way , by launching RedEye about 10 years ago as a free weekday publication targeting local 18- to 35-year-old readers . <p> RedEye adapts some news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has four general assignment reporters doing youth-oriented enterprise stories the mainstream press does n't cover . They take on beats like the local gay community , entry-level job markets , workplace cultural issues , local nightlife and dating . <p> \" At some point you have to have a voice and you have to stick to it , \" Ha said . \" And there 's going to be a certain type of audience that is drawn to that voice that wo n't be drawn to a different voice . You really ca n't mix them without alienating the other or changing who you are as a publication . \" <h> Hire young people <p> Do n't send a 50-year-old to do a 25-year-old 's job . <p> \" My newsroom at RedEye pretty much reflects the audience in terms of age and demographics and interests , \" Ha said . \" So we talk a lot about , ' What are your friends talking about ? What are they interested in ? What are n't they interested in ? ' We try to use people on staff as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same approach that helps BuzzFeed draw strong traffic from young people , especially those in college , Managing Editor Scott Lamb told me . <p> \" I 'm 36 , and I 'm definitely the oldest person on the editorial team , by a lot , \" Lamb said . \" We did that as a hiring strategy largely because we want people who are very native to things like Twitter and Facebook . \" <p> At the time Lamb and I were talking last week , the twoBuzzFeed posts getting the most traffic were written by an intern , Dave Stopera ( since hired full-time as an associate editor ) , who still has a year left to complete at New York University . <p> \" It does happen kind of naturally , because we 're hiring people who think about online content differently than I do , \" Lamb said . \" They 've grown up with it , and I think they make things for people like themselves . \" <h> Focus on relevance <p> Journalists may need to expand the boundaries of what they traditionally consider \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sense , it has to be relevant , \" said Danah Boyd , a Microsoft researcher and expert in youth media and privacy issues ( who also inspired this post with her recent criticism of how mainstream news organizations fail to serve young people ) . <p> \" If you 've never experienced any of the world outside of your friends and school , global news feels alien , \" Boyd told me . \" Young people are deeply engaged in the news of their peers , but we do n't call that news . \" <p> At RedEye , they define news not just by what seems important , but by what seems relevant to their audience . Sometimes those two are the same , but when they diverge , RedEye gives bigger play to the story its audience will find most relevant to their personal lives and experiences . <h> Include more context <p> Journalists need to find ways to make complex , ongoing storylines accessible to people who perhaps have n't been following every word since Day 1 . <p> That 's especially important to young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less regular intervals than do their elders and than did previous generations of young people , \" according to Christopher Sopher , who researched and blogged extensively on youth and the media , and now works for the Knight Foundation . \" On-demand news consumption , \" he continues , \" also means that ... online news institutions and even television would benefit from redesigning their content for a grazing audience , built to help readers and viewers dropping in at random times who may not have read yesterday 's story on a continuing topic . \" <p> In short , do n't let a news story get lost in minutiae . Remember to pull back , widen your focus , and explain where this story came from , where it 's heading and why it matters . Some cases might warrant a whole other kind of story -- an \" explainer \" that , as Jay Rosen put it , \" does n't provide the latest news or update you on a story , but addresses a gap in your understanding : the lack of essential background knowledge . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America and the Media Management Center at Northwestern University conducted a study in 2009 with 90-minute focus groups of teenagers across the country . <p> One of the key findings : \" What these teens said they want are news sites that do news well , not dumb it down or pose as experts in teen culture . \" <p> In other words , you serve young readers by making news clearer , fuller , more relevant and easier to digest -- not by sprinkling your copy with hip catchphrases . ( By the way , no one says \" hip \" anymore . ) <h> Be conversational <p> Most young people do n't look back fondly on their time sitting in giant lecture halls listening to a teacher dryly exposit facts . So they 're equally unexcited by many mainstream news outlets that communicate the same way . <p> The traditional style of newspaper writing is too impersonal and formulaic for younger readers . ( It 's not especially good writing for adult readers either , but they 're used to it . ) <p> What does \" conversational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one regular person sitting across a cafe table from you , asking what you 've heard today . <h> Use bite-sized facts <p> That NAA study referenced earlier found that \" almost universally , teens reject pages with uninterrupted text in favor of those that offer information in smaller , bite-sized chunks with multiple entry points . \" <p> Bullet points and subheadlines are your friend . Give each point its own distinct visual and narrative space . This is how RedEye applies the model even to solemn news like the Trayvon Martin killing : <h> Trayvon Martin : The big picture <p> The shooting death of Trayvon Martin has grabbed national headlines and renewed the conversation about race relations , gun laws and even how young men dress . ... Here are other notable events since the incident occurred last month . <p> &gt;&gt;Geraldo Rivera caused a stir when he claimed Martin 's hoodie was as responsible ... <p> &gt;&gt;ESPN has made an exception to its Twitter policy for the Martin case , permitting employees to wear hoodies in their online avatars ... <p> &gt;&gt;Players on the Miami Heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of the most popular teams in the league , took pictures of themselves last week wearing hoodies ... <p> &gt;&gt;Democrats on the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee are scheduled to hold an unofficial hearing Tuesday ... <p> &gt;&gt;The case has rippled across the nation and prompted rallies protesting the failure of the police to arrest the shooter ... <p> &gt;&gt;Declaring that \" If I had a son , he 'd look like Trayvon , \" President Obama on Friday joined the heated national debate ... <p> There are other less common story forms you also can use to break down information and make it easier to understand : Games , quizzes , even an educational coloring book for young children . <p> There 's a thin line , of course , between this directive and the advice not to \" dumb it down . \" Breaking information into digestible pieces does n't mean you have to deliver less information . <h> Ease off on those paywalls <p> Young readers may be one of the first casualties of a website 's paywall . <p> Many of them lack disposable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the appeal of spending it on your news product unless you 've overcome all the previously mentioned issues . <p> \" Young people are n't going out of their way to try to find this news , so you put up one little wall , and poof , done , \" Boyd said in her previous interview . \" ... When I hear news agencies talk about wanting to get young people , they do n't want to figure out how to actually inform them -- they want to hear how to monetize them . And that pisses me off . \" <p> Some of our readers objected to that comment , including Tennessean reporter Brian Haas : \" When I hear young people talk about consuming news , they do n't want to pay for it -- they want it all for free . And that pisses me off . \" <p> Boyd clarified this to me : \" I do n't object to monetization . I just think that when you lead with monetization , you often fail to engage people who are hesitant to engage in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we recognize that journalism has a public good responsibility as well as a bottom line responsibility . \" <p> If you can embrace some of these changes while staying true to your mission and not alienating your existing audience , you should be on your way to building important relationships with the next generation . <p> i like this simple think:Do n't send a 50-year-old to do a 25-year-old 's job . <p> Anonymous <p> It 's not you , it 's them . <p> Your 18 to 34 year olds are largely the product of school systems that have pursued test scores at the expense of curiousity , creativity and critical thinking .

        "title":"Suing the Department of Defense for Dereliction of Its Duty\n",
        "text":"<h> Suing the Department of Defense for Dereliction of Its Duty <p> This past Friday , Protect Our Defenders partnered with Susan Burke to file a lawsuit against West Point and the Naval Academy . The suit accuses the academies of failing to prosecute cadets and midshipmen who have raped their fellow students . <p> Burke filed the lawsuit four days after Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced what were touted as major reforms in the way the military handles sexual assault and rape . In reality , these so-called \" reforms \" fall well short of the fundamental reform required . The new policy does very little to address the culture of tolerance for rape that pervades the U.S. military and has given rise to the existing epidemic . <p> Plaintiffs Kelly Marquet and Anne Kendzior courageously stepped forth alleging their military academies \" have a high tolerance for sexual predators in the ranks and ' zero tolerance ' for those who rape ... \" <p> Marquet , a top Pennsylvania student and athlete , chose West Point over other top schools because she wanted to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second semester of her freshman year . Marquet contacted the West Point Sexual Assault Response Coordinator ( SARC ) for help . But instead of receiving support , she was punished for coming forward . Superiors allegedly forced Marquet to take out the trash from her rapist 's room daily and assigned her to do \" walking hours \" with him . Left with no other choice , she resigned . <p> Kendzior , a Texas high school soccer star , was recruited by top colleges and universities and chose to attend the Naval Academy . Kendzior alleges that different cadets raped her on two occasions . After struggling with the effects of the rapes on her own , Kendzior confided in her Academy counselor . The counselor discouraged her from reporting the rapes and Kendzior continued to suffer in isolation . Eventually the Naval Academy used her mental health records to disqualify her from commissioned officer status . Only her parents ' and Congressperson 's intervention prevented the Academy from committing her to a mental health facility . Kendzior was forced to leave the Academy without graduating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to protecting academy students from sexual violence and providing services for assault victims . The 2011 DOD annual report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the Military Service Academies found that West Point did not comply with the DoD 's sexual assault prevention policy and that the academies , in general , have failed to implement or enforce DoD policy . <p> According to the DoD , there were 65 reports of sexual assault in the academies in 2010 , up from 41 in 2009 . However , according to DoD surveys , less than 10 percent of the actual cases are reported . Common reasons for not reporting include : prevalence of victim blaming , fear of retaliation and career destruction , and the belief that the perpetrator will never be prosecuted . Indeed , of all the defendants accused in those 65 cases , only one has been court-martialed . <p> Instead of undertaking fundamental reforms , the Department of Defense has essentially maintained the status quo , while claiming \" reform . \" On April 16 , Secretary of Defense Panetta introduced a series of incremental policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the percentage of cases prosecuted ( the 2011 SAPRO report revealed only 8 percent of sexual assaults resulted in a court martial conviction ) . <p> Secretary Panetta deserves credit for doing more than his predecessors to call attention to this , in his own words , \" silent epidemic . \" However , many of the recently announced \" reforms \" are already in place , with limited effect at best , in one or more of the services . Furthermore , the centralized database , which Panetta characterized as a reform , was ordered by Congress to be operational by January 2010 . The DoD 's own reports indicate that these policies have not been effective in addressing the problem . <p> And then there 's the plan to move the authority for these cases up the chain of command . Touted as a significant change , Panetta 's directive requires local commanders to hand over investigations to higher-ranking officers . This appears to be an attempt to redirect attention away from the embarrassing statistics in the FY2011 Report on Sexual Assault in the Military released two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , court-martials fell and convictions plummeted -- with no indication that the number of sexual assaults have decreased . <p> Historically , there is no evidence that elevating the level of command is more likely to produce effective action . The Convening Authority can still unilaterally decide to not move forward with a court martial . The command structure is conflicted and in practice already has full authority and responsibility to deal with these cases . <p> We would like to believe that this most recent in a series of pledges of \" zero tolerance \" will make a difference . However , we would only know the Pentagon is serious and effective when the careers of those senior commanders who fail to provide positive leadership and take effective action are ended . Currently , it 's a greater risk to a commanding officer 's career to acknowledge that an attack occurred than it is for him to sweep it under the rug . <p> Paula Coughlin , a former Navy lieutenant and helicopter pilot , was sexually assaulted at the 1991 aviators ' Tailhook Association meeting . After her investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . And , in 1994 , due to further abuse and retaliation , she resigned . The Navy and Pentagon 's response to the resulting widespread negative publicity was to institute what were purported to be groundbreaking reforms . As is tragically clear from current reports , almost 20 years later , those policies have had little if any effect . <p> Commenting on the latest DoD reforms , Lt. Coughlin recently stated : \" The whole thing is poised to be completely ineffective . In 1992 , the convening authority in my case was deputy to the Commandant of the Marine Corps -- top grunt all the way ... he dismissed the case after a cordial meeting with the criminal 's minister . \" <p> Fourteen years after the Tailhook incident , as alleged in the lawsuit filed in March 2012 , former USMC Lt. Elle Helmer and Lt. Arianna Klay were raped and sexually assaulted by fellow Marines . Each suffered retaliation as a result of reporting . Investigations botched and rape kits \" lost . \" Lt. Klay and Helmer 's careers ruined . Both cases were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case two , three star Generals signed off . One alleged rapist remains a Marine in good standing . The other convicted but only of adultery and indecent language . <p> It is clear that many of the most egregious examples of command failure are occurring at or above the levels to which Secretary Panetta is \" elevating \" the responsibility . <p> In a democracy , we must hold institutions accountable for their transgressions . Just as the courts address patterns of abuse within religious institutions or corporations , Protect Our Defenders demands justice for the plaintiffs in this lawsuit . We need to leverage the powerful voice of the judiciary to achieve real change in the military 's practices . <p> The military has a long record of abuse within its ranks and impunity for perpetrators . It is apparent that the military bureaucracy is unwilling or unable to implement true reform autonomously . In additional to judicial redress , it appears only legislative action , which takes responsibility for victim care , investigation and adjudication out of the normal chain of command , will make a real difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our military and our democracy . It will assure parents that sending their children to serve our country will no longer mean putting them at great risk of sexual assault from their fellow service members . ",

leon panetta announced what were touted as major reforms in the way the military handles sexual assault and rape . in reality , these so-called \" reforms \" fall well short of the fundamental reform required . the new policy does very little to address the culture of tolerance for rape that pervades the u.s. military and has given rise to the existing epidemic . <p> plaintiffs kelly marquet and anne kendzior courageously stepped forth alleging their military academies \" have a high tolerance for sexual predators in the ranks and ' zero tolerance ' for those who rape ... \" <p> marquet , a top pennsylvania student and athlete , chose west point over other top schools because she wanted to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second semester of her freshman year . marquet contacted the west point sexual assault response coordinator ( sarc ) for help . but instead of receiving support , she was punished for coming forward . superiors allegedly forced marquet to take out the trash from her rapist 's room daily and assigned her to do \" walking hours \" with him . left with no other choice , she resigned . <p> kendzior , a texas high school soccer star , was recruited by top colleges and universities and chose to attend the naval academy . kendzior alleges that different cadets raped her on two occasions . after struggling with the effects of the rapes on her own , kendzior confided in her academy counselor . the counselor discouraged her from reporting the rapes and kendzior continued to suffer in isolation . eventually the naval academy used her mental health records to disqualify her from commissioned officer status . only her parents ' and congressperson 's intervention prevented the academy from committing her to a mental health facility . kendzior was forced to leave the academy without graduating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to protecting academy students from sexual violence and providing services for assault victims . the 2011 dod annual report on sexual harassment and violence at the military service academies found that west point did not comply with the dod 's sexual assault prevention policy and that the academies , in general , have failed to implement or enforce dod policy . <p> according to the dod , there were 65 reports of sexual assault in the academies in 2010 , up from 41 in 2009 . however , according to dod surveys , less than 10 percent of the actual cases are reported . common reasons for not reporting include : prevalence of victim blaming , fear of retaliation and career destruction , and the belief that the perpetrator will never be prosecuted . indeed , of all the defendants accused in those 65 cases , only one has been court-martialed . <p> instead of undertaking fundamental reforms , the department of defense has essentially maintained the status quo , while claiming \" reform . \" on april 16 , secretary of defense panetta introduced a series of incremental policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the percentage of cases prosecuted ( the 2011 sapro report revealed only 8 percent of sexual assaults resulted in a court martial conviction ) . <p> secretary panetta deserves credit for doing more than his predecessors to call attention to this , in his own words , \" silent epidemic . \" however , many of the recently announced \" reforms \" are already in place , with limited effect at best , in one or more of the services . furthermore , the centralized database , which panetta characterized as a reform , was ordered by congress to be operational by january 2010 . the dod 's own reports indicate that these policies have not been effective in addressing the problem . <p> and then there 's the plan to move the authority for these cases up the chain of command . touted as a significant change , panetta 's directive requires local commanders to hand over investigations to higher-ranking officers . this appears to be an attempt to redirect attention away from the embarrassing statistics in the fy2011 report on sexual assault in the military released two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , court-martials fell and convictions plummeted -- with no indication that the number of sexual assaults have decreased . <p> historically , there is no evidence that elevating the level of command is more likely to produce effective action . the convening authority can still unilaterally decide to not move forward with a court martial . the command structure is conflicted and in practice already has full authority and responsibility to deal with these cases . <p> we would like to believe that this most recent in a series of pledges of \" zero tolerance \" will make a difference . however , we would only know the pentagon is serious and effective when the careers of those senior commanders who fail to provide positive leadership and take effective action are ended . currently , it 's a greater risk to a commanding officer 's career to acknowledge that an attack occurred than it is for him to sweep it under the rug . <p> paula coughlin , a former navy lieutenant and helicopter pilot , was sexually assaulted at the 1991 aviators ' tailhook association meeting . after her investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . and , in 1994 , due to further abuse and retaliation , she resigned . the navy and pentagon 's response to the resulting widespread negative publicity was to institute what were purported to be groundbreaking reforms . as is tragically clear from current reports , almost 20 years later , those policies have had little if any effect . <p> commenting on the latest dod reforms , lt. coughlin recently stated : \" the whole thing is poised to be completely ineffective . in 1992 , the convening authority in my case was deputy to the commandant of the marine corps -- top grunt all the way ... he dismissed the case after a cordial meeting with the criminal 's minister . \" <p> fourteen years after the tailhook incident , as alleged in the lawsuit filed in march 2012 , former usmc lt. elle helmer and lt. arianna klay were raped and sexually assaulted by fellow marines . each suffered retaliation as a result of reporting . investigations botched and rape kits \" lost . \" lt. klay and helmer 's careers ruined . both cases were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case two , three star generals signed off . one alleged rapist remains a marine in good standing . the other convicted but only of adultery and indecent language . <p> it is clear that many of the most egregious examples of command failure are occurring at or above the levels to which secretary panetta is \" elevating \" the responsibility . <p> in a democracy , we must hold institutions accountable for their transgressions . just as the courts address patterns of abuse within religious institutions or corporations , protect our defenders demands justice for the plaintiffs in this lawsuit . we need to leverage the powerful voice of the judiciary to achieve real change in the military 's practices . <p> the military has a long record of abuse within its ranks and impunity for perpetrators . it is apparent that the military bureaucracy is unwilling or unable to implement true reform autonomously . in additional to judicial redress , it appears only legislative action , which takes responsibility for victim care , investigation and adjudication out of the normal chain of command , will make a real difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our military and our democracy . it will assure parents that sending their children to serve our country will no longer mean putting them at great risk of sexual assault from their fellow service members .

        "text":"<p> The e-mail arrived in James Charles Cafferty 's inbox on July 14 , 2011 . Unlike most unsolicited e-mail on the Internet , the message did not pitch mortgages , get rich quick scams , or penis pills . Instead , it provided a link to an under-the-radar child pornography website and the password needed to access it . Cafferty , a diplomatic security officer working for the US government at its London embassy , waited for three days , then clicked on the link . This is what he saw : <p> \" Welcome to the hidden side of yur soul , where you view the yung and innocent . We have been around since 2002 , offering the best of private and series Child Pornography ( CP ) , ( hardcore\/soft core ) all for FREE !

Yur old password wo n't work , so get the new one and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its target well ; Cafferty did have a hidden side of his soul . An online dating profile he created at the site Plenty of Fish said that he was looking for \" a relationship with someone who can enjoy the ' simple ' things of life such as walking in the park , enjoying a nice sunset , engaging in good conversation or go people watching at a caf ? . \" But he also craved child pornography . Cafferty owned a Drobo backup device that he stuffed with twin Western Digital hard drives in a RAID configuration to guard against data loss . On the drives , he kept his tens of thousands of child porn files . <p> Sometimes he did more than look at them , too . Cafferty would also fire up image editing software on his computer and splice his image into some scenes . <p> Below the website 's promotional copy sat a \" law enforcement note \" ; the kind that used to feature on warez sites as a talisman that might keep the cops at bay . \" If you happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing this website , it 's called free speech , \" it said . \" There is nothing illegal about this website . Our servers are located in a country that has no Child Pornography laws . Even if you are able to shut us down , we pop up again somewhere else ... \" <p> Cafferty stared at the screen , then typed in the password found in the e-mail . He was in . Another page popped up listing 35 free videos with names like \" Full version of known video . 3 10-12 y.o . girls and man \" and an explicit description of the action . Beside each video was a \" download \" button that provided one-minute previews of each video . Forty-nine seconds after entering his password , Cafferty clicked on video number four , a 71-minute file that claimed to feature a \" 9-10 y.o . girl and man . \" A third webpage opened to display the video , which appeared to buffer -- but the connection soon slowed and then stopped altogether . Eventually , Cafferty abandoned the site . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a data center , his online visit had tripped a silent alarm . That click on the \" download \" button had logged his IP address , the video file he attempted to view , and the number of times he tried to watch site videos . The law enforcement warning on the site 's front page had done nothing to keep the FBI away ; indeed , the FBI ran the site . <p> And now they had Cafferty . <p> Totally a legitimate website <h> Spear-phishing , FBI style <p> The e-mail had not arrived in Cafferty 's inbox by accident . Back in 2006 , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) had opened a major investigation into a string of child porn websites . As part of that work , ICE learned that the sites used PayPal to receive money and disguised the nature of the purchases by using odd subject identifiers . A website called Sick Child Room 2005 , for instance , used as its PayPal subject identifier the phrase \" SickCR Package v.5.06 Build 3638 \" -- which makes it sound like a software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names like \" Door 1 , \" \" Door 5 , \" and \" Medic 's Corner . \" Behind the doors waited 150 videos and 20,000 child porn images . <p> Cafferty 's mug shot <p> Pinellas County , Florida <p> ICE went to Paypal and obtained a list of 5,000 people who had subscribed to these sites . The priority was of course getting at those who ran the sites , but the subscribers were n't off the hook . One of the e-mail addresses that had purchased access to the Sick Child Room was Travelerva88@yahoo.com . Investigators served an administrative subpoena to Yahoo , which turned over subscriber information for the account . It belonged to someone who also used the address caffertyj@gmail.com and who worked in London -- but who listed a Largo , Florida home address . The information from Yahoo also contained , surprisingly enough , a link to the user 's Facebook profile . <p> Putting Cafferty 's name to the account was n't particularly difficult after this . Investigators eventually realized that their target was a US government employee working as a Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point it was July 2011 , and the child porn purchases had happened 5+ years before . Investigators decided that , before pursuing Cafferty , they wanted to know if he was still involved in the CP scene . <p> The case went to Corey Monaghan , a detective in the Largo , Florida police department and a member of the FBI 's nationwide Innocent Images Task Force . On July 14 , 2011 , Monaghan contacted his colleagues at the FBI 's Innocent Images Operations Unit in Maryland and asked them to deploy an \" investigative tool \" to determine Cafferty 's continued interest in child porn . In initial court documents , all descriptions of the tool were redacted -- but the Smoking Gun got its hands on the unredacted original and published several key pages . <p> The FBI had set up its fake CP site for precisely this situation . When investigators had a lead on someone specific , they e-mailed the person with a custom password and the site URL . The strangely explicit front page discussion about the \" Child Pornography \" within made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were accessing . As Monaghan 's unredacted affidavit makes clear , \" nowhere on the website home page indicates sic any adult pornography or anything other than child pornography is available through this website . \" In reality , the site offered no child porn ; the video loading screen had been purpose-built to fail in such a way that visitors believed their Internet connections to be the culprits . <p> Soon after Cafferty 's visit to the site , the Innocent Images task force knew they had found their man . Not only had he used his custom password -- he had logged in with a London IP address . Time to pay him a visit . ",

The inability to overcome a language barrier or find transportation or a lack of knowledge of the modern world can make it difficult to find work . <p> City of Refuge , a not-for-profit organization that assists refugees from around the world , helps hundreds of families make it in the United States . <p> The population of refugees in Central Missouri , specifically Columbia , continues to increase as residents of troubled nations and territories seek asylum in the United States . Although it remains unknown exactly how many refugees are residing in Central Missouri , Refugee and Immigration Services of the Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City is believed to be responsible for the majority of local immigration , Wheeler said . <p> Since 1975 , the agency has assisted people from Asia , Africa , Eastern Europe and Latin America find their way to Central Missouri . The diocese pays rent for refugee families for the first six months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of paid utilities also are provided . <p> It 's not until grant funding is depleted that the newcomers are in some ways on their own in a great big new world . <p> Through City of Refuge , Wheeler said she tries her best to provide people with the resources they need . That means transportation to doctors appointments , English classes , clothing , food and , most important , work . <p> ? <p> Started in September 2010 , City of Refuge was organized in response to the generosity of others and success of a small cleaning service Wheeler created called Safi-Sana LLC . The organization 's origins , however , date back to January 2009 , when Wheeler and her husband , Adam Wheeler , a local pediatrician , were attending a Christian Fellowship Church service . <p> About 50 East African immigrants often attended services , but Wheeler said she feared to approach them . <p> \" I used to be afraid to speak to people who did n't speak English , \" she said . \" I knew they were there . What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the refugees feel at home , so a group of refugees ages 15 to 25 attended dinner one night for Bible study . Lucky to have a trio of French interpreters , Wheeler said she made a connection with her new friends and recognized their needs . <p> \" They have never seen spaghetti or tacos , \" she said . \" Everything we made we had to show them how to eat it . ... I got that burden that night . \" <p> Wheeler said she became fascinated with the stories some would tell and the way they lived their lives . Raised in Florissant , she recalls her middle-class lifestyle and the \" very white neighborhood \" she grew up in to be foreign from the obstacles these newcomers face . <p> ? <p> People come to the United States for many reasons . Some Iraqi refugees have been relocated to Columbia because they assisted the American government and its troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom .

He now takes other refugees to doctor , dentist and other appointments , sometimes as far as Kansas City and St. Louis . <p> \" They tell me to do stuff , but I do n't understand , \" he said of his first jobs . <p> Rusaya finds more dignity in driving than cleaning work .

He did so when a higher-paying job came along , and Cing now works as a stay-at-home mom . <p> \" I can feed three families here , \" he said of sending money back to both his and Cing 's parents . <p> Here in Columbia , Pau said , life is much better than in Burma .

On any given day this year , the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement has been caring for more than 2,100 unaccompanied child immigrants . <p> The influx came to light last week when 100 kids were taken to Lackland AFB for temporary housing . It was the first time the government has turned to the Defense Department -- now , 200 boys and girls younger than 18 stay in a base dormitory . <p> While the issue of unaccompanied minors arriving in the U.S. is n't new , the scale of the recent increase is . From October 2011 through March , 5,252 kids landed in U.S. custody without a parent or guardian -- a 93 percent increase from the same period the previous year , according to data released by the Department of Health and Human Services . In March alone , 1,390 kids arrived . <p> The cause of the surge remains a mystery to child migrant advocates and government officials . The kids are coming from the same places as usual -- Guatemala , El Salvador , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explanations : they made the trek to look for parents already in the U.S. ; they 're seeking economic opportunity to send money home ; they want to escape violence or abuse . <p> \" We 're talking to the children , but we do n't have one solid answer , \" said Lauren Fisher of the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project , which helps children and their families navigate the system . \" There seem to be the same reasons that we 've seen before . \" <p> Some have suggested that human smugglers are more aggressively marketing their services . Others wonder if the Border Patrol , whose presence has doubled in recent years , is simply catching more of them . But Border Patrol apprehensions of children and adults were cut in half from 2008 to 2011 , and only 5 percent of those caught are unaccompanied children . Younger children commonly cross with adult smugglers at the ports of entry , while older kids join groups that follow guides through the brush . <p> A South Texas woman told border authorities this month that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hidalgo , Texas , and Reynosa , Mexico , was her sister , according to court records . She even presented a Texas birth certificate . But the girl could n't answer basic questions , so the woman told customs officers that she was n't related to the girl at all . She said that a man whom she worked with in Mexico offered her $2,000 to \" cross \" the girl -- who was actually from Guatemala -- and accompany her to Houston . The woman was charged with transporting an illegal immigrant . <p> Last week , the first ladies of Mexico , Honduras and Guatemala spoke at a three-day conference on unaccompanied minors in Washington , D.C. Mexico 's first lady , Margarita Zavala , and Honduras ' Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo noted that tougher U.S. border security made it more difficult for parents working in the U.S. to return for their children , a suggestion as to why parents increasingly would put their children in a smuggler 's care . <p> \" The statistics are worrisome , \" said Rosa Maria Leal de Perez , Guatemala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children repatriated in the last year . \" <p> Child welfare groups are in \" triage mode , \" said Wendy Young , executive director of Kids in Need of Defense , a Washington , D.C.-based nonprofit that matches pro bono attorneys with unaccompanied minors navigating the immigration system . \" It 's important that the resources and the capacity meet the need , and we 're not quite there yet . \" <p> The Department of Health and Human Services ' Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities in 10 states range from shelters to foster homes and have about 2,500 beds . Government-contracted shelters were maxing out their emergency bed space , setting up cots in gymnasiums and other extra spaces . <p> \" It 's a much more limited set of services , \" Fisher said . \" It felt something like a Red Cross shelter , a hurricane shelter . \" <p> Unaccompanied children are first processed by the Department of Homeland Security , then turned over to the ORR while the deportation process begins . Once in a shelter , the search begins for relatives or an acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pro bono attorneys . When a custodian is found , the child can leave the shelter and await immigration proceedings . <p> Eighty percent of the children referred to the ORR end up in a shelter , according to a report released last month by the Vera Institute of Justice -- a nonprofit that developed a program to better provide access to legal services for children . The average shelter stay is 61 days . <p> At the Lackland shelter , HHS spokesman Jesse Garcia said the goal is to move kids to more establishe accommodations within 15 days . <p> \" We are looking to add some educational features that are appropriate for a 30-day temporary program , \" Garcia said . <p> As of late Friday , 83 children had already been transferred out of Lackland , most to permanent facilities . Nineteen had been reunited with family . ",

they 're seeking economic opportunity to send money home ; they want to escape violence or abuse . <p> \" we 're talking to the children , but we do n't have one solid answer , \" said lauren fisher of the south texas pro bono asylum representation project , which helps children and their families navigate the system . \" there seem to be the same reasons that we 've seen before . \" <p> some have suggested that human smugglers are more aggressively marketing their services . others wonder if the border patrol , whose presence has doubled in recent years , is simply catching more of them . but border patrol apprehensions of children and adults were cut in half from 2008 to 2011 , and only 5 percent of those caught are unaccompanied children . younger children commonly cross with adult smugglers at the ports of entry , while older kids join groups that follow guides through the brush . <p> a south texas woman told border authorities this month that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidalgo , texas , and reynosa , mexico , was her sister , according to court records . she even presented a texas birth certificate . but the girl could n't answer basic questions , so the woman told customs officers that she was n't related to the girl at all . she said that a man whom she worked with in mexico offered her $2,000 to \" cross \" the girl -- who was actually from guatemala -- and accompany her to houston . the woman was charged with transporting an illegal immigrant . <p> last week , the first ladies of mexico , honduras and guatemala spoke at a three-day conference on unaccompanied minors in washington , d.c. mexico 's first lady , margarita zavala , and honduras ' rosa elena bonilla de lobo noted that tougher u.s. border security made it more difficult for parents working in the u.s. to return for their children , a suggestion as to why parents increasingly would put their children in a smuggler 's care . <p> \" the statistics are worrisome , \" said rosa maria leal de perez , guatemala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children repatriated in the last year . \" <p> child welfare groups are in \" triage mode , \" said wendy young , executive director of kids in need of defense , a washington , d.c.-based nonprofit that matches pro bono attorneys with unaccompanied minors navigating the immigration system . \" it 's important that the resources and the capacity meet the need , and we 're not quite there yet . \" <p> the department of health and human services ' office of refugee resettlement facilities in 10 states range from shelters to foster homes and have about 2,500 beds . government-contracted shelters were maxing out their emergency bed space , setting up cots in gymnasiums and other extra spaces . <p> \" it 's a much more limited set of services , \" fisher said . \" it felt something like a red cross shelter , a hurricane shelter . \" <p> unaccompanied children are first processed by the department of homeland security , then turned over to the orr while the deportation process begins . once in a shelter , the search begins for relatives or an acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pro bono attorneys . when a custodian is found , the child can leave the shelter and await immigration proceedings . <p> eighty percent of the children referred to the orr end up in a shelter , according to a report released last month by the vera institute of justice -- a nonprofit that developed a program to better provide access to legal services for children . the average shelter stay is 61 days . <p> at the lackland shelter , hhs spokesman jesse garcia said the goal is to move kids to more establishe accommodations within 15 days . <p> \" we are looking to add some educational features that are appropriate for a 30-day temporary program , \" garcia said . <p> as of late friday , 83 children had already been transferred out of lackland , most to permanent facilities . nineteen had been reunited with family .

        "title":"Khan accuses Jacksonville of violating lease, seeks swift resolution ...\n",
        "text":"<p> Jaguars owner Shahid Khan has been unequivocal regarding his desire to keep the team in Jacksonville . He has adopted the city as a home away from home . He has spent on free agents and he plans to spend on improving the team 's facilities . He has donated $1 million to a veteran 's guidance center . <p> And he 's now embroiled in a full-blown fight with City officials . <p> In a May 30 letter to Mayor Alvin Brown , obtained by the Jacksonville Business Journal , Khan accuses the City of violating the lease agreement that allows the franchise to play at Everbank Field . <p> The dispute arises from the fairly mundane task of hiring a manager for the facility . Khan contends that Section 2.5(E) of the lease requires the Jaguars to , upon reviewing the submitted proposals , make a recommendation to Jacksonville . City officials then will evaluate the proposals after the Jaguars make the recommendation . ( The City apparently believes that the two parties must converse about the situation before any recommendations are made . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that a lawyer representing Jacksonville then sent the team a letter declaring the franchise to be in default , and \" putting in motion a termination of our lease . \" <p> As we said , \" Uh . Oh . \" <p> \" The action of sending the default letter is unprecedented , \" Khan writes . \" The default mechanism of the lease has not been implemented in the 18 years the lease has been in effect . While we certainly take the default claim seriously , the only response we can make to your letter is to cure the claimed default . However , it is not possible to cure as we are in full compliance with the lease . <p> \" Mayor , I hope you can understand that I am shocked and perplexed at the City 's actions . I am at a loss to understand the purpose of this drastic and unprecedented action . I am hopeful that the letter is as a result of an overzealous lawyer and not the result of the philosophy of your administration in dealing with the partnership between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to comply exactly with our lease obligations . \" <p> Khan then requests Brown to \" advise us of the method of your implementation of the default and termination , if that is your intention . \" Khan adds , \" We are on the cusp of training camp to begin the NFL season and will need to act quickly . \" <p> Again : \" Uh . Oh . \" <p> The fact that Jacksonville is initiating the termination process seems very odd , unless Jacksonville perceives that it can derive a benefit that somehow outweighs the costs of possibly giving the team the ability to , you know , move . And it 's hard not to at least wonder whether Khan 's response is aimed to provoking a fight that eventually would give him the ability to , you know , move . <p> In the interim , we 'll track down a copy of the lease and try to make sense of who 's right and who 's wrong . There does n't seem to be much middle ground on this one -- either the Jaguars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . <p> It feels like something bigger is happening here , but it 's hard to imagine the lease disintegrating simply because the Jaguars recommended the hiring of a facilities manager . Even if the action constitutes a violation of the lease , it does n't seem like the kind of thing that could result in the lease imploding and the Jaguars relocating . <p> Just FYI -- My home away from home is a black Benz limo with a cellular phone . <p> patriotsdefense says:May 30 , 2012 6:27 PM <p> It is very odd indeed . <p> If the lease is broken by the team I know the city gets a huge lump sum of money . I think it 's $30 million . But that number could have gone up after that extension signed by Weaver the former owner . <p> This is very odd because secretly this is exactly what the team wants . Khan wanted to buy the Rams in STL . I think he 's going to get his wish to return to his home town of STL after the Rams return to LA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the city of Jacksonville give up any leverage of keeping an NFL team . The NFL will not return . Jaguars fans , pick the Falcons 300 miles north or the Bucs 170 southwest or the Dolphins 350 miles south . ( BHA ! and to think Florida said no thanks to high speed rail ) <p> The lawyer that sent the letter claiming the Jaguars had defaulted on the lease has promptly backtracked . <p> From the news4jax.com story : <p> \" When we received your letter dated May 24 , 2012 , that the Jacksonville Jaguars have selected SMG as the EverBank Field facility manager I was surprised , \" General Counsel Cindy Laquidara wroter in a letter Jaguars president Mark Lamping. \" until this afternoon , I was unaware of the change to the RFP agreed to by Ms. Chastain in contravention to my April 30 , 2012 , letter to Mr. Brown . \" <p> \" Please consider this my withdrawal of that default , \" Laquidara wrote . \" Given the long-standing positive relationship between the Jaguars and the City and new information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misunderstanding on this matter , I hereby withdraw any notice of default . It would be more productive for representatives from the Jaguars and the City to meet and see if we can resolve any concerns that either party has . \" <p> tfbuckfutter says:May 30 , 2012 6:31 PM <p> Is the mayor of Jacksonville James Bond ? <p> Because he is the only man who could get away with crossing someone sporting that mustache . <p> Sounds suspicious since no way Jags could up and leave for LA this year with no place to play and no arrangements made otherwise . Waiting for more info , or if we got it already thanks to Charles Fenwick above , then its just another PFT gag , oh wait , ' report ' because after all these are ' journalists ' . Right . <p> This is very odd because secretly this is exactly what the team wants . Khan wanted to buy the Rams in STL . I think he 's going to get his wish to return to his home town of STL after the Rams return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <p> Except that the Rams are not moving to L.A. 1st off , should St.Louis actually terminate their lease with the Rams , they are not eligible to move until March 2015 .. which also happens to be the same time the builder of the new stadium said he would not wait til to get a new team . <p> Secondly , Raiders , Chargers , and Jags all are much higher in the running to move . <p> Thirdly -- The Rams offer to upgrade the stadium is not a ridiculious or absurd offer . It looks like a legit , practical offer and not one made out of desperation to move but really upgrade .

        "lower_text":"<p> jaguars owner shahid khan has been unequivocal regarding his desire to keep the team in jacksonville . he has adopted the city as a home away from home . he has spent on free agents and he plans to spend on improving the team 's facilities . he has donated $1 million to a veteran 's guidance center . <p> and he 's now embroiled in a full-blown fight with city officials . <p> in a may 30 letter to mayor alvin brown , obtained by the jacksonville business journal , khan accuses the city of violating the lease agreement that allows the franchise to play at everbank field . <p> the dispute arises from the fairly mundane task of hiring a manager for the facility . khan contends that section 2.5(e) of the lease requires the jaguars to , upon reviewing the submitted proposals , make a recommendation to jacksonville . city officials then will evaluate the proposals after the jaguars make the recommendation . ( the city apparently believes that the two parties must converse about the situation before any recommendations are made . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that a lawyer representing jacksonville then sent the team a letter declaring the franchise to be in default , and \" putting in motion a termination of our lease . \" <p> as we said , \" uh . oh . \" <p> \" the action of sending the default letter is unprecedented , \" khan writes . \" the default mechanism of the lease has not been implemented in the 18 years the lease has been in effect . while we certainly take the default claim seriously , the only response we can make to your letter is to cure the claimed default . however , it is not possible to cure as we are in full compliance with the lease . <p> \" mayor , i hope you can understand that i am shocked and perplexed at the city 's actions . i am at a loss to understand the purpose of this drastic and unprecedented action . i am hopeful that the letter is as a result of an overzealous lawyer and not the result of the philosophy of your administration in dealing with the partnership between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to comply exactly with our lease obligations . \" <p> khan then requests brown to \" advise us of the method of your implementation of the default and termination , if that is your intention . \" khan adds , \" we are on the cusp of training camp to begin the nfl season and will need to act quickly . \" <p> again : \" uh . oh . \" <p> the fact that jacksonville is initiating the termination process seems very odd , unless jacksonville perceives that it can derive a benefit that somehow outweighs the costs of possibly giving the team the ability to , you know , move . and it 's hard not to at least wonder whether khan 's response is aimed to provoking a fight that eventually would give him the ability to , you know , move . <p> in the interim , we 'll track down a copy of the lease and try to make sense of who 's right and who 's wrong . there does n't seem to be much middle ground on this one -- either the jaguars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . <p> it feels like something bigger is happening here , but it 's hard to imagine the lease disintegrating simply because the jaguars recommended the hiring of a facilities manager . even if the action constitutes a violation of the lease , it does n't seem like the kind of thing that could result in the lease imploding and the jaguars relocating . <p> just fyi -- my home away from home is a black benz limo with a cellular phone . <p> patriotsdefense says:may 30 , 2012 6:27 pm <p> it is very odd indeed . <p> if the lease is broken by the team i know the city gets a huge lump sum of money . i think it 's $30 million . but that number could have gone up after that extension signed by weaver the former owner . <p> this is very odd because secretly this is exactly what the team wants . khan wanted to buy the rams in stl . i think he 's going to get his wish to return to his home town of stl after the rams return to la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the city of jacksonville give up any leverage of keeping an nfl team . the nfl will not return . jaguars fans , pick the falcons 300 miles north or the bucs 170 southwest or the dolphins 350 miles south .

        "text":"<p> ( CNN ) Twenty five years ago , President Reagan gave a speech in West Berlin where he exhorted Mr. Gorbachev to \" tear down this wall . \" Two years later , the barbed wire and wall that was a symbol of oppression came crashing down , ending decades of tyranny and leading to one of the greatest expansions of freedom and liberty in the 20th Century . <p> America has its own Berlin Wall . It is called K-12 education . <p> As schools let out for summer vacation , far too many parents , particularly low-income parents , are trapped behind the wall of their zip code or family income . They have no real freedom to send their child to a school that works best for them , and far too often they are forced to attend woefully underperforming schools or schools that just do n't meet their child 's individual learning needs . <p> This can not go on . <p> Instead , we must tear down the Berlin Wall that holds back parents from being able to pick the school that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thankfully , in the last two years , education reform and school choice have become front and center in America . As Mitt Romney said last week , we must put an end to the millions of children in our nation who receive a \" third world education . \" And President Obama said , \" Michelle and I are here only because we were given a chance at an education . I will not settle for an America where some kids do n't have that chance . \" <p> The first step in tearing down the educational Berlin Wall is to give parents -- particularly low-income parents and parents of special needs students -- more freedom of choice . <p> Programs such as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program are lifesavers for thousands of children and are steps in the right direction . However , all kids should have access to quality educational options and no child should be excluded for arbitrary reasons that have nothing to do with an individual child 's needs . <p> Milton Friedman , the Nobel laureate economist and father of the school choice concept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give all parents the freedom to choose . The greater the potential for schools to lose customers , the more likely you will see schools improve . <p> Just like the millions of East Germans who demanded freedom , we know that there are millions of parents that want to be removed from a system that uses a zip code to determine where their children must attend school . They want more school choice . <p> Earlier this month , The Friedman Foundation released a poll by Braun Research , Inc. that showed 71 percent of Moms with school-aged children support school vouchers for all students ; only 30 percent of these Moms believed vouchers should be allocated based on financial need or disability . <p> We often hear from Moms that their children have unique circumstances that may require more individualized attention that can only be found in a private school . Moms seeking school choice sometimes want other options because their children may be in an unsafe environment . Or they may believe their public school may not share their cultural , social or spiritual values . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school just does n't perform well enough to address their child 's learning needs and thus , will negatively impact their child 's future academic success . <p> They are telling the education monopoly they want options . They do not want to be held behind the Berlin Wall of their zip code and told where their child must be sent to school . Moms and all voters are starting to tell educators they want options so children are n't destined to one track in life . <p> As Romney pointed out , a \" third world education \" is not uncommon in our nation . And when children receive such an education , they are more likely to be unemployed , on government assistance or in jail or in prison when they become adults . <p> Vouchers not only provide freedom , they offer the political , moral , ethical and economical high ground . <p> We say Moms know best . Vouchers should be made available to children no matter if they are poor , disabled , from the middle class or from a family of 10 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There should be no restrictions on who gets to choose , just like there were no restrictions on who could escape tyranny once the Berlin Wall fell . <p> The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Enlow. <h> soundoff ( 16 Responses ) <p> j young <p> I am all for vouchers . Why should parents have to send their children to schools that continually fail them ? I pulled my daughter from the public school system when she was in kindergarten . She had been diagnosed with learning disorders , including dyslexia and dysgraphia , and had spent the year with a teacher who ripped up papers and scribbled on her work with a red marker when my daughter would write things backwards . After doing the IEP , we were told that although she had learning problems , her intelligence testing scored too high to allow them to classify her as learning disabled , but they could classify her as ADHD ( NOT the problem ) and allow her to meet with a social worker once a month . We pulled her out and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is still struggles , but is working at grade level and gets A 's on all of her tests because the school was willing to provide accomodations that the public school simply would n't . We recently had her re-evaluated with the same results , and considered returning to the public school because tuition costs were so high , only to find that after reviewing all of the testing and the IEP , the school was n't still only willing to provide minimal assistance . I say bring on the vouchers . I 've seen the difference the right school and environment makes firsthand . Our children deserve more than an education . They deserve every opportunity for success that can be provided-and if the public schools ca n't do it , parents should have options . <p> June 6 , 2012 at 7:45 pm <p> Teri <p> Vouchers will not solve the problem because private and charter schools have a huge advantage that public schools do not have -- they can limit their size . They do n't have to take everybody or anybody that wants to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , we are full . \" or \" Sorry , we do n't provide the special services a child like yours needs -- you will have to take him\/her to another school . \" or even \" Your child is not a good fit for our school .

You will have to find another school for your child . \" <p> What will the government do when they issue a bunch of vouchers , but the charter and private schools are full ? Or when the charter and private schools wo n't take those students ? These schools run by their own rules . They can decide how many students they want in a classroom , they can decide what curriculum to use , they can decide if they want to provide extra resources for struggling students and they do not have to administer standarized test 's to ensure that their students are making adequet growth and progress . They can claim to be better than public schools , but unless their students take the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have taught in both public AND private schools . In my experience the public schools do a MUCH better job of helping struggling students . And , as an earlier post said -- these struggling students are the most expensive . Private and charter schools do n't want to spend the money to give these students the help they need -- but public schools are REQUIRED to . <p> Some students struggle because of learning disabilites that have nothing to do with their socioeconomic status or home life . But , many many students struggle because they are so disadvantaged . I have students with very very sad life stories . And yet , we take them , we do our best to overcome the huge obsticals to learning that their home life puts in our way . These parents wo n't even sign a homework folder or read at home to their kids ... do you really think they are going to apply for a voucher , research schools , and then drive them to school and pick them up every day ? <p> These \" experts \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom .

There 's no shame in getting the tools you need to be better at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the students to come to tutorials when they need help so why ca n't teachers set the example ? ? <p> It 's gotten so difficult in letting teachers go . Why ? ? Maybe we can learn something from Donald Trump -- You 're fired ! In the real world , if you 're not productive , you get a chance , maybe two and then you are let go . Why do we accept mediocrity when it comes to our children ? They are our most valuable asset . <p> And the parents . Well , being in the best schools because they can meet your child 's needs better is n't going to help if you do n't do your job as a parent . You still have to take time with your child . The schools and the teachers ca n't do it all . Parents do n't want to parent , and in defense of some , they do n't know how and leave everything to the schools . Well , why do n't you just sign over custody papers to the school while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's challenging and time-consuming , but it 's worth it ! <p> Let 's all try to do our jobs , whether we 're parents , teachers , or politicians and let us not forget those we work for -- the children ! <p> June 1 , 2012 at 1:15 am <p> Aaron <p> \" In a system like this -- dubbed \" educational apartheid \" by one Chilean professor -- only students from wealthier families can afford to access quality education , while all others must take out expensive educational loans , saddling them with enormous debt \" <p> Milton Friedman 's philosophy led to the military dictatorships that killed 1000 's of people in the Southern Cone of South America . Pure evil . In fact Pinochet targeted educators . How ironic . <p> Let the local community reform the schools . Get rid of all of the bureaucracy and mandates .

A Congress with the lowest approval rating ever should not be reforming our public schools . <p> Chile 's voucher system is a disaster and do n't trust anyone from the Friedman Foundation . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 11:48 am <p> Melissa <p> Vouchers are fine ... as long as the receiving schools are also held to the same standards as public schools .

But the millions of children whose choice of school is based solely on location , will suffer greatly . Low income neighborhoods do n't have schools that parent from high socioeconomic backgrounds will send their children to . These schools will be underfunded causing lower socioeconomic familes to receive a sub par education . The education system is suppose to help end the cycle of poverty , the voucher sysytem will act as a catalyst . <p> May 30 , 2012 at 6:13 pm <p> Eric Andersen <p> Romney used the latest PISA scores to say that our students are getting a third-world education . When US schools are broken out by poverty level and compared to other countries with similar poverty levels the US is in first place in every poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we educate all of our children unlike most other countries . Comparing apples to apples the US has the by far the best K-12 public education system in the world . Can we improve ? Of course we can . This Repub claim that US public education system is broken is an outright lie . How can it be broken when we are doing a better job than every other country in the world ? Do we spend more per pupil on education than most other countries ? Yes we do . What group of students are the most expensive to educate ? The bottom 25% . The very same bottom 25% that most other countries do not educate and do not include in their statistics . <p> May 30 , 2012 at 1:30 pm <p> Skeptic <p> Please cite your sources sir . As an educational researcher I can tell you that your points are not true . We are outperformed when comparing apples to apples . There are districts in both China and several of the Nordic countries that greatly outperform even a subsample of our students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have a statistical impact on our scores , it is not a completely moderating effect . It is simply an excuse given when somebody does not tear into the statistics for themselves . You can also pull some of our top performing middle and high schools in the nation out of the data set , and they do not compare to top districts in some of the other locations of the world . If you have other information , please cite it . <p> Your article compared Finland 's and other OECD countries poverty rate to the US . Actually before social transfers Finland 's poverty rate is similar to United States but after social transfers it drops dramatically . Can I assume from your citation that you wish lower the poverty rate in the United States ? Maybe that will help our kids perform better . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 2:46 am <p> Eric Andersen <p> Lowering the poverty rate would be great but it is not the point of my post . The point of my post is that it is not that US public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing education to students who live in ' third-world ' poverty . As the linked article states one of the very few linear relationships that exist in these statistics is the poverty\/academic achievement relationship . The US is doing a better job of educating students , despite their poverty , than any other country in the world . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 1:40 pm <p> ChristyG <p> As a teacher , what do we do with failing students ? We enroll them in special education programs . We get them tutors . We provide as many supports as we can to get them to pass , and hopefully graduate , or at least get a GED so that they can be participating members of society and function at their best . We nurture them and encourage them to focus on positive things and push them to their fullest potential , even if it is only a \" C Average \" . All so that they can have a good life once they leave the school environment . <p> As a government , what do we do with failing schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We cut funding based on under-performance with students from families that have little or no income and ca n't read to their children every night to support their education . We give teachers \" merit pay \" or fire them based on test scores that they really have little control over ! We cut , cut , cut ! If we did that to failing students , would there not be outrage ? ! If we decided that students who fail should just be cut out of school ? ! <p> Why is it okay to have current educational trends be moving toward Positive Behavioral and Academic Support , but our government concentrating on all negatives ! As public school employees , we are trying so hard to focus on what kids do well and recognize them for it to encourage those positive things and NOT focus on the negatives . Yes , government , let 's put in Merit pay and focus on the who is \" the best \" , while creating a resentful and non-cooperative environment among teachers . Let 's cut away at everything our \" neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What good is having the choice when the nearest school that you \" choose \" is miles away ! Especially when you may have a perfectly good school right down the street that people who have never taught a day in their life deem as unfit or under-performing ! I challenge any government official that is making decisions for the fate of public education to step into a classroom for a day ; to do the job of a teacher for just a little while and to be held accountable for those kids that eat all of their meals for the day at that neighborhood school ! Those kids that were up all night taking care of their siblings because there are no functioning adults in the household ! Those kids at age 10 that know more about the streets than most adults know ! <p> Please , let 's focus on what schools do well ! Let 's support our schools that need help ! Let 's make sure that our neighborhood schools can function so that the family that does n't own a vehicle does n't have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's do what our schools are doing and create positive rewards and supports for all who may need support and encouragement to do better ! Let 's foster an environment of cooperation and ingenuity to make sure we can work with what we have , even if it 's not much ! Teachers are fabulous people ! They work wonders with what they are given and they touch lives forever ! They turn kids into Presidents , CEO 's , Mothers , Fathers , Forbes 500 names , celebrities even ! Let 's appreciate them ! ! ! ! Let 's fund our schools and make each school a wonderful place to learn ! Time to focus on the positive , people ! <p> May 30 , 2012 at 9:21 am <p> JEM <p> Do a Google search for \" Ball Tapping \" , \" Dropout Factory \" or \" Bullying \" and one might conclude that our public schools do n't do much of anything well accept train kids for careers as prison inmates . <p> May 31 , 2012 at 2:24 pm <p> Aaron <p> The Friedman Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail system is happening . Bottom line is , you need people in jail to profit . America 's culture will always produce inmates . <p> Bottom line for profit is an out of control evil in this country .

        "lower_text":"<p> ( cnn ) twenty five years ago , president reagan gave a speech in west berlin where he exhorted mr. gorbachev to \" tear down this wall . \" two years later , the barbed wire and wall that was a symbol of oppression came crashing down , ending decades of tyranny and leading to one of the greatest expansions of freedom and liberty in the 20th century . <p> america has its own berlin wall . it is called k-12 education . <p> as schools let out for summer vacation , far too many parents , particularly low-income parents , are trapped behind the wall of their zip code or family income . they have no real freedom to send their child to a school that works best for them , and far too often they are forced to attend woefully underperforming schools or schools that just do n't meet their child 's individual learning needs . <p> this can not go on . <p> instead , we must tear down the berlin wall that holds back parents from being able to pick the school that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankfully , in the last two years , education reform and school choice have become front and center in america . as mitt romney said last week , we must put an end to the millions of children in our nation who receive a \" third world education . \" and president obama said , \" michelle and i are here only because we were given a chance at an education . i will not settle for an america where some kids do n't have that chance . \" <p> the first step in tearing down the educational berlin wall is to give parents -- particularly low-income parents and parents of special needs students -- more freedom of choice . <p> programs such as the d.c. opportunity scholarship program are lifesavers for thousands of children and are steps in the right direction . however , all kids should have access to quality educational options and no child should be excluded for arbitrary reasons that have nothing to do with an individual child 's needs . <p> milton friedman , the nobel laureate economist and father of the school choice concept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give all parents the freedom to choose . the greater the potential for schools to lose customers , the more likely you will see schools improve . <p> just like the millions of east germans who demanded freedom , we know that there are millions of parents that want to be removed from a system that uses a zip code to determine where their children must attend school . they want more school choice . <p> earlier this month , the friedman foundation released a poll by braun research , inc. that showed 71 percent of moms with school-aged children support school vouchers for all students ; only 30 percent of these moms believed vouchers should be allocated based on financial need or disability . <p> we often hear from moms that their children have unique circumstances that may require more individualized attention that can only be found in a private school . moms seeking school choice sometimes want other options because their children may be in an unsafe environment . or they may believe their public school may not share their cultural , social or spiritual values . or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school just does n't perform well enough to address their child 's learning needs and thus , will negatively impact their child 's future academic success . <p> they are telling the education monopoly they want options . they do not want to be held behind the berlin wall of their zip code and told where their child must be sent to school . moms and all voters are starting to tell educators they want options so children are n't destined to one track in life . <p> as romney pointed out , a \" third world education \" is not uncommon in our nation . and when children receive such an education , they are more likely to be unemployed , on government assistance or in jail or in prison when they become adults . <p> vouchers not only provide freedom , they offer the political , moral , ethical and economical high ground . <p> we say moms know best . vouchers should be made available to children no matter if they are poor , disabled , from the middle class or from a family of 10 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be no restrictions on who gets to choose , just like there were no restrictions on who could escape tyranny once the berlin wall fell . <p> the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of robert enlow. <h> soundoff ( 16 responses ) <p> j young <p> i am all for vouchers . why should parents have to send their children to schools that continually fail them ?

! if we decided that students who fail should just be cut out of school ? ! <p> why is it okay to have current educational trends be moving toward positive behavioral and academic support , but our government concentrating on all negatives ! as public school employees , we are trying so hard to focus on what kids do well and recognize them for it to encourage those positive things and not focus on the negatives . yes , government , let 's put in merit pay and focus on the who is \" the best \" , while creating a resentful and non-cooperative environment among teachers . let 's cut away at everything our \" neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what good is having the choice when the nearest school that you \" choose \" is miles away ! especially when you may have a perfectly good school right down the street that people who have never taught a day in their life deem as unfit or under-performing ! i challenge any government official that is making decisions for the fate of public education to step into a classroom for a day ; to do the job of a teacher for just a little while and to be held accountable for those kids that eat all of their meals for the day at that neighborhood school ! those kids that were up all night taking care of their siblings because there are no functioning adults in the household ! those kids at age 10 that know more about the streets than most adults know ! <p> please , let 's focus on what schools do well ! let 's support our schools that need help ! let 's make sure that our neighborhood schools can function so that the family that does n't own a vehicle does n't have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's do what our schools are doing and create positive rewards and supports for all who may need support and encouragement to do better ! let 's foster an environment of cooperation and ingenuity to make sure we can work with what we have , even if it 's not much ! teachers are fabulous people ! they work wonders with what they are given and they touch lives forever ! they turn kids into presidents , ceo 's , mothers , fathers , forbes 500 names , celebrities even ! let 's appreciate them ! ! ! ! let 's fund our schools and make each school a wonderful place to learn ! time to focus on the positive , people ! <p> may 30 , 2012 at 9:21 am <p> jem <p> do a google search for \" ball tapping \" , \" dropout factory \" or \" bullying \" and one might conclude that our public schools do n't do much of anything well accept train kids for careers as prison inmates . <p> may 31 , 2012 at 2:24 pm <p> aaron <p> the friedman foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail system is happening . bottom line is , you need people in jail to profit . america 's culture will always produce inmates . <p> bottom line for profit is an out of control evil in this country . from destroying our environment to creating resentment abroad , this country is in a downward spiral . as mitt and our rogue supreme court says \" corporations are people . \" liberty , after all is only for the aristocrats . corporations have the liberty to oppress the masses . vouchers would do the same . my community should be able to reform the schools in my districts . not some bum from d.c. or some for-profit company . <h> about this blog : <p> cnn 's schools of thought blog is a place for parents , educators and students to learn about and discuss what 's happening in education . we 're curious about what 's happening before kindergarten , through college and beyond . have a story to tell ?

Of course , teens are a lot more likely to become moms in some states than in others . Which state has the highest teen birth rate ? Keep clicking find out - and see 14 states that were n't far behind ... <p> ( CBS News ) A pregnant Dominican Republic teenager who was at the center of the country 's abortion debate passed away on Friday . <p> Dr. Antonio Cabrera , the legal representative for Semma Hospital in Santo Domingo , told CNN that the 16-year-old teenager died from complications from acute leukemia . She is not being named for privacy reasons . <p> The girl -- nicknamed Esperanza by the local media -- was nine weeks pregnant when she was diagnosed with the disease , CNN reported . Unfortunately , the life-saving chemotherapy she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anti-abortion law Article 37 of the Dominican Republic constitution .

She then suffered a miscarriage at 13 weeks on Friday and went into cardiac arrest , and doctors were not able to revive her . <p> \" They have killed me , I 'm dead , dead .

        "text":"<p> IMAGE : This is the American Journal of Botany August 2012 cover . The issue contains the article \" Ontologies as integrative tools for plant science \" by Ramona Walls et al . view more <p> Credit : Cindy Q. Tang <p> Botany is plagued by the same problem as the rest of science and society : our ability to generate data quickly and cheaply is surpassing our ability to access and analyze it . In this age of big data , scientists facing too much information rely on computers to search large data sets for patterns that are beyond the capability of humans to recognize--but computers can only interpret data based on the strict set of rules in their programming . <p> New tools called ontologies provide the rules computers need to transform information into knowledge , by attaching meaning to data , thereby making those data retrievable by computers and more understandable to human beings . Ontology , from the Greek word for the study of being or existence , traditionally falls within the purview of philosophy , but the term is now used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge in a consistent fashion . An ontology in this contemporary sense is a description of the types of entities within a given domain and the relationships among them . <p> A new article in this month 's American Journal of Botany by Ramona Walls ( New York Botanical Garden ) and colleagues describes how scientists build ontologies such as the Plant Ontology ( PO ) and how these tools can transform plant science by facilitating new ways of gathering and exploring data . <p> When data from many divergent sources , such as data about some specific plant organ , are associated or \" tagged \" with particular terms from a single ontology or set of interrelated ontologies , the data become easier to find , and computers can use the logical relationships in the ontologies to correctly combine the information from the different databases . Moreover , computers can also use ontologies to aggregate data associated with the different subclasses or parts of entities . <p> For example , suppose a researcher is searching online for all examples of gene expression in a leaf . Any botanist performing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and midribs or in a frond . However , a search engine would not know that it needs to include these terms in its search--unless it was told that a frond is a type of leaf , and that every petiole and every midrib are parts of some leaf . It is this information that ontologies provide . <p> The article in the American Journal of Botany by Walls and colleagues describes what ontologies are , why they are relevant to plant science , and some of the basic principles of ontology development . It includes an overview of the ontologies that are relevant to botany , with a more detailed description of the PO and the challenges of building an ontology that covers all green plants . The article also describes four keys areas of plant science that could benefit from the use of ontologies : ( 1 ) comparative genetics , genomics , phenomics , and development ; ( 2 ) taxonomy and systematics ; ( 3 ) semantic applications ; and ( 4 ) education . Although most of the examples in this article are drawn from plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisms , and the article should be of interest to zoologists as well . <p> As genomic and phenomic data become available for more species , many different research groups are embarking on the annotation of their data and images with ontology terms . At the same time , cross-species queries are becoming more common , causing more researchers in plant science to turn to ontologies . Ontology developers are working with the scientists who generate data to make sure ontologies accurately reflect current science , and with database developers and publishers to find ways to make it easier for scientist to associate their data with ontologies . <p> ### <p> Walls , Ramona L. , Balaji Athreya , Laurel Cooper , Justin Elser , Maria A.

But in rare cases , hiccups have lasted longer -- and have even been signifiers of a more serious health issue . One patient hiccuped continually for 60 years , according to \" Today . \" A man who claimed to have hiccuped for three years straight was found to have a tumor pinching nerves that controlled his breathing , the Sun reported . And earlier this year , a man with a nonstop case of the hiccups was found to have actually suffered a small heart attack . <p> You likely have your own favorite method for getting rid of the hiccups when you really just ca n't wait them out . You probably even have a remedy you swear works 100 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's really only anecdotal evidence that any of these methods truly works . We asked Brian Udermann , Ph.D. , an exercise and sports science professor at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse and the author of \" 25 Ways to Cure the Hiccups : Uncovering the Truth Behind 101 Common Myths and Misconceptions \" to take a few guesses . <p> Close <p> ? <p> Get Rid Of Hiccups <p> of <p> ? <p> ? <p> There are seemingly endless hiccup remedies that involve some sort of alternate breathing method , from holding your breath to taking deep breaths to holding your breath while plugging your ears . \" Anything you do in regard to your breath , it 's possible that you could disrupt that nerve impulse from the brain to the diaphragm so you stop the hiccups , \" says Udermann . A little extra carbon dioxide may also help to relax the diaphragm , according to Dr. Oz , although we do n't know exactly why . Flickr photo by Camera on autopilot <p> There may be even more claims of water-based ways to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many we 've heard : Drink from the opposite side of the glass , drink through a straw ( with and without plugging your ears ) , drink through a napkin or towel and drink a big glass of water without stopping . Swallowing -- which , when you think about it , is a temporary change in your breathing , says Udermann -- may override those diaphragm spasms , according to Reader 's Digest Canada . \" It does n't matter if you drink upside down or sideways or from a spoon , \" says Udermann . \" It 's that act that could be disruptive . \" Flickr photo by eschipul <p> \" What works in our house is a teaspoon of sugar , \" says Udermann . \" You eat it , and they 're gone , 99 percent of the time . \" Others swear by a spoonful of peanut butter or ice cream . We 've even heard biting into a slice of lemon coated in sugar and bitters can do the trick . But there 's not likely anything specific about the peanut butter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like with drinking and breathing tricks , eating has the potential to affect your breath and therefore your diaphragm , says Udermann . We ca n't help but remind you though that that spoonful of sugar is just that , a spoon full of sugar , and it counts , calorically . Women should aim to eat fewer than 5 teaspoons of sugar a day , men 9 and kids about 3 , so you might want to try other remedies first ! <p> When you stick out or even pull on your tongue , you stimulate a part of the throat connected to the nasal passage called the nasopharynx and the opening between the vocal cords , which may offer some relief . Flickr photo by xlordashx <p> A little scare could work for two reasons . First of all , it 's likely to change your breathing cycle -- hear that gasp you just made ?

        "text":"<h> About the Coverwall <p> From John and Yoko to Miley Cyrus , Annie Leibovitz to David LaChapelle , the cover of Rolling Stone has always been an art form in its own right . Now you can explore all our covers , and read full articles from classic issues dating back to our 1967 launch in our brand-new Cover Wall . Explore the Coverwall ? <p> After four decades and 30 million albums sold , Ann and Nancy Wilson have decided to tell their story . This week Kicking &amp; Dreaming : A Story of Heart , Soul and Rock &amp; Roll ( HarperCollins ) hits shelves . With co-author Charles Cross ( Heavier Than Heaven : A Biography of Kurt Cobain ) , the Wilson sisters dish on Heart 's formative years , the inspirations behind their hits and their personal travails , along with some sordid rock gossip . Here are some of the more notable -- and curious -- stories revealed : <p> During Ann 's junior year in high school , their parents became aware that their daughters were regularly smoking pot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night after dinner , the Wilson parents suggested that the whole family toke together . Ann recalls it being rather embarrassing : \" It was n't the best pot , but I was n't about to share my connection with my parents . \" <p> \" Crazy On You \" was inspired by Ann 's first serious romance , with Michael Fischer , who would soon become Heart 's iron-fisted manager . The pair shacked up on a hippie commune in Canada . Wilson writes that while the lyrics \" were straight out of the scenes of wild sexuality that went on in the cottage , \" they were also about her feminist awakening and finding empowerment through her music . <p> During Heart 's earliest incarnation they were primarily a cover band , cementing their reputation in the Vancouver club scene with their set of Led Zeppelin songs . In March 1975 , Heart was onstage performing \" Stairway to Heaven \" when Zeppelin themselves walked in , fresh from their show at the Pacific Coliseum . Wilson writes that the foursome seemed oblivious , disappearing into the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" his doctor \" before promptly passing out . <p> When Nancy was on location with her then-husband ( and former Rolling Stone scribe ) Cameron Crowe while he was directing the 2001 bomb Vanilla Sky , the film 's star , Tom Cruise , gave the couple a personally guided tour of Scientology 's Celebrity Centre . <p> The early radio success of \" Magic Man \" was paid for with hookers and cocaine . The band 's publicist would ferry the Wilson sisters to radio appearances where they would meet the DJ , do a station ID and then be told to go wait outside . According to Nancy , \" When we were out of the way , he 'd pass the DJ a gram of cocaine or the number of a hooker he 'd lined up and say ' She 's yours , on Heart . ' It was n't until years later that the Wilson sisters found out about the shady dealings that had gone on behind their backs . <p> The photo negative for a topless picture of Ann Wilson , taken surreptitiously by Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a shoot with the photographer for the band 's Bebe Le Strange-era Rolling Stone cover went south , the band demanded the famed rock photographer destroy her copy ; when she refused , Heart took her to court . The judge ordered the negative to be kept in a safe deposit box that could only be opened with two keys -- one belonging to Wilson and the other to Leibovitz -- insuring it would never see the light of day . <p> In the fall of 1982 , Heart had a brush with the legendary ego of John Cougar Mellencamp . The young singer was opening the band 's tour behind Private Audition , Heart 's first album that was n't an immediate million-seller , when Mellencamp 's \" Jack and Diane \" went to number one . He came to the band with a proposition : \" Seeing as your album is a turkey and mine is a hit , care to swap places ? \" The Wilson sisters declined , reminding him that the tour had sold out before he 'd even been announced as the opening act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alex and Eddie , in their own fumbling , wasted way , suggested a four-way-of-sorts between them . The sisters declined , but later that night , when Nancy learned that Eddie did n't own an acoustic guitar she was incredulous , and she gave him one of her own before sending him on his way . The next morning , after a night-long binge , he called her hotel room and serenaded her over the phone . ",

        "text":"<p> If you 're reading this now , there 's great chance that you spend far too many of your waking hours looking at pictures of cars online . Which means you 've probably noticed that many of those images have their license tags obscured in some way . Being the inquisitive ( likely ) mammal that you are , you 've probably wondered why the license plate is obscured , and if it 's actually a good idea . <p> At least , I fit that description . Here at Jalopnik , we have n't had a policy to obscure license plate images -- I left them intact in , say , my Classicreviews -- but it 's worth investigating this further . <p> Some cars are so beautiful that it hits you like a canned ham fired from a cannon . The original ...

Why should it matter if they 're in a picture , when they 're normally not hidden , anyway ? <p> A note to Craigslist photographers : If you 're using an entire person in lieu of Scotch tape to ... Read more Read more <p> In the interest of full disclosure , I 'll reveal my thoughts coming into this . I was firmly in the **36;0;TOOLONG camp . To such a degree that I have a pair of Vans with my Beetle 's license plate number embroidered on the back . Also , it helps that I 'm so irritating that I 'm almost kidnap-proof , even if someone could find out where I lived from my car 's tags . But , I do have a wife and son far less annoying than myself , so I better get to the bottom of this . <p> A simple Google search reveals plenty of sites that offer ways to find out information based on license plate numbers . Hell , even our Gawk-bro site LifeHacker did an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to track down a bad driver or someone who keeps leaving their car ... Read more Read more <p> But that 's the internet -- I wanted the advice of someone who 's job it is to actually know what 's what with this stuff , and , ideally , have a uniform . So I called Officer Mosqueda of the California Highway Patrol and asked him , flat out , what information can people get from a license plate , and , as a CHP officer , would you suggest obscuring the plate ? <p> The truth is you can find out a lot from someone 's license tags . Officer Mosqueda said that there are both legal and illegal ways to find a person 's name , address , the registration and fee history of the car , and more . All this information can be made available to anyone , either through the DMV or through paid services , many of which are online . <p> For example , in California , to go through the DMV , one would fill out an INF 70 form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate number . The form does list a set of permissible uses , such as driver safety , theft , hiring commercial drivers , etc. but if someone 's the sort of perv that wants a person 's license information so they can masturbate outside their bedroom window , I do n't think they 'd have much issue lying on the form . <p> This method is still an improvement over how it used to be . Prior to 1994 , it was easier to get home addresses from DMV records , and this was the method by which the man who murdered Rebecca Schaeffer , an actress from the 90s television show My Sister Sam , got her home address and related information . This murder led to the creation of the Drivers ' Privacy Protection Act of 1994 . <p> Private , paid services do n't even care if you 're a creepy murderer or not -- they just take your money and send you the information . Now , this information is n't your blood type and a list of your deepest , most secretest fears , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As for the argument that your plate is already visible to anyone walking by your car , that 's certainly true . It 's just that the internet can so vastly expand the number of people able to see your license plate that it may become an issue . Still , as Officer Mosqueda told me with a certain degree of poetry , \" You ca n't blur out real life . \" Sage words , Officer . <p> Officer Mosqueda 's final advice ? You may as well obscure your license plate , just to be safe . His attitude was that while it 's not likely the information would be found and misused , it could happen . <p> So , I 'm proposing a couple of little rules that I plan to live by , and will suggest that these be made Jalopnik policy : <p> * If you take a picture of a car that is not yours , and you have not made any arrangements with the owner , then it is the photographer 's responsibility to obscure the plates . <p> * If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are placing your car in a situation or location where it can be reasonably expected that it will be photographed ( at a car show , on the set of a film shoot , etc. ) then it is the owner 's responsibility to obscure the license plates if desired , by physical means or electronic in the case of an owner-created photo . <p> Oh , and if the license plate in question is a really funny or ironic personalized plate , or an inadvertently dirty one , I reserve the right to ignore all these good rules . Because a penis joke on a license plate or something trumps all laws . ",

        "title":"A Horrifying Account Of 9\/11 From A Doctor Whose Husband Was In ...\n",
        "text":"<p> This is a guest post written by Michael 's wife about her experience working as a doctor at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital on September 11 , 2001 . They cleared the hospital and waited all day for injured victims to show up , but nobody did . She wrote this about two weeks later . ( See Michael 's 9\/11 diary here . ) <p> At first it was a fire . <p> From the patient lounge on the AIDS\/Tuberculosis ward of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital , the prison guard who was there to guard my incarcerated patient announced , somewhat casually , \" Hey , one of the twin towers is on fire . \" We all looked up , puzzled . One of my co-interns asked \" which one ? \" , but could only remember that the one his mother worked in had the antenna . We went to the lounge to look at the TV , and there was the one with the antenna , a thick , concentrated stream of smoke streaming from a big hole about 3\/4 up . He went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , family , nurses , and doctors were now all standing in front of the television in the lounge , watching the plume of smoke . Some people went to the window , which , being at the top of a large hospital at the top of Manhattan , looks all the way downtown , past Central Park , the Chrysler Building , and the Empire State Building all the way to Wall Street and the Trade Center . In the mornings , after about an hour of work , I can see the sun rise and glint pink off the Twin Towers , and think , Mike 's down there . Tuesday was a clear day , and we had a great view . <p> I called Mike , who works on Wall Street , about ten blocks from the towers . He picks up the phone immediately and says \" We 're OK . \" News is starting to come in . It 's not a fire , it 's a bomb . Some people think it was a small plane that hit the tower . An accident ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one knows either . Mike is trying to email his clients , who work on the 85th floor of the burning building . I tell him I love him and we hang up . <p> I try to go back to my regular morning business . I find my med student . This morning I 'm going to teach him how to put in iv 's . I get the stuff together , and we start to set one up , using the bottom of a tissue box as our first iv-needing victim . Then there 's a collective gasp from the lounge . A plane just hit the second tower . More people rush to the window . We run to the television or the window where you can see both towers , smoke pouring from the top of them like blown-out birthday candles . My friend O -- , whose mother works in the tower with the antenna , looks pale . An announcement comes over the speakers calling all of the heads of department of the hospital to an emergency meeting . My resident shows up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain that it looks like two planes crashed into the World Trade Center . \" By mistake ? \" he says . \" I do n't think it 's an accident , \" I say . <p> Things start to happen very quickly . One of the second-year residents shows up to tell us that the hospital is in disaster mode . I am on call ; this means that I 'm going to be admitting people into the hospital today . I 'm told to expect to be busy for the next few days . All elective surgeries and procedures are cancelled , and the operating rooms will be open and ready for any injured . We should try to discharge as many people as possible from the hospital to leave more beds open for the wounded . Any extra doctors on non-critical services are being pulled to help triple-staff the emergency room . <p> Then I get paged by my brother-in-law . I call back and after two or three tries I get through . My sister-in-law , Kim , gets on the phone to find out if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was before the second plane hit . Kim says that Jim , Mike 's brother , really thinks that Mike should get out of downtown as soon as he can . She sounds scared . I try to call Mike 's office , but all the phones are down . In the meantime , I 'm trying to talk over my patients with my resident and find out if we can get any of our patients out of the hospital . We come up with a list of three people who can probably leave . Mike 's sister in Boston pages me . She wants to know if I 'm OK and if I have heard from Mike . I try to call Mike again . I get his co-worker , Nadia , who says that she ca n't find Mike , that she thinks he may have left the building . I feel like she just punched me in the stomach . <p> Then I 'm paged by the MAR ( medical admitting resident ) about my new admissions . They are trying to get as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the emergency room . She tells me about three new patients , all of whom are on the floor and waiting for me to see them ( usually you find out about patients you will be admitting long before they actually arrive to your care ) . One of them is coming out of the ICU because they need a bed but is still pretty sick . The MAR says I should try to check on him soon because he 's \" not that stable . \" That 's doctor-speak for dying more quickly than slowly . <p> We start rounds . My attending physicians seem relatively unaffected by the whole thing and we start rounds like it 's a regular day . Except for the fact that we can still hear people yelling news from the patient lounge , and the TV blaring with voices that we ca n't quite make out . For the next two hours , we sit in rounds , listening to patient presentations , and my attendings have an academic discussion about treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia . I do n't hear any of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mike left his office and no one has heard from him . And next to and towering over Mike 's subway stop is the World Trade Center . <p> I get paged again to Kim and Jim 's number . But all the hospital phones and cell phones are down . I go back to rounds , where the discussion continues . I get paged again , so I leave rounds and go down the hall to where there are pay phones . There are people in the hallway crying and a man on the phone next to me saying \" Its OK , its OK , its OK , \" into the receiver . I call Jim and Kim 's number and get their voicemail . I go back to rounds . Ten minutes later I leave rounds again , go back to the same payphone , and get their voicemail again . This time I leave a message , telling them to please have Mike page me if they hear from him . I tell them that I love them and I hope they are ok . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the word love with my in-laws . <p> The resident who is transferring one of his patients to me comes in to rounds to tell us about her . But first , he tells us that both of the towers have fallen . \" You mean collapsed to the ground ? \" someone says . Everyone looks numb , but no one else says anything . We go on . All I can think of is Mike . Both my feet seem to have fallen asleep as I realize that I would never be able to do any of the things I do without him . I could not be a doctor , could not continue my internship , could not be a good friend , could not be myself . We 've been together for six years , married for three months , and it dawns on me that what we have become is so much better than who we are individually . I think about what it would mean to lose that . A tear hits the page in front of me and I discover I am crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paged first -- a giant break in attending rounds protocol , so much so that I actually pretend that I 've been paged , looking down at my beeper at a number I ca n't even see . I go back to the same payphone . I pick up the phone and miss-dial the number twice before I can put the right numbers in the right sequence to call Kim and Jim . Kim picks up the phone , she says that Mike is there , that he and Jim went out to try to get cash out of an ATM . They are all ok . Mike and Jim come back from the store and Kim puts Mike on the phone . Hearing his voice makes me realize how tired I am and how much I want to be with him . <p> Mike asks if I can leave the hospital . They want to drive out of the city to someplace safe and want me to come , but all the roads are flooded with people trying to do the same . Mike starts to tell me about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tells me how he left Wall Street and traveled within two blocks of the towers to find a subway to take him uptown . He tells me about seeing some people fall out of the towers , and some people jump , holding hands . How thousands of other people were just standing , out in the open , watching , unable to move or look away . He wants me to come home soon . I tell him I do n't think I can leave the hospital for the next few days . I tell him I love him . I have to wait to stop crying before I can go back to rounds . <p> Rounds are ending , thank god , and the rest of the day passes in a daze . I am busy , frantically rushing to get all my work on the patients who are in the hospital already done so that I can be ready when more arrive . We keep waiting for people , keep asking if anyone has shown up yet in the emergency room , if ambulances have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smoke plume from downtown shifts directions , and the whole hospital starts to smell like smoke . \" Is something burning ? \" one of my patients asks me . \" Yes , \" I say , \" Downtown . \" Televisions in every patient room are on , blaring , with news from the disaster . My friend O -- hears from his mom at around 1PM . She was evacuated safely . <p> We can hear helicopters and planes screeching overhead , ambulances and firetrucks below and see all the traffic stopped going up the West Side Highway . There is a bomb threat on the George Washington Bridge , which is a few blocks from the hospital . We all eye it from the windows as we go about our day . All day , as I come across people , the greeting is always , \" How are you doing ? Do you know anyone down there ? \" We are all trying to both get our work done and call relatives , friends , anyone we know who might have any reason to be downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of downtown , ash covered , heads down , not looking back , a gray pilgrimage pouring over every bridge , up the FDR and West Side Highway away from the disaster . There are no cars , so they walk on the five-lane highways and avenues , and soot drops on them as they go . From the hospital , we can look down and watch them pour over the GWB , having walked the length of Manhattan in their dress shoes and suits to go home to their families in New Jersey . <p> Mike actually got on the subway before the buildings collapsed , before the subway stopped running . So he came up to midtown on a train of people , half of whom knew what was happening and half of whom had been on the subway since Brooklyn and were still living in the New York City where none of this was possible . They only made it to midtown though , and then Mike ran though Central Park , leaving dusty footprints in the jogging lane , to Kim and Jim 's apartment on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12th , I 'm finished with all my work . I have n't gotten any more new admissions since those I heard about in the morning when we first went on disaster mode . All of my patients are \" tucked in \" for the night . But no one is sleeping . The patients on our service , many gaunt with AIDS and haunted by traumas , past and present , are wandering the halls of the ward , staring at each other as they pass by , iv poles in hand , walkers pushed in front of them . Roommates who have ignored each other in spite of being five feet apart through their entire hospital stay are talking to one another . <p> The ER is like a ghost town . Eerily silent , yet full of doctors , nurses , social workers , many of whom just showed up at the hospital that morning to see if they were needed . The surgery interns are sitting on empty gurneys , swinging their legs over the side and waiting for patients who are n't coming . Occasionally someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or \" its like a movie . \" The only loud sounds are the telephones , which the social workers are answering , telling caller after caller , all in tears , that we have n't seen their wife , son , partner , mommy , that they have n't been sent to our hospital . <p> Downtown , we hear that they set up a triage center and the building fell on it , killing all the emergency workers , including the disaster coordinator for the state of New York . Then they set up another one and then rubble fell and destroyed it as well . I keep thinking that if I hear anything worse than what I 've just heard I will break down , be unable to do my job . But then I do and I just get more numb . I desperately want someone to hug me so that I can just cry and stop pretending to be a doctor . <p> I go to the resident lounge to find out what I should do next . All day , I 've actually looked forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people caught up in this nightmare . But when I get to the lounge it is full of residents watching TV with tears in their eyes . I ask one of the chief residents what I should do next . There is nothing . No survivors are beating down our doors . The thousands of people who walked out of the financial district , looking like ghosts covered with white ash , do n't need our help . Like my husband , they are home with their families , trying to put words to what they saw . The other thousands who were still in the buildings at the time of their collapse are beyond our help . They tell me to go home and sleep . <p> So , at 1:30AM , I take a gypsy cab from the hospital to my apartment . I share it with my friend R -- , who spent the entire afternoon looking for her grandmother who works on the forty-fifth floor of tower two . It turns out that her grandmother had been late to work that day , which saved her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her tower , and was able to get out safely but had smoke inhalation and could n't contact her kids ( or grandkids ) until around 7PM . On our way home we pass a large FedEx truck , surrounded by police cars , firemen , and dogs . As the cab slides silently past , I am sure that it will blow up . It does n't . <p> I crawl in to bed with Mike at 2AM . He is not asleep . I get the hug that I 've needed all day , and say a quick prayer of thanks that I , unlike so many people tonight , have someone to come home to . Then I feel selfish for thinking that . Mike has fallen asleep when a truck rumbles down Amsterdam and he awakes with a start . \" I thought it was a plane , \" he says . At four AM I get back up to go back to the hospital . I cry as I dress , and step out of my door into a ghost town , where nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my street to sell me breakfast , and no cabs . I take the subway back to the hospital . There are very few morning commuters . At the top of Columbia Presbyterian , my friend Jeff and I walk to the window and look downtown . There is a hole in the sky , and below it a red glow . Smoke pours into and out of that hole in the sky . The Empire State Building , always dwarfed , looks huge and vulnerable . I am afraid for it . <p> The next few days are still a blur . I spend all day Wednesday in the hospital , where we still have hope for caring for some of the victims as the digging begins , and again I am sent home early in the morning on Thursday because there is no one to fix . I sleep four more hours that night , and then my schedule changes , so that on Thursday evening I leave the hospital before it is dark for the first time in a week . My blurry eyes look around at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every window . On the subway , people are deferential , and try to give everyone some personal space . In shops , on the sidewalks , and street corners , people speak quietly , and it is not uncommon for someone to be crying as they go about mundane tasks . Church , temple , synagogue and mosque doors are all flung open , with signs that say come in to pray in many languages . Many shops are closed , and on those shop fronts , on bus stop overhangs , and on the sides of buildings all over the city are the missing signs . The faces of people who did n't walk out . What they were wearing , how tall they are , how much they weigh , which tower , what floor they were on . <p> Over the next week , we , the City of New York , the New Yorkers , Gotham , learn that we actually are one group . That though we are the most diverse city in the world , we do belong to something . That something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are n't alone . We greet friends and acquaintances we have n't seen yet with \" How are you doing . Did you know anyone down there ? \" When the phones are working we continue the calls to friends and colleagues who we have n't heard from . We flinch every time we get an answering machine . We go to Union Square and light candles in front of the pictures , the poems , the paintings that are our response to what has happened to us . We clean our apartments and sweep up the white dust that seems to be everywhere . We look up into the sky with dread every time we hear an airplane , we walk quickly past tall buildings , we jump at loud noises that were part of regular life in Manhattan just a few days ago . <p> Now , weeks later , I cry when I read the paper . Mike , who sat at home with nothing to do the first two days after the disaster , has returned to work to watch the market fall and fall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for the first week with his clothes smelling like smoke . He is less on edge . We are more able to talk about things other than what happened that day . But we still do n't have a name for it . Its funny , but no one in New York seems to refer to it as the attack , and the bright logos and big adjectives used by the news networks seem unbelievably inappropriate in our gray , solemn city . We call it \" Tuesday \" or \" the 11th \" or \" the disaster \" or just \" what happened . \" We still can not really describe what it is like to wake up to a world where none of the rules you thought applied to your life , or your safety , or your ability to see the people you saw today again tomorrow , work anymore .

the way to wall street and the trade center . in the mornings , after about an hour of work , i can see the sun rise and glint pink off the twin towers , and think , mike 's down there . tuesday was a clear day , and we had a great view . <p> i called mike , who works on wall street , about ten blocks from the towers . he picks up the phone immediately and says \" we 're ok . \" news is starting to

Guess which one I 'm going to turn on tonight ? ) <p> In The Big Screen , British-American film critic and historian David Thomson attempts to answer some fundamental questions about the world 's favorite hobby . How do we relate to the movies ? \" The cinema is the embodiment of ' let there be light , ' \" he writes . But where does the light come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , these are difficult and possibly even unanswerable questions . But Thomson -- arguably the world 's most intelligent student of the cinema -- proves remarkably up to the task .

Griffith 's brilliant but notoriously racist The Birth of a Nation to the critically reviled Adam Sandler \" comedy \" Jack and Jill . While there 's not an even remotely boring chapter in the book , the centerpiece of the volume is formed of two long essays , \" Sunset and Change \" and \" Film Studies , \" in which Thomson jumps from topic to topic breathlessly , almost suddenly , but with transitions that somehow make more sense than they should . <p> David Thomson is the author of more than 20 books , including Have You Seen ... ? : A Personal Introduction to 1,000 Films and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Giroux hide caption <p> toggle caption Lucy Gray\/Farrar , Straus and Giroux <p> David Thomson is the author of more than 20 books , including Have You Seen ... ? : A Personal Introduction to 1,000 Films and The New Biographical Dictionary of Film . <p> Lucy Gray\/Farrar , Straus and Giroux <p> It 's like listening for an hour to a smart , hyperactive friend discuss the art he loves the most ; the downloading of information leaves you a little exhausted but mostly elated . Thomson has a gift for making his original observations sound almost obvious -- film noir , he writes , \" is the one genre that admits we 'll lose , \" and Casablanca is \" fake , foolish and fanciful beyond belief \" but is still \" the best fun . \" <p> And while he 's unafraid to dive into the canons of some of cinema 's most celebrated but challenging directors -- Michelangelo Antonioni and Ingmar Bergman are both discussed -- he takes a refreshingly democratic view .

And these : What does film do to us ? Does it isolate us or contribute to a common cultural language ? There are no sure-thing conclusions in art , but Thomson 's guess is as good as any : We watch movies to see ourselves from unrealistic angles , because we crave the feeling of desire , and we love the artifice , the uncertainty . \" It 's an impossible venture , \" Thomson writes , \" but it is a legacy of American film -- the gift of unreality . \" Or , in the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live . \" Movies , for many of us , are life , and for about 90 minutes , in the comforting darkness of a theater , we can pretend that nothing will ever end .

Better and more equal access to education -- including more Pell Grants and better student loan programs -- are essential if we are to strengthen incomes in the middle and bottom .

drew its name from the statue of a petite goddess across the street . <p> the years just prior to 1900 saw author charles maurras put the finishing touches to \" sous le signe de flore \" within , while the prewar years would see apollinaire and salmon use the ground floor to edit the arts review \" les soir ?

        "text":"<p> I 'm a budget traveler who has spent more time in dives with droopy mattresses than luxury hotels with spa treatments that cost more than Suriname 's annual GDP . So on the rare occasions when I get to stay someplace truly swanky -- usually when the Priceline roulette wheel shines favorably on me or if I 'm accompanying my wife on a business trip -- I sometimes feel a bit like Jed Clampett arriving with Hillbilly family in tow in Beverly Hills . <p> Did I shave that day ? Is my car the cheapest one on the premises ? How much do I need to give the bellboy who is charging over to open my car door ? I had this same fish-out-of-water feeling when we pulled up to the Andaz , a luxury hotel in West Hollywood that is part of the Hyatt chain last week . But the place turned out to be very different than any other fancy hotel I 've ever stayed in . <p> For starters , the young man who opened our car door and took care of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcases on a trolley , he escorted us into the sleek , dimly lit lobby , checked us in himself and then brought us up to the room as though we were at a small B &amp; B. <p> \" Now everything in the minibar except the alcohol is free , \" he said to my surprise and puzzlement . \" So all the soft drinks , bottles of water and snacks are free . \" <p> I asked him to repeat that because I 've never heard of a free minibar before and I did n't want to get a bill for a $9 bag of chips , but I 'd heard him right . The Andaz also has free wireless Internet and serves good , free California wines from 5-7 p.m. each night . Before I gush about this place a bit more , I should point out that unlike many \" reviews \" of luxury hotels , this is not a paid endorsement or quid-pro-quo deal . At Gadling , we do not write about free press trips or accept other free travel perks , so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was stylishly decorated and had a curtained off little section in the back with a love seat , comfy chair and Ottoman . My kids immediately claimed this area as their clubhouse , but it was also useful for my wife and I after the kids went to bed . <p> The hotel was renovated and turned into an Andaz property , one of just nine around the world , in 2009 . Gene Autry once owned the hotel and in the ' 60s , ' 70s and ' 80s , it was known as the Riot House because rock stars used to routinely trash their rooms . John Bonham reportedly once rode his motorcycle down the hotel corridors , Keith Richards once dropped a television set from his room out onto Sunset Boulevard , and Jim Morrison lived there until he was evicted for hanging out a window by his fingertips . <p> Those days are long gone , but recording artists still patronize the place . A big contingent of Brits including the singer Laura Mvula was there during our stay . And they still play great music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had the pleasure of listening to The Smiths at any other hotel I 've ever stayed at besides this one . <p> The Andaz has everything you might expect in a luxury hotel : incredibly comfortable beds , high-quality toiletries and linens , plus a very nice rooftop pool that offers lovely views of the area . We found the Sunset Boulevard location to be convenient but thanks to the notorious L.A. traffic , it can take a lot longer to get around than you might think . <p> And now for a few niggling complaints . No hotel is perfect and that includes the Andaz . I found the free wireless to be extremely slow at times and when I called down to inquire I was transferred to an off-site tech support person who suggested I pay a premium to get better speed . No thanks . The valet parking is $32 per night ( there is no self-park option ) , which is n't exactly a bargain and the sumptuous buffet breakfast is strictly expense account territory at $26 a head . <p> But you do n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're there for a treat and the Andaz certainly is one . Aside from the free snacks , soft drinks and wine , my other favorite perk was the selection of free newspapers . I 'm an old-school hard copy newspaper reader and the fact that the Andaz was willing to deliver copies of the New York Times , the L.A. Times and the Wall Street Journal right to my doorstop made me very happy indeed . On my last night at the Andaz , our neighbors stumbled back to their room at 2 a.m. and commenced a noisy party worthy of the hotel 's glory Riot House days . At the time , I was annoyed but in retrospect , it was a fitting end to a memorable stay . ",

About 1,200 of the 1,300 foxes on Santa Catalina Island , off the coast of Southern California , died as a result of the outbreak . Now , thanks to a program to save the species and several years ' worth of fortuitous weather patterns , their numbers have rebounded . Our colleague Louis Sahagun has the details in a story Tuesday ; here 's an excerpt : <p> Standing beside a sign posted along a main road urging people to watch for foxes , Carlos de la Rosa , the Catalina Island Conservancy 's chief conservation and education officer , said , \" Soon we 'll have more than 1,300 foxes . But reaching that number is not , in and of itself , as great an achievement as bringing them back from the brink of extinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . \" <p> The population had crashed to about 100 in 1999 , when the conservancy and the Institute for Wildlife Studies launched a $2-million recovery program that includes vaccinations , aerial monitoring and education programs . <p> A captive breeding program here ended in 2004 , the same year the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the cat-sized subspecies as endangered . About 950 Catalina Island foxes call the island home , up from 784 at this time last year , according to a recent islandwide trapping effort by conservancy wildlife biologists Julie King and Calvin Duncan . <p> The foxes are trapped once a year and inspected for illnesses , including an unusual , potentially fatal ear cancer that recently began showing up in older foxes . <p> The animal 's remarkable recovery was spurred , in part , by several years of fluctuations in the weather .

By the time breeding season arrived in 2008 , many foxes were literally obese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were having larger-than-normal litters . <p> Good rains the past two years triggered an abundance of fruit-bearing cactuses and a population explosion of mice , convenient prey for female foxes to feed to their pups.

Becker is accused of killing Aplington-Parkersburg High School teacher and coach Ed Thomas in June 2009 . ( AP Photo\/Conrad Schmidt <p> A jury found an Iowa man guilty Tuesday of first-degree murder in the shooting of a nationally known high school football coach . <p> It took the jury 24 hours over four days to reach its decision , finding Mark Becker , 24 , guilty in the June 24 , 2009 , killing of Aplington-Parkersburg coach Ed Thomas . <p> Becker gunned down Thomas , 58 , in the school 's makeshift weight room in front of students , shooting him at least six times before walking away .

Nothing that happened is going to bring my dad back , \" Aaron Thomas said . \" Our family is not over anything .

He also was a leader in rebuilding Parkersburg after nearly one-third of the 1,800-person town was wiped out in May 2008 by a tornado that killed six people . <p> Referring both to the conviction and to her son 's struggles with paranoid schizophrenia , Becker 's mother , Joan , said the past few years have been heartbreaking . <p> \" The last weeks , months and years have been extremely difficult for our family to bear , \" Joan Becker said , clasping her husband 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" system failed miserably \" when her family sought help for Mark Becker 's mental illness . <p> \" Ed Thomas was a victim of a victim , \" she said . \" Our sorrow runs very deep for the family of Ed Thomas and for our church family ... but most of all for our son , Mark , who we love so very much . \" <p> A conviction of first-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence in Iowa , which does n't have the death penalty . Becker 's appeal on the conviction is automatic . <p> The trial largely centered on Becker 's mental status on the day of the shooting . Prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed that Becker shot Thomas and that Becker suffered from paranoid schizophrenia that caused him to have intense hallucinations and delusions . <p> But prosecutors Scott Brown and Andy Prosser repeatedly argued that that mental illness was not equal to insanity . <p> The defense , represented by public defenders Susan Flander and Derek Jones , countered with witnesses who testified that Becker did n't understand what he was doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he hopes his hometown can finally return to normal . <p> \" Hopefully now we can be Parkersburg , a place without media , a place without cameras , \" he said . <p> It became clear during seven days of testimony that the killing could have been prevented , or at least postponed , if Becker had n't been released from the psychiatric ward of a Waterloo hospital . He was admitted to the psychiatric ward ? his third hospitalization in eight months ? on June 20 after he allegedly broke out the windows of a Cedar Falls man 's house and accused the man of trying to hypnotize him . <p> Becker then led police on a chase that reached speeds of 90 mph before he hit a deer and surrendered to Butler County Sheriff Jason Johnson . <p> He was released from the hospital on June 23 , and the next morning he drove to the high school and killed Thomas . <p> The issue of Becker 's sanity took up the last two days of testimony , as the defense and prosecution introduced competing witnesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed Satan had possessed Thomas and that he was doing the community a favor ? and freeing Parkersburg 's children ? by killing the coach . <p> Resnick and others who interviewed Becker about his mental status said Becker suffered from such intense delusions that he incorrectly believed Thomas and the members of Becker 's old football team were sexually assaulting him , and that Thomas was trying to make Becker into a \" sex slave . \" <p> Maryland-based psychiatrist Michael Spodak , hired by the prosecution , agreed Becker suffered from severe mental problems , including paranoid schizophrenia , but said he still understood right and wrong . Spodak said Becker took rational measures to avoid detection on the morning of the shooting : He hid his gun while he was driving , told passersby that he was searching for Thomas in order to volunteer for the city 's tornado relief efforts and made it a point to avoid shooting the teenagers in the weight room .

I 'm Rebecca Roberts in Washington . <p> Forty years ago tomorrow , on May 4th , 1970 , students at Kent State University in Ohio gathered to protest America 's involvement in the Vietnam War . The Ohio National Guard , in its efforts to disperse the crowd , opened fire . When the smoke cleared , four students were dead and nine were wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nationwide student strike , forcing hundreds of colleges and universities to close . Ten days later , police opened fire at a group of protestors at Jackson State University in Mississippi . Two students were killed and a dozen more injured . Today , we revisit Kent State and Jackson State , 40 years later . <p> So what do you remember from that time 40 years ago ? What did the event mean to you ? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255 . Our email address is talk@npr.org , and you can join the conversation at our website . Go to npr.org , and click on TALK OF THE NATION . <p> ROBERTS : Joining us now from member station WKSU in Kent , Ohio , is Jerry Lewis . He 's a professor emeritus of sociology at Kent State University . Welcome to the program . <p> Dr. JERRY LEWIS ( Professor Emeritus of Sociology , Kent State University ) : Thank you very much . Nice to be here . <p> ROBERTS : Give us a quick history lesson . What led up to the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEWIS : Well , the major thing was the announcement by President Nixon that the troops had invaded Cambodia , which signaled to students , particularly students but all males who were eligible for the draft , that the war was not only not ending , but it was spreading . <p> Then on Friday night , there was a protest in downtown Kent . Saturday , an ROTC building was attacked . Sunday , there was another confrontation with the National Guard that had come on campus when the ROTC building was attacked , and then May 4th occurred . <p> ROBERTS : And that day , some there was some debate about whether or not to close the campus ? <p> Dr. LEWIS : Well , Governor Rhodes said in his famous press conference on Sunday , May 3rd , that the campus would not be closed . And so , students had gathered on the commons on May 4th a little before noon to protest the presence of the Guard . <p> The character of the protest changed from anti-war to anti-Guard . And then about 12:00 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a hill . Some of the students went on a veranda of one of our buildings and other students went down in a parking lot , and the National Guard went into a practice football field , where there became an exchange of tear gas back and forth . <p> Then the Guard all of a sudden turned around , started heading right back up the hill where they came from . When they got to the top of the hill , near what we call the pagoda , the right rear echelon of Guardsman fired . A total of 28 Guardsmen fired between 61 and 67 rounds over 13 seconds . My good friend , Dean Kahler , was hit and seriously wounded , and he 'll probably talk about that . <p> ROBERTS : And where were you ? <p> Dr. LEWIS : I was standing in a parking lot behind Sandy Scheuer . I was a faculty marshal , and having been in the Army , I knew that they were firing real bullets because I saw the smoke come out of the weapons . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Sandy Scheuer was one of the students who was killed . Did you realize she was dead ? <p> Dr. LEWIS : I did shortly afterwards . I did n't know it was Sandy Scheuer because when I came up after the shootings ended , I walked a few paces . A student rushed up and said , Dr. Lewis , those were blanks , were n't they ? And I pointed to a body , I later learned it was Sandy Scheuer , and I realized the students thought they were blanks . And I wanted to get them to get out of there , so I began to run around the back of the parking lot saying - I 'm Dr. Lewis , those are real bullets , you must leave . <p> ROBERTS : Do we know why the Guardsmen fired ? <p> Dr. LEWIS : No , that 's the fundamental question . Dean 's shaking his head , and that 's we do n't know . And one of things we learned as Dr. Young was talking with me shortly before the interview is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why they 're so important . <p> They 're demanding on us emotionally , but they 're very important to our knowledge about May 4th , because people come forward and tell things that they have n't told for years . <p> For instance , on the 20th anniversary , I had a student walk up to me and hand me some brass from an M-1 bullet that she had kept in her drawer for 20 years . So these things are going on all over campus and the town of Kent , I 'm sure . People are coming forth with material . Someday , we may learn about why the Guard fired . <p> ROBERTS : Did they ever apologize ? <p> Dr. LEWIS : No . The only thing they did , when the civil suit was settled , and Dean can talk about that later on , was they issued a statement of regret , which was pretty weak . Mrs. Holstein has said that she was hoping for a much stronger statement of apology . <p> Now , later on , at the in 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorial , the former governor of the state of Ohio , Richard Celeste , did apologize to , not only to the parents of the slain students but to the wounded students . But he was no longer a sitting governor when he did that . <p> ROBERTS : Let 's take a call . This is Brenda(ph) in Syracuse , New York . Brenda , welcome to TALK OF THE NATION . <p> BRENDA ( Caller ) : Yes . <p> ROBERTS : Hi , Brenda , you 're on the air . <p> BRENDA : Oh my gosh , okay . Okay , I just turned off the car . <p> ROBERTS : Okay , I 'm glad you 're safe . Go ahead . What 's your comment ? <p> BRENDA : Just that I was at Ohio State during that time . I had a three-month-old baby , a husband who turned in a master 's degree and was arrested during that time . The university itself was shut down after Kent State , and 40,000 students . And the memory of looking at kids my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Guard and they were standing there with bayoneted rifles staring at us . <p> And I think everybody was absolutely in was fearful of each other without knowing each other or understanding each other . And there was this crazy war going on , and it just felt like a time of real insanity in the country . <p> ROBERTS : And Brenda , what happened at Ohio State in the following days ? <p> BRENDA : What happened at Ohio State was there was a lot of protesting . There was a lot of shock . But they closed the campus immediately . There was they just shut down all the classes . It was closed for about two weeks , if I remember correctly . <p> Dr. LEWIS : And that went on all over the nation . We do n't have real good data but our estimate is there were 800 schools closed down , over four million students on strike . <p> Of course , Kent State was shut , and we were on the quarter system , as Ohio State was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of it , through correspondence , lectures in churches and other places . <p> ROBERTS : We have two emails , one from Shelly(ph) in St. Paul who says : I was 21 , married and living in Lima , Ohio . I saw the breaking news of the Kent State shootings on TV at my mother-in-law 's home . Her response was , they shouldve shot them all . That was a common response heard in the community at the time . I was horrified but not surprised . It 's an extremely conservative part of the state and still is . <p> And Judy(ph) adds a similar memory . She says : Sadly , I remember the shootings vividly . I was working in the business office of a local university with several retired military men . One of them stood up and proclaimed to the office that the actions of the Guard at Kent State was the best way to handle these student protests , that if we shot more of them , the protests would cease . <p> You know , 40 years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , it was n't that uncommon . <p> Dr. LEWIS : Well , I think Dean has a wonderful story that clarifies this , but this happened all the time . We in sociology call this victimology , where you blame the victim for their own demise or injury . So , Dean , you want to tell them about your ... <p> ROBERTS : I should introduce Dean Kahler . He was shot and paralyzed during the Kent State student demonstration . He 's also there at WKSU . And with any luck , his microphone is on . Dean Kahler , are you with us ? <p> Mr. DEAN KAHLER ( Former Student , Kent State University ) : Yes , I am . And Jerry is referring to one of the actually , the first correspondence I opened up after I came out of the induced coma on Friday , after the shootings . And it started off with : Dear communist hippie radical , I hope by the time you read this , you are dead . <p> Basically , I think that that person was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by Richard Nixon , Spiro Agnew , Governor Rhodes . Richard Nixon , Spiro Agnew had called us bums , effete snobs , and I think Spiro Agnew had called us nattering nabobs of negatism . And Governor Rhodes made a famous speech on the 3rd of May , saying that we were the worst element in our society , worse than the communists , the knight riders and the vigilantes . <p> The hate speech of the time , I used to call it rhetoric , was just as vitriolic as it is today . And it 's unfortunate that those words do have consequences . <p> ROBERTS : Now , of course , one of the other reactions was in the opposite direction . And we 've got two emails from people who were radicalized by watching Kent State . <p> Steve(ph) in Bemis Point , New York , says : I was a senior at Notre Dame . I was a Navy ROTC . In a matter of weeks , I was going to graduate and be commissioned as a Navy officer and get married . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports could suggest the Guard was shot at first . I remember one of my classmates who was from Ohio had joined the National Guard to avoid the draft and Vietnam , and he went to Washington , D.C. , to protest the war after this event . <p> And Sandra(ph) in Philadelphia says she lived in Akron , Ohio , at the time , worked at a medical library at the closest children 's hospital to Kent State : Up until that incident , I had been a pretty conventional young person . I was 20 . But when I saw my government killing innocent students who were just walking to class , I was radicalized , totally radicalized . From that day forward , I began to immerse myself in national and international news and politics and have never since allowed myself to be so ignorant of what 's going on as I was before that day . <p> Dr. LEWIS : Well , that rings very true . My colleague and I , Ray Adam(ph) , collected some data on students who were directly exposed to social controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th . And we collected the data two years after the shootings , and we found that exactly that had happened . Those directly exposed to the shootings had been radicalized as measured by - not being violent , but particularly increased political activity . And that political activity , for the most part , was against the war . <p> ROBERTS : Well , and then there , you know , similar protests in campuses all over the country , there was that iconic sign , I think it was at Columbia , that said : they ca n't kill us all . <p> Prof. LEWIS : Yeah . One of my colleagues who takes leadership in May 4th , Laura Davis(ph) , tells a story that she and - as the marshals convinced the students to leave the commons , they - she was walking with two of her friends and she whispered to the two friends , we 'll all run in opposite directions , they ca n't shoot us all . But that was a kind of worry we had when we 're dealing - because what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly , is that this Guard was not under control . And thank God , of the 71 Guardsmen on the hill , only 28 fired their weapons . Can you imagine if all 71 had fired their weapons ? <p> Mr. KAHLER : And not everyone thought that the rifles were full of blanks . Being a country boy and having hunted with rifles and shotguns , I took many courses in gun safety . And there is only one time you can assume without , you know , with only one time you can assume with impunity , and that 's when you see a rifle or a shotgun . You always assume it 's loaded until you check the chamber yourself . So I had no illusions that they had blanks in their rifles when they shot . When they turned and started to fire , I said to myself , they 're going to shoot , and I jumped on the ground and had no place to hide . And then , I could hear the rounds hitting me - hitting on the ground around me before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , to the point where I became very involved in politics . And , you know , to this day , I still write letters and email my congressmen and my senators , as well . <p> ROBERTS : That is Dean Kahler . He was an undergraduate at Kent State in 1970 and one of the nine students wounded by the Ohio National Guard . We are also joined by Jerry Lewis , a professor emeritus of sociology at Kent State University . He - both of them are joining us from WKSU , our member station in Kent , Ohio . <p> And we are taking your calls at 800-989-8255 . If you remember where you were that day , if you remember the effects of the Kent State events on your life and your family 's life , 800-989-8255 . You can send us email : talk@npr.org . Or you can join the conversation at our website . Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION . <p> ROBERT ( Caller ) : Hello . I had a different perspective , perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in second grade at the time . I remember the guard coming into town and I believe it was that day they took us out of school . And we had to - my bus rode right past the campus and we were told to duck . We were escorted by a convoy of other National Guard . <p> So , you know , a second grader has a way different impression of these events than does an adult . But , you know , I 've learned a lot since then , seeing some of the photographs from the day . And I did n't realize it , I guess , until this morning but , you know , people in Kent - people at Kent State think of the event as a - the May 4th time or simply May 4th , where the rest of the country calls it Kent State . And it dawned on me this morning that it really is more of a 9\/11 type of feel , I think , for people who had that kind of connection to it . So , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well ... <p> ROBERTS : Thanks , Robert . <p> Prof. LEWIS : That 's very good , and you 're quite right . Schools were closed down not only in Kent - that was after the shootings - but all over the county . The county airport was closed down . There were jeeps driving around the little college north of Kent called Hiram College . So there was - but , you see , that 's a classic example of blaming the victim . The victims or the students were being blamed for the shootings and , therefore , the National Guard had to protect schoolchildren from the students , but in fact , the killing was done by the National Guard . <p> Well , one of the problems - and , Robert , you may have heard this - that a -there was a mistake on a press release that went out over the wire services . And it said that two Guardsmen had been killed , and that caused a great deal of problems and concerns which we had to deal with . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So , many of townspeople thought the Guardsmen had been killed by students , and of course , that was not the case . In fact , there were only two Guardsmen injured and one was from a hyperventilation . <p> ROBERTS : And , Jerry Lewis , as a faculty member at the time , how good was your information ? Did you all really understand the extent of what had happened ? <p> Prof. LEWIS : Well , we certainly understood immediately that there were injuries and deaths , but not the scope of - I only - I took field notes three hours after shootings and I identified three people who were down , one who I thought was killed , that was Sandy Scheuer . I did n't realize the scope of this at all . <p> And we further did n't realize is the scope of the impact as you 're getting calls from all over the nation , how impactful the events of May 4th and 10 days later , Jackson State were on the nation . And we did n't realize as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that war came home . And the other thing that impacted on us was the famous picture of Mary Vecchio screaming over the body of Jeffrey Miller , which was all over all the media and being talked about . So , no , we really did n't realize ... <p> ROBERTS : And won the Pulitzer Prize . I understand that 's more ... <p> Prof. LEWIS : Yes , sure . <p> ROBERTS : ... a little back-story to that picture . <p> Prof. LEWIS : Well , you know , John Filo was a student and he - I 'm not sure what back-story means , but I think I know . John was worried about the FBI confiscating his camera , so he drove over to a small paper in Pennsylvania where he had interned . And he said to the editor , I think I 've got some good pictures and , in fact , won the Pulitzer Prize with the picture . But he actually has even better one , he 's told me , that he thinks is more powerful that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , 40 years ago . We are going to talk about Jackson State , where students were killed 10 days later in just a minute . But we do need to say goodbye to Jerry Lewis . I know that you have to go . He 's a professor of emeritus - professor emeritus of sociology at Kent State University . Thank you so much for joining us . <p> Prof. LEWIS : Thank you for inviting me . <p> ROBERTS : And Dean Kahler will stay with us . He was shot and paralyzed that day , May 4th , 1970 . And we are taking your calls . What does Kent State mean to you ? We will hear your stories in a moment . 808-989-8255 is the number to call , or you can email us : talk@npr.org . Or you can join the conversation at the website . Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION . <p> I 'm Rebecca Roberts . This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News . <p> ( Soundbite of music ) <p> ROBERTS : Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1970 , the shootings at Kent State University . In the span of about 13 seconds , National Guard troops shot and killed four unarmed students and wounded nine others , including our guest , Dean Kahler . <p> We have posted an audio slideshow of the events of that day with the help of WKSU , our member station at Kent State . If you go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION , you can see some of these iconic images . Special thanks also to Coburn Dukehart , our digital media team , for her help . <p> Dean Kahler , why do n't you tell us the story of that day from your perspective ? <p> Mr. KAHLER : I woke up that morning after a long night dealing with the chaos that was happening in my dormitory . I decided not to go to my classes , but I made phone calls to my professors ' office and let them know that I was n't coming . I did n't have any exams scheduled that day . And after spending some time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate lunch , and with a group of them , we walked over to the commons . <p> It was a beautiful day . We saw people standing around . There was a thousand or a couple of thousand people with a bullhorn talking about the isms , but probably only about maybe 50 of them were actually involved in that little discussion . I was on the side of the hill looking down upon them , getting a little bored , wondering what had to do with the war in Vietnam , when were we getting out of it , when we 're going to leave Cambodia , what was the role of the National Guard , what was the responsibility of us as students , what could we do and what could we not do ? <p> So I went there with those three main purposes . And was getting a little tired at that point in time . I was thinking about possibly going to the student union , get a cup of coffee . They came out and said that they were gathered illegally . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noontime on a campus that primarily is made up of commuter students . Where are they going to go ? <p> And so , it was greeted with a lot of jeering and cheers and anti-war slogans . They went back , they came back again , then , a few minutes later , read the Riot Act to us , which was , again , greeted with jeering and cheering and anti-war slogans . And then I saw them gathering together - near the burned out ROTC building . They were loading these tubes that had rifle stocks on them . I found out later that 's what they put tear gas canisters in to launch them . And all of a sudden , they formed up and then they shot about 15 - 10 , 15 tear gas canisters at us and dispersed the several thousand students that were there . <p> I went around the building , down the other side of the hill , across the parking lot , across the street into another parking lot . And at that point in time , I cleared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had brought along . And I remember grabbing a handful of gravel , flinging it underhand in the direction of the National Guard , who were about 150 yards away from me at this point in time . 150 yards . And so , I actually hit some students who were in front of me , who turned around and gave me the finger and swore at me . <p> And then I remember ducking down behind a pile of gravel in this gravel parking lot because it was n't used as a parking lot anymore . It was a construction site , a supply depot , and there was gravel there . Because the National Guard were pointing their weapons , and I thought , oh , my God , what are they doing pointing their weapons ? So I got behind this pile of gravel . <p> I then saw them stand up , get together in a huddle and then start moving in the direction of Taylor Hall again , because they have come the same path I did . They came up the hill , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . And I thought , well , I 'll follow along . Its almost 12:20 or so . Ill work my way over to the Student Union , get a cup of coffee to go to my 1:00 class . <p> And I finally made it over probably at the bottom of the hill on the practice football field around 100 yards away from them at the exact moment that they reached the top of the hill , turned and wheeled with their rifles in a shooting formation or shooting position and then commenced firing almost immediately . <p> And I thought to myself , oh , my God , they 're shooting at me . I jumped on the ground , covered my head . I heard bullets hitting the ground around me . And I 'm thinking , why are they shooting at me ? I 'm not directly in their line of fire . Apparently , I was , apparently . But I was n't doing anything . I was trying to stay a safe distance away from them . I did n't want to get near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And still , the bullets were hitting the ground around me . I would say probably eight or nine bullets hit the ground around me . But only one of them hit me and then the shooting stopped , and I was relieved . And then I remember ( unintelligible ) hollering out , I 'm hit . And someone came to my aid and got my parents ' phone number and called my parents . And they found out through a phone call almost immediately after the shootings . <p> ROBERTS : You mentioned the burned out ROTC building . We have email from Edward(ph) who says , did n't the radical students burn down the ROTC building ? This would heighten the climate of fear in violence . <p> Mr. KAHLER : That 's always been one of the misconceptions . The Justice Department and the President 's Commission on Student Unrest basically said that students did n't burn the building down . It was burned down by someone who knew how to burn building down . <p> At the time the building burned down , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally surrounded by campus security and local police authorities . And so there was really no reason to assume that the students burned the building down . But we have been blamed for it . It 's one of the myths of the burning of the ROTC building . <p> JACK ( Caller ) : Well , thank you . My memory of Kent State is that I was a junior in high school in my U.S. history class . I 'd always been a news junkie so I had been reading about the occurrence - about Kent State in the papers , in Life and magazine that came out that week . And I got into an argument with my high school history teacher because he was blaming the students , the syndrome you -one of your other callers mentioned . It was like there was this vast dichotomy if you were over 30 , the - it was the students ' fault . If you were under 30 , you looked at - at least I tried to read and be logical about it . And I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always struck in my memory , one of the students killed was something like 300 or 400 yards away from the protest and was on his way to his - to a class and he was an ROTC student that had nothing to do with the protest . And he was hit and killed . <p> Mr. KAHLER : Well , he was closer than that . Yeah . Yeah . But you 're absolutely right . The - we - the victims , were blamed for this , and that was primarily because in the late ' 60s and into the early ' 70s , the speeches by our political leaders who supported the war basically said that if you were against us , then you were a communist or you were a dirty hippy . And they used language to victimize people who disagreed with them . And the prevailing feeling on the part of most of the country when we got shot was that we deserved it because of the language that was used by our political leaders . <p> Back then , we were - you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall meet . So they used that language to victimize students . <p> ROBERTS : Well , Jack , mentioned that generational divide , and that 's mentioned in a lot of calls and emails we 're getting . Debra(ph) in Reno , Nevada says , she remembers coming home from high school that afternoon and her mother was watching TV and ironing . When I realized what she was watching , I was horrified and started crying and asked why , why , why ? My mother said they were throwing rocks . That was a paradigm shift for me . Our parents were not necessarily on our side anymore protecting us . Many of them thought that murdering students was justified . <p> Mr. KAHLER : Well , a capital sentence or a capital punishment usually is reserved for our courts . When did the National Guard and our political leaders give them the authority to execute students who disagreed with them ? Yes , there were some students who were throwing stones . But if you look at the photographs , the National Guard were doing the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had run out of tear gas and were returning the tear gas that was thrown at them and some were throwing the stones back at the students . But that does n't give the right of the law enforcement official in our country to execute students who were disagreeing with policies of our federal government . So , yes , there is a divide therein . <p> Let us see . It goes around to the hate speech , the language that was being used . We have to be careful of the language we use . We see it today . The language of dealing with the abortion issue is very vitriolic and has led to many deaths . Just the language around the health care reform bill led to congressmen being spit on when they were walking to the chamber . And , you know , we need to watch our language . I know our country has had a long history of using vitriolic language in political speech , but it does have consequences . <p> ROBERTS : We have an email from Lenny(ph) in Lake Worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also a member of the Ohio National Guard unit , although thanks be to God I was n't on active duty that day . Because there were so many race riots going on , we were held in reserve . After the fact , I most certainly blame then Governor Rhodes for these deaths and injuries . Dean Kahler , how satisfied are you that there was justice served in the wake of the Kent State shootings ? <p> Mr. KAHLER : I 'm satisfied that we have much of the record that is public on record - we could get a hold of as public record . I 'm not satisfied with the lack of justice that we had . And yes , Governor Rhodes was one of the major perpetrators of this . And it not only affected those of us who got shot , but it affected a whole generation of students who went to Kent State University in 1970 and had been labeled this . I know people who did n't get jobs just because they were a student at Kent . And so it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has affected those who were there . And yes , Governor Rhodes has a tremendous amount of responsibility for this , and no , justice has not been served in this particular matter yet . <p> ROBERTS : And what is planned on campus tomorrow ? <p> Mr. KAHLER : There is the usual day of speeches , of commemoration and memoriam to the students who were killed , and we will dowse the candles at approximately the time of the shootings , around 12:20 or so . And then there are some other activities that are happening - I mean , just a whole host of things . I do n't have the schedule in front of me and I did n't memorize it . But it 's a day of mourning , a day of celebration at the same time , and a day of looking forward . And not only do we mention the students who were shot here at Kent , but on the 15th of May , you know , students were killed in Jackson State . <p> I remember lying in my bed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oh my , God . What is going on with this country ? Are we going crazy or what ? And I just could n't believe it . It was probably one of the lowest periods of my time , coming so shortly after the shootings at Kent State . It did n't make my recovery any easier . <p> ROBERTS : Dean Kahler was a student at Kent State University 40 years ago . He was shot and paralyzed during the student demonstration on May 4th . He joined us from member station WKSU in Kent , Ohio . Thank you so much . <p> Mr. KAHLER : You 're welcome . <p> ROBERTS : You 're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News . And as Dean Kahler mentioned , 10 days after the Kent State shooting , an eerily familiar tragedy played out on the campus of Jackson State University in Mississippi . Police there fired on a group of students , killing two , hurting 12 others . Gene Young was a student on campus in 1970 . He 's now a civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now also from member station WKSU in Kent . <p> Gene Young , welcome to the program . <p> Mr. GENE YOUNG ( Former Professor , Jackson State University ) : Good afternoon . I 'm in Kent also for the 40th anniversary commemoration of the killings at Kent and Jackson State . <p> ROBERTS : We have had a couple of emails , including this one from Sharon(ph) , who says , what disturbs me is that a similar incident at Jackson State in Florida did n't receive - she says Florida , she means Mississippi - did n't receive the similar media coverage . That has become one of the things talked about when people mention the Jackson State incident . Why do you think that it was n't sort of seared into public consciousness as Kent State was ? <p> Mr. YOUNG : On the surface , Kent State was four white students in Ohio . Jackson State and Orangeburg were black colleges in the South . Two black students on a black college campus in Mississippi that had the history of Emmett Till , Medgar Evers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of business as usual , racist law enforcement officials victimizing black people in Mississippi . <p> ROBERTS : Can you tell us the story of what happened that day ? <p> Mr. YOUNG : Well , okay . Well , to its credit , Kent State is always included in Jackson Sate , so we never want to make cite and make you think that Kent State is not respecting regarding what happened a few days after the tragedy on this campus . But students at Jackson State campus on John Roy Lynch Street in Jackson , Mississippi , was a major thoroughfare . And motorists would drive through the campus making racist epitaph , making secular innuendos against some of the black female students on that campus . <p> And things just came to a head when law enforcement officials marched onto the campus in front of Alexander Hall women 's dormitory . And shortly after midnight , a bottle broke on the pavement and law enforcement officials fired over 200 rounds of bullets into a women 's dormitory from the bottom floor to the top floor . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic , that only two students were killed that night - James Earl Green , a high school student at Jim Hill who was on his way home from a part-time job and Philip Lafayette Gibbs , a junior , a pre-law major from Ripley , Mississippi , who was standing in front of the dormitory when the police opened fire without warning . <p> ROBERTS : And what could you possibly tell students ? In the aftermath , how did you keep total chaos from erupting ? <p> Mr. YOUNG : Dr. John Peoples , in his book \" To Survive and Thrive : The Quest for a True University , \" credits me with coming on the scene immediately thereafter and start reciting some words that I had heard in Washington , D.C. in 1963 , go back to Mississippi . Go back to Alabama . Go back to Louisiana . Go back to the slums and ghettos of our Northern cities knowing that somehow the situation can and will be changed . Let us not wallow in the valley of despair . And I say to you today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frustrations of the moment , I still have a dream . <p> Those words and my voice had a calming effect on some of my fellow students who have been traumatized by the tragedy that just taken place on that campus . And I remember the blood-curling scream of Mary Gibbs when somebody told her it was her brother , Phillip Gibbs , who was one of the students who had been killed that evening . And we stayed out on the lawn of Alexander dormitory until the sun came up singing freedom songs and continued to recite some of Dr. King 's words throughout the night . <p> And the next morning , Dr. Peoples ended the semester at Jackson State in 1970 . And some of us - many students went home but some of us stayed on to try to bring attention to what had happened on the campus of Jackson State that morning . <p> ROBERTS : Gene Young is a civil rights activist who was a Jackson State student during the killings on May 14 , 1970 . He 's also a former professor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kent . Thank you so much for joining us . <p> Mr. YOUNG : Thank you . <p> ROBERTS : We owe a big thank you to WKSU .

what did the event mean to you ? our number here in washington is 800-989-8255 . our email address is talk@npr.org , and you can join the conversation at our website . go to npr.org , and click on talk of the nation . <p> roberts : joining us now from member station wksu in kent , ohio , is jerry lewis . he 's a professor emeritus of sociology at kent state university . welcome to the program . <p> dr. jerry lewis ( professor emeritus of sociology , kent state university ) : thank you very much . nice to be here . <p> roberts : give us a quick history lesson . what led up to the ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lewis : well , the major thing was the announcement by president nixon that the troops had invaded cambodia , which signaled to students , particularly students but all males who were eligible for the draft , that the war was not only not ending , but it was spreading . <p> then on friday night , there was a protest in downtown kent . saturday , an rotc building was attacked . sunday , there was another confrontation with the national guard that had come on campus when the rotc building was attacked , and then may 4th occurred . <p> roberts : and that day , some there was some debate about whether or not to close the campus ? <p> dr. lewis : well , governor rhodes said in his famous press conference on sunday , may 3rd , that the campus would not be closed . and so , students had gathered on the commons on may 4th a little before noon to protest the presence of the guard . <p> the character of the protest changed from anti-war to anti-guard . and then about 12:00 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a hill . some of the students went on a veranda of one of our buildings and other students went down in a parking lot , and the national guard went into a practice football field , where there became an exchange of tear gas back and forth . <p> then the guard all of a sudden turned around , started heading right back up the hill where they came from . when they got to the top of the hill , near what we call the pagoda , the right rear echelon of guardsman fired . a total of 28 guardsmen fired between 61 and 67 rounds over 13 seconds . my good friend , dean kahler , was hit and seriously wounded , and he 'll probably talk about that . <p> roberts : and where were you ? <p> dr. lewis : i was standing in a parking lot behind sandy scheuer . i was a faculty marshal , and having been in the army , i knew that they were firing real bullets because i saw the smoke come out of the weapons . so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sandy scheuer was one of the students who was killed . did you realize she was dead ? <p> dr. lewis : i did shortly afterwards . i did n't know it was sandy scheuer because when i came up after the shootings ended , i walked a few paces . a student rushed up and said , dr. lewis , those were blanks , were n't they ? and i pointed to a body , i later learned it was sandy scheuer , and i realized the students thought they were blanks . and i wanted to get them to get out of there , so i began to run around the back of the parking lot saying - i 'm dr. lewis , those are real bullets , you must leave . <p> roberts : do we know why the guardsmen fired ? <p> dr. lewis : no , that 's the fundamental question . dean 's shaking his head , and that 's we do n't know . and one of things we learned as dr. young was talking with me shortly before the interview is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why they 're so important . <p> they 're demanding on us emotionally , but they 're very important to our knowledge about may 4th , because people come forward and tell things that they have n't told for years . <p> for instance , on the 20th anniversary , i had a student walk up to me and hand me some brass from an m-1 bullet that she had kept in her drawer for 20 years . so these things are going on all over campus and the town of kent , i 'm sure . people are coming forth with material . someday , we may learn about why the guard fired . <p> roberts : did they ever apologize ? <p> dr. lewis : no . the only thing they did , when the civil suit was settled , and dean can talk about that later on , was they issued a statement of regret , which was pretty weak . mrs. holstein has said that she was hoping for a much stronger statement of apology . <p> now , later on , at the in 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorial , the former governor of the state of ohio , richard celeste , did apologize to , not only to the parents of the slain students but to the wounded students . but he was no longer a sitting governor when he did that . <p> roberts : let 's take a call . this is brenda(ph) in syracuse , new york . brenda , welcome to talk of the nation . <p> brenda ( caller ) : yes . <p> roberts : hi , brenda , you 're on the air . <p> brenda : oh my gosh , okay . okay , i just turned off the car . <p> roberts : okay , i 'm glad you 're safe . go ahead . what 's your comment ? <p> brenda : just that i was at ohio state during that time . i had a three-month-old baby , a husband who turned in a master 's degree and was arrested during that time . the university itself was shut down after kent state , and 40,000 students . and the memory of looking at kids my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national guard and they were standing there with bayoneted rifles staring at us . <p> and i think everybody was absolutely in was fearful of each other without knowing each other or understanding each other . and there was this crazy war going on , and it just felt like a time of real insanity in the country . <p> roberts : and brenda , what happened at ohio state in the following days ? <p> brenda : what happened at ohio state was there was a lot of protesting . there was a lot of shock . but they closed the campus immediately . there was they just shut down all the classes . it was closed for about two weeks , if i remember correctly . <p> dr. lewis : and that went on all over the nation . we do n't have real good data but our estimate is there were 800 schools closed down , over four million students on strike . <p> of course , kent state was shut , and we were on the quarter system , as ohio state was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of it , through correspondence , lectures in churches and other places . <p> roberts : we have two emails , one from shelly(ph) in st. paul who says : i was 21 , married and living in lima , ohio . i saw the breaking news of the kent state shootings on tv at my mother-in-law 's home . her response was , they shouldve shot them all . that was a common response heard in the community at the time . i was horrified but not surprised . it 's an extremely conservative part of the state and still is . <p> and judy(ph) adds a similar memory . she says : sadly , i remember the shootings vividly . i was working in the business office of a local university with several retired military men . one of them stood up and proclaimed to the office that the actions of the guard at kent state was the best way to handle these student protests , that if we shot more of them , the protests would cease . <p> you know , 40 years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , it was n't that uncommon . <p> dr. lewis : well , i think dean has a wonderful story that clarifies this , but this happened all the time . we in sociology call this victimology , where you blame the victim for their own demise or injury . so , dean , you want to tell them about your ... <p> roberts : i should introduce dean kahler . he was shot and paralyzed during the kent state student demonstration . he 's also there at wksu . and with any luck , his microphone is on . dean kahler , are you with us ? <p> mr. dean kahler ( former student , kent state university ) : yes , i am . and jerry is referring to one of the actually , the first correspondence i opened up after i came out of the induced coma on friday , after the shootings . and it started off with : dear communist hippie radical , i hope by the time you read this , you are dead . <p> basically , i think that that person was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by richard nixon , spiro agnew , governor rhodes . richard nixon , spiro agnew had called us bums , effete snobs , and i think spiro agnew had called us nattering nabobs of negatism . and governor rhodes made a famous speech on the 3rd of may , saying that we were the worst element in our society , worse than the communists , the knight riders and the vigilantes . <p> the hate speech of the time , i used to call it rhetoric , was just as vitriolic as it is today . and it 's unfortunate that those words do have consequences . <p> roberts : now , of course , one of the other reactions was in the opposite direction . and we 've got two emails from people who were radicalized by watching kent state . <p> steve(ph) in bemis point , new york , says : i was a senior at notre dame . i was a navy rotc . in a matter of weeks , i was going to graduate and be commissioned as a navy officer and get married . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports could suggest the guard was shot at first . i remember one of my classmates who was from ohio had joined the national guard to avoid the draft and vietnam , and he went to washington , d.c. , to protest the war after this event . <p> and sandra(ph) in philadelphia says she lived in akron , ohio , at the time , worked at a medical library at the closest children 's hospital to kent state : up until that incident , i had been a pretty conventional young person . i was 20 . but when i saw my government killing innocent students who were just walking to class , i was radicalized , totally radicalized . from that day forward , i began to immerse myself in national and international news and politics and have never since allowed myself to be so ignorant of what 's going on as i was before that day . <p> dr. lewis : well , that rings very true . my colleague and i , ray adam(ph) , collected some data on students who were directly exposed to social controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th . and we collected the data two years after the shootings , and we found that exactly that had happened . those directly exposed to the shootings had been radicalized as measured by - not being violent , but particularly increased political activity . and that political activity , for the most part , was against the war . <p> roberts : well , and then there , you know , similar protests in campuses all over the country , there was that iconic sign , i think it was at columbia , that said : they ca n't kill us all . <p> prof. lewis : yeah . one of my colleagues who takes leadership in may 4th , laura davis(ph) , tells a story that she and - as the marshals convinced the students to leave the commons , they - she was walking with two of her friends and she whispered to the two friends , we 'll all run in opposite directions , they ca n't shoot us all . but that was a kind of worry we had when we 're dealing - because what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly , is that this guard was not under control . and thank god , of the 71 guardsmen on the hill , only 28 fired their weapons . can you imagine if all 71 had fired their weapons ? <p> mr. kahler : and not everyone thought that the rifles were full of blanks . being a country boy and having hunted with rifles and shotguns , i took many courses in gun safety . and there is only one time you can assume without , you know , with only one time you can assume with impunity , and that 's when you see a rifle or a shotgun . you always assume it 's loaded until you check the chamber yourself . so i had no illusions that they had blanks in their rifles when they shot . when they turned and started to fire , i said to myself , they 're going to shoot , and i jumped on the ground and had no place to hide . and then , i could hear the rounds hitting me - hitting on the ground around me before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , to the point where i became very involved in politics . and , you know , to this day , i still write letters and email my congressmen and my senators , as well . <p> roberts : that is dean kahler . he was an undergraduate at kent state in 1970 and one of the nine students wounded by the ohio national guard . we are also joined by jerry lewis , a professor emeritus of sociology at kent state university . he - both of them are joining us from wksu , our member station in kent , ohio . <p> and we are taking your calls at 800-989-8255 . if you remember where you were that day , if you remember the effects of the kent state events on your life and your family 's life , 800-989-8255 . you can send us email : talk@npr.org . or you can join the conversation at our website . go to npr.org and click on talk of the nation . <p> robert ( caller ) : hello . i had a different perspective , perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in second grade at the time . i remember the guard coming into town and i believe it was that day they took us out of school . and we had to - my bus rode right past the campus and we were told to duck . we were escorted by a convoy of other national guard . <p> so , you know , a second grader has a way different impression of these events than does an adult . but , you know , i 've learned a lot since then , seeing some of the photographs from the day . and i did n't realize it , i guess , until this morning but , you know , people in kent - people at kent state think of the event as a - the may 4th time or simply may 4th , where the rest of the country calls it kent state . and it dawned on me this morning that it really is more of a 9\/11 type of feel , i think , for people who had that kind of connection to it . so , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : well ... <p> roberts : thanks , robert . <p> prof. lewis : that 's very good , and you 're quite right . schools were closed down not only in kent - that was after the shootings - but all over the county . the county airport was closed down . there were jeeps driving around the little college north of kent called hiram college . so there was - but , you see , that 's a classic example of blaming the victim . the victims or the students were being blamed for the shootings and , therefore , the national guard had to protect schoolchildren from the students , but in fact , the killing was done by the national guard . <p> well , one of the problems - and , robert , you may have heard this - that a -there was a mistake on a press release that went out over the wire services . and it said that two guardsmen had been killed , and that caused a great deal of problems and concerns which we had to deal with . and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> so , many of townspeople thought the guardsmen had been killed by students , and of course , that was not the case . in fact , there were only two guardsmen injured and one was from a hyperventilation . <p> roberts : and , jerry lewis , as a faculty member at the time , how good was your information ? did you all really understand the extent of what had happened ? <p> prof. lewis : well , we certainly understood immediately that there were injuries and deaths , but not the scope of - i only - i took field notes three hours after shootings and i identified three people who were down , one who i thought was killed , that was sandy scheuer . i did n't realize the scope of this at all . <p> and we further did n't realize is the scope of the impact as you 're getting calls from all over the nation , how impactful the events of may 4th and 10 days later , jackson state were on the nation . and we did n't realize as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that war came home . and the other thing that impacted on us was the famous picture of mary vecchio screaming over the body of jeffrey miller , which was all over all the media and being talked about . so , no , we really did n't realize ... <p> roberts : and won the pulitzer prize . i understand that 's more ... <p> prof. lewis : yes , sure . <p> roberts : ... a little back-story to that picture . <p> prof. lewis : well , you know , john filo was a student and he - i 'm not sure what back-story means , but i think i know . john was worried about the fbi confiscating his camera , so he drove over to a small paper in pennsylvania where he had interned . and he said to the editor , i think i 've got some good pictures and , in fact , won the pulitzer prize with the picture . but he actually has even better one , he 's told me , that he thinks is more powerful that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , 40 years ago . we are going to talk about jackson state , where students were killed 10 days later in just a minute . but we do need to say goodbye to jerry lewis . i know that you have to go . he 's a professor of emeritus - professor emeritus of sociology at kent state university . thank you so much for joining us . <p> prof. lewis : thank you for inviting me . <p> roberts : and dean kahler will stay with us . he was shot and paralyzed that day , may 4th , 1970 . and we are taking your calls . what does kent state mean to you ? we will hear your stories in a moment . 808-989-8255 is the number to call , or you can email us : talk@npr.org . or you can join the conversation at the website . go to npr.org and click on talk of the nation . <p> i 'm rebecca roberts . this is talk of the nation from npr news . <p> ( soundbite of music ) <p> roberts : right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1970 , the shootings at kent state university . in the span of about 13 seconds , national guard troops shot and killed four unarmed students and wounded nine others , including our guest , dean kahler . <p> we have posted an audio slideshow of the events of that day with the help of wksu , our member station at kent state . if you go to npr.org and click on talk of the nation , you can see some of these iconic images . special thanks also to coburn dukehart , our digital media team , for her help . <p> dean kahler , why do n't you tell us the story of that day from your perspective ? <p> mr. kahler : i woke up that morning after a long night dealing with the chaos that was happening in my dormitory . i decided not to go to my classes , but i made phone calls to my professors ' office and let them know that i was n't coming . i did n't have any exams scheduled that day . and after spending some time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate lunch , and with a group of them , we walked over to the commons . <p> it was a beautiful day . we saw people standing around . there was a thousand or a couple of thousand people with a bullhorn talking about the isms , but probably only about maybe 50 of them were actually involved in that little discussion . i was on the side of the hill looking down upon them , getting a little bored , wondering what had to do with the war in vietnam , when were we getting out of it , when we 're going to leave cambodia , what was the role of the national guard , what was the responsibility of us as students , what could we do and what could we not do ? <p> so i went there with those three main purposes . and was getting a little tired at that point in time . i was thinking about possibly going to the student union , get a cup of coffee . they came out and said that they were gathered illegally . you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noontime on a campus that primarily is made up of commuter students . where are they going to go ? <p> and so , it was greeted with a lot of jeering and cheers and anti-war slogans . they went back , they came back again , then , a few minutes later , read the riot act to us , which was , again , greeted with jeering and cheering and anti-war slogans . and then i saw them gathering together - near the burned out rotc building . they were loading these tubes that had rifle stocks on them . i found out later that 's what they put tear gas canisters in to launch them . and all of a sudden , they formed up and then they shot about 15 - 10 , 15 tear gas canisters at us and dispersed the several thousand students that were there . <p> i went around the building , down the other side of the hill , across the parking lot , across the street into another parking lot . and at that point in time , i cleared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i had brought along . and i remember grabbing a handful of gravel , flinging it underhand in the direction of the national guard , who were about 150 yards away from me at this point in time . 150 yards . and so , i actually hit some students who were in front of me , who turned around and gave me the finger and swore at me . <p> and then i remember ducking down behind a pile of gravel in this gravel parking lot because it was n't used as a parking lot anymore . it was a construction site , a supply depot , and there was gravel there . because the national guard were pointing their weapons , and i thought , oh , my god , what are they doing pointing their weapons ? so i got behind this pile of gravel . <p> i then saw them stand up , get together in a huddle and then start moving in the direction of taylor hall again , because they have come the same path i did . they came up the hill , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . and i thought , well , i 'll follow along . its almost 12:20 or so . ill work my way over to the student union , get a cup of coffee to go to my 1:00 class . <p> and i finally made it over probably at the bottom of the hill on the practice football field around 100 yards away from them at the exact moment that they reached the top of the hill , turned and wheeled with their rifles in a shooting formation or shooting position and then commenced firing almost immediately . <p> and i thought to myself , oh , my god , they 're shooting at me . i jumped on the ground , covered my head . i heard bullets hitting the ground around me . and i 'm thinking , why are they shooting at me ? i 'm not directly in their line of fire . apparently , i was , apparently . but i was n't doing anything . i was trying to stay a safe distance away from them . i did n't want to get near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and still , the bullets were hitting the ground around me . i would say probably eight or nine bullets hit the ground around me . but only one of them hit me and then the shooting stopped , and i was relieved . and then i remember ( unintelligible ) hollering out , i 'm hit . and someone came to my aid and got my parents ' phone number and called my parents . and they found out through a phone call almost immediately after the shootings . <p> roberts : you mentioned the burned out rotc building . we have email from edward(ph) who says , did n't the radical students burn down the rotc building ? this would heighten the climate of fear in violence . <p> mr. kahler : that 's always been one of the misconceptions . the justice department and the president 's commission on student unrest basically said that students did n't burn the building down . it was burned down by someone who knew how to burn building down . <p> at the time the building burned down , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally surrounded by campus security and local police authorities . and so there was really no reason to assume that the students burned the building down . but we have been blamed for it . it 's one of the myths of the burning of the rotc building . <p> jack ( caller ) : well , thank you . my memory of kent state is that i was a junior in high school in my u.s. history class . i 'd always been a news junkie so i had been reading about the occurrence - about kent state in the papers , in life and magazine that came out that week . and i got into an argument with my high school history teacher because he was blaming the students , the syndrome you -one of your other callers mentioned . it was like there was this vast dichotomy if you were over 30 , the - it was the students ' fault . if you were under 30 , you looked at - at least i tried to read and be logical about it . and i thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always struck in my memory , one of the students killed was something like 300 or 400 yards away from the protest and was on his way to his - to a class and he was an rotc student that had nothing to do with the protest . and he was hit and killed . <p> mr. kahler : well , he was closer than that . yeah . yeah . but you 're absolutely right . the - we - the victims , were blamed for this , and that was primarily because in the late ' 60s and into the early ' 70s , the speeches by our political leaders who supported the war basically said that if you were against us , then you were a communist or you were a dirty hippy . and they used language to victimize people who disagreed with them . and the prevailing feeling on the part of most of the country when we got shot was that we deserved it because of the language that was used by our political leaders . <p> back then , we were - you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall meet . so they used that language to victimize students . <p> roberts : well , jack , mentioned that generational divide , and that 's mentioned in a lot of calls and emails we 're getting . debra(ph) in reno , nevada says , she remembers coming home from high school that afternoon and her mother was watching tv and ironing . when i realized what she was watching , i was horrified and started crying and asked why , why , why ? my mother said they were throwing rocks . that was a paradigm shift for me . our parents were not necessarily on our side anymore protecting us . many of them thought that murdering students was justified . <p> mr. kahler : well , a capital sentence or a capital punishment usually is reserved for our courts . when did the national guard and our political leaders give them the authority to execute students who disagreed with them ? yes , there were some students who were throwing stones . but if you look at the photographs , the national guard were doing the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had run out of tear gas and were returning the tear gas that was thrown at them and some were throwing the stones back at the students . but that does n't give the right of the law enforcement official in our country to execute students who were disagreeing with policies of our federal government . so , yes , there is a divide therein . <p> let us see . it goes around to the hate speech , the language that was being used . we have to be careful of the language we use . we see it today . the language of dealing with the abortion issue is very vitriolic and has led to many deaths . just the language around the health care reform bill led to congressmen being spit on when they were walking to the chamber . and , you know , we need to watch our language . i know our country has had a long history of using vitriolic language in political speech , but it does have consequences . <p> roberts : we have an email from lenny(ph) in lake worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also a member of the ohio national guard unit , although thanks be to god i was n't on active duty that day . because there were so many race riots going on , we were held in reserve . after the fact , i most certainly blame then governor rhodes for these deaths and injuries . dean kahler , how satisfied are you that there was justice served in the wake of the kent state shootings ? <p> mr. kahler : i 'm satisfied that we have much of the record that is public on record - we could get a hold of as public record . i 'm not satisfied with the lack of justice that we had . and yes , governor rhodes was one of the major perpetrators of this . and it not only affected those of us who got shot , but it affected a whole generation of students who went to kent state university in 1970 and had been labeled this . i know people who did n't get jobs just because they were a student at kent . and so it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has affected those who were there . and yes , governor rhodes has a tremendous amount of responsibility for this , and no , justice has not been served in this particular matter yet . <p> roberts : and what is planned on campus tomorrow ? <p> mr. kahler : there is the usual day of speeches , of commemoration and memoriam to the students who were killed , and we will dowse the candles at approximately the time of the shootings , around 12:20 or so . and then there are some other activities that are happening - i mean , just a whole host of things . i do n't have the schedule in front of me and i did n't memorize it . but it 's a day of mourning , a day of celebration at the same time , and a day of looking forward . and not only do we mention the students who were shot here at kent , but on the 15th of may , you know , students were killed in jackson state . <p> i remember lying in my bed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oh my , god . what is going on with this country ? are we going crazy or what ? and i just could n't believe it . it was probably one of the lowest periods of my time , coming so shortly after the shootings at kent state . it did n't make my recovery any easier . <p> roberts : dean kahler was a student at kent state university 40 years ago . he was shot and paralyzed during the student demonstration on may 4th . he joined us from member station wksu in kent , ohio . thank you so much . <p> mr. kahler : you 're welcome . <p> roberts : you 're listening to talk of the nation from npr news . and as dean kahler mentioned , 10 days after the kent state shooting , an eerily familiar tragedy played out on the campus of jackson state university in mississippi . police there fired on a group of students , killing two , hurting 12 others . gene young was a student on campus in 1970 . he 's now a civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now also from member station wksu in kent . <p> gene young , welcome to the program . <p> mr. gene young ( former professor , jackson state university ) : good afternoon . i 'm in kent also for the 40th anniversary commemoration of the killings at kent and jackson state . <p> roberts : we have had a couple of emails , including this one from sharon(ph) , who says , what disturbs me is that a similar incident at jackson state in florida did n't receive - she says florida , she means mississippi - did n't receive the similar media coverage . that has become one of the things talked about when people mention the jackson state incident . why do you think that it was n't sort of seared into public consciousness as kent state was ? <p> mr. young : on the surface , kent state was four white students in ohio . jackson state and orangeburg were black colleges in the south . two black students on a black college campus in mississippi that had the history of emmett till , medgar evers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of business as usual , racist law enforcement officials victimizing black people in mississippi . <p> roberts : can you tell us the story of what happened that day ? <p> mr. young : well , okay . well , to its credit , kent state is always included in jackson sate , so we never want to make cite and make you think that kent state is not respecting regarding what happened a few days after the tragedy on this campus . but students at jackson state campus on john roy lynch street in jackson , mississippi , was a major thoroughfare . and motorists would drive through the campus making racist epitaph , making secular innuendos against some of the black female students on that campus . <p> and things just came to a head when law enforcement officials marched onto the campus in front of alexander hall women 's dormitory . and shortly after midnight , a bottle broke on the pavement and law enforcement officials fired over 200 rounds of bullets into a women 's dormitory from the bottom floor to the top floor . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic , that only two students were killed that night - james earl green , a high school student at jim hill who was on his way home from a part-time job and philip lafayette gibbs , a junior , a pre-law major from ripley , mississippi , who was standing in front of the dormitory when the police opened fire without warning . <p> roberts : and what could you possibly tell students ? in the aftermath , how did you keep total chaos from erupting ? <p> mr. young : dr. john peoples , in his book \" to survive and thrive : the quest for a true university , \" credits me with coming on the scene immediately thereafter and start reciting some words that i had heard in washington , d.c. in 1963 , go back to mississippi . go back to alabama . go back to louisiana . go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities knowing that somehow the situation can and will be changed . let us not wallow in the valley of despair . and i say to you today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frustrations of the moment , i still have a dream . <p> those words and my voice had a calming effect on some of my fellow students who have been traumatized by the tragedy that just taken place on that campus . and i remember the blood-curling scream of mary gibbs when somebody told her it was her brother , phillip gibbs , who was one of the students who had been killed that evening . and we stayed out on the lawn of alexander dormitory until the sun came up singing freedom songs and continued to recite some of dr. king 's words throughout the night . <p> and the next morning , dr. peoples ended the semester at jackson state in 1970 . and some of us - many students went home but some of us stayed on to try to bring attention to what had happened on the campus of jackson state that morning . <p> roberts : gene young is a civil rights activist who was a jackson state student during the killings on may 14 , 1970 . he 's also a former professor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kent . thank you so much for joining us . <p> mr. young : thank you . <p> roberts : we owe a big thank you to wksu . they helped organize today 's program , as well as letting us use their studios and they shared the audio slideshow with stories and photos of that day . you can watch that slideshow on our website . go to npr.org and click on talk of the nation . <p> npr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by a contractor for npr , and accuracy and availability may vary . this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future . please be aware that the authoritative record of npr 's programming is the audio .

        "text":"<h> Features <h> Shrinking right : How Youngstown , Ohio , is miles ahead of Detroit <h> Related Tags <p> YOUNGSTOWN , Ohio -- By the summer of 2002 , Youngstown had lost more than 100,000 residents , more than half of its population just a few decades earlier . The city had convened focus groups of community stakeholders to find a way out . Common themes came up in these groups : We 're not the Youngstown we used to be ; we wo n't be that Youngstown ever again ; and we need to shrink to survive . <p> Does that sound familiar , Detroit ? <p> A few months later , a few days before Christmas , leaders planned a citywide meeting , co-convened by Youngstown State University President David Sweet and then Mayor George McKelvey . It was to be the culmination of the focus group work . City hall had no idea how many people would actually show up . They thought a few hundred people would be a success . <p> Youngstown aggressively promoted the event , which would take place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood that was once known for its steel barons but was becoming known for its vacancies . <p> The city took out ads calling everyone to the meeting --- the cynics , the pessimists , the optimists -- and used frank language , booking this as the last , best chance to save Youngstown from irrelevance . The ads reminded people that others called Youngstown \" miserable \" and \" dying , \" words with which we Detroiters are quite familiar . <p> And even though it was freezing that night , the people came . They piled in , one after another , after another . In the end , 1,400 people showed up , curious to hear what could be done to change their city . <p> Why Youngstown and Detroit <p> Youngstown is smaller . Four Youngstowns could fit inside one Detroit . Its population would have to be multiplied by 12 to match the Motor City 's . What lessons could Youngstown possibly offer us ? It turns out , there is a lot to glean from the city 's experiences . <p> \" What is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the Great Lakes region everywhere , \" says Hunter Morrison , director of the Center for Urban and Regional Studies at Youngstown State . \" Detroit is not alone , and it 's not failure . ... Detroit is so much like Youngstown . \" <p> Both cities face very real and very similar problems . A single industry powered each city 's rise , and each has seen that industry decline dramatically . Both have seen their populations shrink while vacancies increase . Both are dealing with tough revenue , crime and school issues . Yet , at the same time , both have deeply passionate people working to improve their cities at all costs . <p> The cities ' story lines start out similarly . \" You can take ' Youngstown ' out and plug in ' Detroit , ' \" says Youngstown Mayor Jay Williams . \" You can take out ' steel ' and plug in ' cars . ' \" <p> What comes next is different . While , for the most part , Detroit has sat idling , Youngstown has put a finger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started dealing with them . <p> Detroit has no right-sizing plan . In Mayor Dave Bing 's State of the City address in March , he acknowledged this , saying : \" We have lacked a true vision and viable plan in Detroit for decades . \" He 's talked about a plan , but revealed nothing aside from demolition . <p> With its Youngstown 2010 plan and strong vision from city leadership , this small Ohio city , on the other hand , has had a big head start , and it 's starting to work . <p> It happened one night <p> At the time of that 2002 December meeting , Williams was the director of Youngstown 's community development agency . \" The spark was lit that night , \" he says . \" It was December , it was cold , it was close to Christmas . The meeting was supposed to be an hour and a half long . We were there for three hours . We listened to ( the audience ) . They vented . <p> \" If I had to pick the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that building , it was that night , \" the mayor says . <p> The audience was n't shy . Most were sick of the vacancies , of the decline , tired of waiting for Youngstown to change , to do something . Years before , they had been told there could be a defense contractor coming in to save the city , then there was talk of a new factory , and some were still waiting for the steel mills to open back up . <p> \" We were a community in waiting , \" says Bill D'Avignon , director of city planning for Youngstown . \" We were waiting for that knight in shining armor , waiting for a blimp factory to come and save us . \" <p> The vision unveiled at the meeting went to city council and passed 7-0 . This would become the impetus for Youngstown 2010 , a citywide , community-engaged plan for Youngstown 's future -- a future with roughly 70,000 people ( or less ) , not the 170,000 who lived there at the height of its boom , nor the 250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The bones of the plan are cemented on four tenets : accept that Youngstown is a smaller city ; define Youngstown 's role in the new regional economy ; improve Youngstown 's image and enhance quality of life ; and a put out a call to action . <p> The tenets are n't exactly mind blowing . Youngstown has n't loaded the chamber with silver bullets , but at least they 've had clear targets . Youngstowners also approved , by 74 percent , a city charter amendment that says the city has to revisit and reassess the plan every 10 years , after the Census . Youngstown 2010 is a roadmap . <p> Here darlin ' in Youngstown <p> Youngstown had a plan in the 1950s . Sitting atop the powerful steel industry , Youngstown expected to hit 250,000 people , and the city built out infrastructure to accommodate that number . The plan was revised in 1974 , three years before Youngstown Sheet and Tube -- one of the largest steel mills in the world -- closed , furloughing 5,000 jobs in a weekend . Locals call that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next four years , would see more and more steel plants close and 40,000 manufacturing jobs disappear . <p> The last Census had Youngstown 's population at 82,000 . This year 's Census will have that number even lower . \" I tend to think ( the population of Youngstown ) will be close to 65,000 , \" says Tom Finnerty Jr. , associate director for YSU 's Center for Urban and Regional studies and lead writer for the Youngstown 2010 plan . \" We 'll be hard pressed to hit 70,000 that 's for sure . \" <p> About 43 percent of Youngstown 's land is vacant ; and , as of January of last year , Youngstown had 4,500 vacant structures throughout the city . <p> \" Shrinking is un-American in a way , \" Morrison says . Urban areas , by nature , are about growing either up or out . Size and population define cities . <p> But does bigger define quality of life ? The Youngstowners said no . \" Acceptance was the most significant part of that plan , \" Morrison says . \" Accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \" <p> \" Smaller does n't mean giving up . And ( Youngstown ) started to see that , \" Williams says . \" This is a community with a great heart that has been defined by failure because of its one industry . The industry that made us great no longer existed in the way it did . But we did n't have to be ashamed of that . We were the butt of jokes and we were sick of it . \" <p> And no one was waiting in the wings to save them . <p> \" D.C. is n't going to come in and help us , \" he continues . \" Maybe they 'll play a role but that was n't going to happen . There was n't going to be a blimp factory or some defense firm coming in . It was just us and we were doing something about it . \" <p> Community engagement <p> The Youngstown 2010 plan came together in January 2005 , a little more than two years after the vision was unveiled . An audience of 1,300 was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to this was spent educating and reinforcing the community with the tenants of the vision and enforcing the importance of having a solid plan . <p> Youngstown 's 31 neighborhoods were grouped into 11 clusters , and meetings were held in each cluster . Attendance was high . Everything was transparent , and it was all on the table . <p> \" Collaboration was key to this entire process , \" says Williams . It was important that this was n't just a city plan . It needed to be a plan brought on by the people , enforced by the people , with city facilitation . And , that 's exactly what they got . \" From the city leaders to Youngstown State to the community , it was a 180-degree turn , \" Williams adds . \" This was n't going to be another run of the mill city plan . This was going to engage . \" <p> \" The planning process was very important part of how we did it , \" says Morrison . \" There was a lot of suspicion of politics . Involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil Kidd agreed . \" They allowed honest discourse , to talk about the obvious problems in every neighborhood . \" Kidd had started a \" Defend Youngstown \" campaign to , well , you get the picture . <p> A plan and a lot of land <p> But where does the heart of Youngstown 2010 lie ? A plan that rethinks a city , let alone shrinks one , is complex , multi-faceted and damn hard to pin down . <p> Beyond trying to diversify its economy , it is about Youngstown 's land , namely what to do with the oversized infrastructure , 4,500 vacant structures , and 43 percent vacant land . Ring any bells , Detroit ? <p> In Williams ' first term , he demoed more abandoned houses than the previous four years combined . Youngstown , on average , had been allotting $300,000 toward demos , dropping 150 houses a year . Between 2006 and 2010 , Williams has averaged a $1 million demo budget , bringing down 370 abandoned , unsafe structures . <p> In addition , the administration also made a point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was strategic . And removing that blight built confidence in the neighborhood , \" Williams says . <p> Fresh dirt <p> Freshly demoed lots are visible throughout the neighborhoods of Youngstown . But that 's not the goal . An empty lot is better than blight , but something constructive is better than an empty lot . For example , major blight is hard to come by along Market Street , heading toward downtown . Manicured lots with flowers , trees and rocks dot this main artery where there was once blight and abandonment . <p> The urban agriculture movement is growing there , too . Grow Youngstown not only advocates for urban agriculture , it also distributes fresh , local produce to underserved neighborhoods in the city . In a neighborhood in the south end of Youngstown called Idora , an urban 4H club was started . The neighborhood association , in partnership with the Youngstown Neighborhood Development Corp . ( YNDC ) , is working toward creating a block-long urban garden that once was covered with blight ( among other things ) . <p> Additionally , YSU has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east side into a wetlands mitigation bank . Parts of the east side look as if roads were laid over a forest and someone forgot to build the houses . <p> Youngstown still has a lot of neighborhood blight to tackle .

        "lower_text":"<h> features <h> shrinking right : how youngstown , ohio , is miles ahead of detroit <h> related tags <p> youngstown , ohio -- by the summer of 2002 , youngstown had lost more than 100,000 residents , more than half of its population just a few decades earlier . the city had convened focus groups of community stakeholders to find a way out . common themes came up in these groups : we 're not the youngstown we used to be ; we wo n't be that youngstown ever again ; and we need to shrink to survive . <p> does that sound familiar , detroit ? <p> a few months later , a few days before christmas , leaders planned a citywide meeting , co-convened by youngstown state university president david sweet and then mayor george mckelvey . it was to be the culmination of the focus group work . city hall had no idea how many people would actually show up . they thought a few hundred people would be a success . <p> youngstown aggressively promoted the event , which would take place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood that was once known for its steel barons but was becoming known for its vacancies . <p> the city took out ads calling everyone to the meeting --- the cynics , the pessimists , the optimists -- and used frank language , booking this as the last , best chance to save youngstown from irrelevance . the ads reminded people that others called youngstown \" miserable \" and \" dying , \" words with which we detroiters are quite familiar . <p> and even though it was freezing that night , the people came . they piled in , one after another , after another . in the end , 1,400 people showed up , curious to hear what could be done to change their city . <p> why youngstown and detroit <p> youngstown is smaller . four youngstowns could fit inside one detroit . its population would have to be multiplied by 12 to match the motor city 's . what lessons could youngstown possibly offer us ? it turns out , there is a lot to glean from the city 's experiences . <p> \" what is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the great lakes region everywhere , \" says hunter morrison , director of the center for urban and regional studies at youngstown state . \" detroit is not alone , and it 's not failure . ... detroit is so much like youngstown . \" <p> both cities face very real and very similar problems . a single industry powered each city 's rise , and each has seen that industry decline dramatically . both have seen their populations shrink while vacancies increase . both are dealing with tough revenue , crime and school issues . yet , at the same time , both have deeply passionate people working to improve their cities at all costs . <p> the cities ' story lines start out similarly . \" you can take ' youngstown ' out and plug in ' detroit , ' \" says youngstown mayor jay williams . \" you can take out ' steel ' and plug in ' cars . ' \" <p> what comes next is different . while , for the most part , detroit has sat idling , youngstown has put a finger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started dealing with them . <p> detroit has no right-sizing plan . in mayor dave bing 's state of the city address in march , he acknowledged this , saying : \" we have lacked a true vision and viable plan in detroit for decades . \" he 's talked about a plan , but revealed nothing aside from demolition . <p> with its youngstown 2010 plan and strong vision from city leadership , this small ohio city , on the other hand , has had a big head start , and it 's starting to work . <p> it happened one night <p> at the time of that 2002 december meeting , williams was the director of youngstown 's community development agency . \" the spark was lit that night , \" he says . \" it was december , it was cold , it was close to christmas . the meeting was supposed to be an hour and a half long . we were there for three hours . we listened to ( the audience ) . they vented . <p> \" if i had to pick the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that building , it was that night , \" the mayor says . <p> the audience was n't shy . most were sick of the vacancies , of the decline , tired of waiting for youngstown to change , to do something . years before , they had been told there could be a defense contractor coming in to save the city , then there was talk of a new factory , and some were still waiting for the steel mills to open back up . <p> \" we were a community in waiting , \" says bill d'avignon , director of city planning for youngstown . \" we were waiting for that knight in shining armor , waiting for a blimp factory to come and save us . \" <p> the vision unveiled at the meeting went to city council and passed 7-0 . this would become the impetus for youngstown 2010 , a citywide , community-engaged plan for youngstown 's future -- a future with roughly 70,000 people ( or less ) , not the 170,000 who lived there at the height of its boom , nor the 250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the bones of the plan are cemented on four tenets : accept that youngstown is a smaller city ; define youngstown 's role in the new regional economy ; improve youngstown 's image and enhance quality of life ; and a put out a call to action . <p> the tenets are n't exactly mind blowing . youngstown has n't loaded the chamber with silver bullets , but at least they 've had clear targets . youngstowners also approved , by 74 percent , a city charter amendment that says the city has to revisit and reassess the plan every 10 years , after the census . youngstown 2010 is a roadmap . <p> here darlin ' in youngstown <p> youngstown had a plan in the 1950s . sitting atop the powerful steel industry , youngstown expected to hit 250,000 people , and the city built out infrastructure to accommodate that number . the plan was revised in 1974 , three years before youngstown sheet and tube -- one of the largest steel mills in the world -- closed , furloughing 5,000 jobs in a weekend . locals call that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next four years , would see more and more steel plants close and 40,000 manufacturing jobs disappear . <p> the last census had youngstown 's population at 82,000 . this year 's census will have that number even lower . \" i tend to think ( the population of youngstown ) will be close to 65,000 , \" says tom finnerty jr. , associate director for ysu 's center for urban and regional studies and lead writer for the youngstown 2010 plan . \" we 'll be hard pressed to hit 70,000 that 's for sure . \" <p> about 43 percent of youngstown 's land is vacant ; and , as of january of last year , youngstown had 4,500 vacant structures throughout the city . <p> \" shrinking is un-american in a way , \" morrison says . urban areas , by nature , are about growing either up or out . size and population define cities . <p> but does bigger define quality of life ? the youngstowners said no . \" acceptance was the most significant part of that plan , \" morrison says . \" accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \" <p> \" smaller does n't mean giving up . and ( youngstown ) started to see that , \" williams says . \" this is a community with a great heart that has been defined by failure because of its one industry . the industry that made us great no longer existed in the way it did . but we did n't have to be ashamed of that . we were the butt of jokes and we were sick of it . \" <p> and no one was waiting in the wings to save them . <p> \" d.c. is n't going to come in and help us , \" he continues . \" maybe they 'll play a role but that was n't going to happen . there was n't going to be a blimp factory or some defense firm coming in . it was just us and we were doing something about it . \" <p> community engagement <p> the youngstown 2010 plan came together in january 2005 , a little more than two years after the vision was unveiled . an audience of 1,300 was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to this was spent educating and reinforcing the community with the tenants of the vision and enforcing the importance of having a solid plan . <p> youngstown 's 31 neighborhoods were grouped into 11 clusters , and meetings were held in each cluster . attendance was high . everything was transparent , and it was all on the table . <p> \" collaboration was key to this entire process , \" says williams . it was important that this was n't just a city plan . it needed to be a plan brought on by the people , enforced by the people , with city facilitation . and , that 's exactly what they got . \" from the city leaders to youngstown state to the community , it was a 180-degree turn , \" williams adds . \" this was n't going to be another run of the mill city plan . this was going to engage . \" <p> \" the planning process was very important part of how we did it , \" says morrison . \" there was a lot of suspicion of politics . involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phil kidd agreed . \" they allowed honest discourse , to talk about the obvious problems in every neighborhood . \" kidd had started a \" defend youngstown \" campaign to , well , you get the picture . <p> a plan and a lot of land <p> but where does the heart of youngstown 2010 lie ? a plan that rethinks a city , let alone shrinks one , is complex , multi-faceted and damn hard to pin down . <p> beyond trying to diversify its economy , it is about youngstown 's land , namely what to do with the oversized infrastructure , 4,500 vacant structures , and 43 percent vacant land . ring any bells , detroit ? <p> in williams ' first term , he demoed more abandoned houses than the previous four years combined . youngstown , on average , had been allotting $300,000 toward demos , dropping 150 houses a year . between 2006 and 2010 , williams has averaged a $1 million demo budget , bringing down 370 abandoned , unsafe structures . <p> in addition , the administration also made a point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was strategic . and removing that blight built confidence in the neighborhood , \" williams says . <p> fresh dirt <p> freshly demoed lots are visible throughout the neighborhoods of youngstown . but that 's not the goal . an empty lot is better than blight , but something constructive is better than an empty lot . for example , major blight is hard to come by along market street , heading toward downtown . manicured lots with flowers , trees and rocks dot this main artery where there was once blight and abandonment . <p> the urban agriculture movement is growing there , too . grow youngstown not only advocates for urban agriculture , it also distributes fresh , local produce to underserved neighborhoods in the city . in a neighborhood in the south end of youngstown called idora , an urban 4h club was started . the neighborhood association , in partnership with the youngstown neighborhood development corp .

        "text":"<h> Related Links <p> Natasha moved to Chicago from Eastern Europe a year and a half ago with a visa and a vision of what America would be like . But that vision quickly disintegrated . <p> The nanny job she had secured turned ugly when they stopped paying her on time and started asking her to do things she was n't comfortable with . Finally , feeling as though she had no other options , she quit and started the job search anew . <p> \" The job was not working at all , \" said Natasha , who requested her real name be withheld . \" But then I had no money and I got desperate because I did n't want to leave . \" <p> One of her Eastern European friends mentioned a Chicago-area spa owner who was hiring masseuses and provided great perks : a free apartment , a car and a job . So she decided to give it a try . But things went downhill , again . <p> \" After a few months he stopped paying me , \" she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do what he said . He would hit me . I was so scared . He told me if I tried to escape he would find me . \" <p> The business only employed Eastern European girls , both legal and illegal . Natasha said he was sexually and physically abusive . <p> \" We were n't allowed to talk to each other or anyone else , \" she said . \" We were trapped . \" <p> Natasha was afraid to approach the police -- she did n't know how they would react or whether they could help her . And she was afraid of getting sent back to Europe , even though she still had a valid visa . <p> Natasha is not alone . Many immigrants , legal and otherwise , are afraid to approach the police or report crimes against them , said Richard Hanus , a Chicago area immigration lawyer . <p> \" It 's a new system , a new society , and in addition to being intimidated and overwhelmed , there 's a shame that also comes with being victimized , \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself or people in your community that you have been taken . \" <p> It 's especially scary for immigrants when the crime involves their employment , said Dianne Enriquez , worker center network coordinator for Interfaith Worker Justice . The national group organizes a network of low-wage worker groups for non-union sectors . <p> There were about 1.4 million worker-aged immigrants in 2008 , according to the Brookings Institute , a Washington , D.C.-based think tank . <p> With the encouragement of an American friend , Natasha fled her situation and went to the police . She also persuaded fellow workers to come forward and tell their story . <p> Her boss , Alex A. Campbell , and his associate Danielle John allegedly demanded thousands of dollars from a spa worker for help with her immigration papers and threatened her with other punishments if she did not pay more than $30,000 total . <p> In the case , U.S. v. Campbell and John , Natasha 's former boss and co-worker face charges of conspiring and attempting to commit extortion , according to a Jan. 13 press release from U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the case . The attorney for Campbell , Hal Garfinkel , was out of town and unable to be reached for comment ; John 's attorney , Christina Farley Jackson , was also unable to be reached for comment . <p> And now that Natasha 's former boss is in prison and awaiting a June 2 hearing , she feels safer . <p> They helped her find a safe place to stay , determine her immigration status and feel more secure , she said . <p> She is waiting to obtain a U-visa , a victim visa for witnesses in criminal cases . U-visas are not well-known by immigrants but they can safeguard victims wary of approaching the police , Hanus said , and are especially useful in situations when immigrants are nervous about their immigration status . <p> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS <p> The fear of seeking help is even greater for illegal immigrants , said Maureen Rowley Barnett , a Chicago psychologist that specializes in immigration issues . They live in a constant state of anxiety and are often targeted by criminals and other offenders because they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of the price that they would pay is great enough to keep them away from the police and anything to do with the law , \" she said . <p> Hanus agreed . Though without visas they do not necessarily have the right to stay here , illegal immigrants do have the constitutional rights to safety and property just like any American , he said . <p> And \" police are charged with the responsibility of protecting you no less than protecting a person that is documented , \" he said . <p> Though most situations are not as dramatic as Natasha 's , worker abuse is widespread among immigrants , experts said . <p> Wage theft , discrimination and abuse are the main problems seen at Interfaith Worker Justice , Enriquez said . <p> She has heard stories of employees not allowed to use the restroom or being forced to relieve themselves outside . Construction , restaurant and domestic workers most often face these situations , she said . <p> Elena , who also did n't want her real name used , is an illegal immigrant who was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is fighting wage theft against two previous employers with the help of ARISE Chicago Worker Center . The organization provided her with the knowledge of her rights that gave her the confidence to fight , she said . <p> \" I did n't have any fear , \" she said . \" If they 're going to deport me they will . \" <p> A job at a local restaurant promised her $300 for 12 hours a day , six days a week .

        "title":"The Risks of Fiction: On The New Yorker Writers Under 40 List\n",
        "text":"<h> The Risks of Fiction : On The New Yorker Writers Under 40 List <p> Back in 2003 , I decided to start reading the fiction in The New Yorker consistently . Up until that point , I 'd read the weekly fiction offering only if it happened to be something by a writer I particularly liked . <p> Part of my motivation had to do with my own ambitions as a fiction writer ; another part had to do with my high school teaching job , which included a course in Reading and Writing Fiction . I thought maybe , by studying closely what the magazine was publishing , I 'd get a better sense of just why my own stories were getting unceremoniously rejected everywhere I sent them ( with the minor exception of a brief but kind note scribbled at the bottom of a form rejection from McSweeney 's . ) If not , at least I 'd maybe come away with some good stories to teach in class . <p> In the first few months of the project , I encountered some great pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( an excerpt from his novel Old School ) , Maile Meloy 's \" Red From Green , \" and Lara Vapnyar 's \" Love Lessons , Mondays , 8 a.m . \" And I found that , having preemptively committed myself to reading each story , I sat down with a helpful patience , an openness to the experience and to the writer 's art . <p> The summer of that first year , I went back to an old issue I 'd kept tucked away on a shelf -- the one dated June 21 &amp; 28 , 1999 . This issue was designed by rock-star book designer Chip Kidd . ( Incidentally , it 's the only issue in the magazine 's history whose pages have artwork that bleeds to the edges . ) The cover features an illustration of Chris Ware 's character Jimmy Corrigan on a beach , looking out at the sea . Scrolled down the page are twenty first sentences -- from stories written by the twenty authors chosen to represent what editor Bill Buford , in his introductory comment , called \" the twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names and the not-so-obvious , those who are only just now crossing a threshold of literary recognition and those who have been at home in it for some time . \" <p> I 'd dipped into this issue when it first came out . I had liked the Sherman Alexiepiece and the David Foster Wallaceone , but set the magazine aside after being unmoved by a couple of the others . Now , though , I dug back in and found more to like -- a tense and mysterious story by Chang-Rae Lee , a wicked little one by Antonya Nelson , and soberly masterful stories by Edwidge Danticat and Jhumpa Lahiri . I found that the issue included an excerpt from Tony Earley 's gentle , pitch-perfect Jim the Boy , a novel which I 'd read and loved . <p> Over the next seven years , I continued to read the New Yorker fiction fairly regularly . Some years I read more or less everything , while other years I took in only about half of the stories . I began to catalog my reactions in a spreadsheet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I made up enough bonus-reading quizzes on stories I liked that I was able to offer one per day to my Reading and Writing Fiction students . I sat down and formulated my own criteria for evaluating fiction . I branched out into other sources of fiction , subscribing to smaller magazines like Epoch , The Gettysburg Review , and the Virginia Quarterly Review . <p> I came to recognize , though , that reading magazine fiction is a crapshoot . I think that 's why many New Yorker readers rarely read this part of the magazine . When you read a piece of nonfiction , you know what you 're getting into , and you know you 'll come away from the experience with something tangible -- some information or perspective on the world . And you can stop midway through and still have something to take with you . Fiction does n't work that way , at least for me . It 's like sex -- uncomfortable if abandoned midway through . The rewards of fiction -- the ecstatic transport when you 're pulled into the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- can be greater than those of nonfiction , but you can also finish a story angry that the writer has just wasted 45 minutes of your life that you 'll never get back . <p> Given the risks involved in reading a piece of fiction , it helps to have someone whose taste you trust to limit the pool . Larry Dark became that type of guide for me in the O. Henry Prize collections from 1997 to 2002 , which include dozens of stories that blew me away . The New Yorker fiction editors serve the same purpose . Though I do n't dispute that stories are published in smaller magazines that I would like better than a healthy percentage of the stories published in The New Yorker , I simply do n't have time to read all those little magazines . The New Yorker 's batting average is high enough -- and it publishes enough heavy-hitters -- that it 's as good a section as any to stand in if you hope to catch a home run . <p> As the literary critic Barbara Herrnstein Smith has argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arbitrariness on both a personal and a society-wide level . Yet we naturally make such judgments . We have to do so , simply to avoid being drowned by the deluge of written material that swamps us . Our literary judgments also help us define ourselves and our culture . Who am I ? What do I like , and why ? What vision of the world do I share ? And who are we ? What do we value ? What stories do we want to hear about ourselves , what will our culture admit into its awareness ? <p> So that 's the context in which I 'm approaching this week 's New Yorker , in which the fiction editors offer , eleven years later , a new group of 20 writers , all under 40 years of age , as the future of fiction in America . It 's an effort to shape a literary culture . And it 's an effort by people whose taste I generally trust . <p> Overall , though , the new list does n't immediately excite me , I must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stories that I greatly admire , and several of the others have written stories that I thought were good . But , to return to the sexual metaphor of reading fiction , with some of the other writers on the list I 've had one-night stands and never hooked up again . Others , sad to say , have fallen victim to episodes of literary coitus interruptus . <p> The fact is , this past year I 've gotten a bit impatient with New Yorker fiction . Busy with other reading projects , I 've slipped back into my old habits -- reading onlystories whose authors particularly grabbed my interest . <p> But -- and this is another danger of magazine fiction -- it 's all too easy to misjudge a writer harshly simply on the basis of one story . Like the 1999 issue , this one , I hope , will redirect my attention to worthy writers whom I may have unfairly written off . <p> Despite the periodic disappointments of reading fiction in magazines , there 's a unique magic to the experience . There 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers . There 's the joy of beginning a story by a writer you 've never read and suddenly realizing that you 're encountering something great . It 's like being struck by lightning , set suddenly afire with pleasure . No other reading experience can turn a chance hour into sheer delight in quite this way . <p> Say what you will , The New Yorker is one of our culture 's most stalwart curators of this type of literary experience . For that reason , its editors ' vision of the future of fiction is worth considering . It 's my hope that , like the 1999 issue , the 2010 version will include some surprising treats that open up new readerly enthusiasms for me . <h> Post a Response <p> Comments with unrelated links will be deleted . If you 'd like to reach our readers , consider buying an advertisement instead . <p> Anonymous and pseudonymous comments that do not add to the conversation will be deleted at our discretion . <p> NameE-mailWebsite ( optional ) Comment <p> The rewards of fiction can be greater than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're pulled into the world of a story , given a new window into human experience -- but you can also come away from a story angry that the writer has just wasted 45 minutes of your life .

( incidentally , it 's the only issue in the magazine 's history whose pages have artwork that bleeds to the edges . ) the cover features an illustration of chris ware 's character jimmy corrigan on a beach , looking out at the sea . scrolled down the page are twenty first sentences -- from stories written by the twenty authors chosen to represent what editor bill buford , in his introductory comment , called \" the twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names and the not-so-obvious , those who are only just now crossing a threshold of literary recognition and those who have been at home in it for some time . \" <p> i 'd dipped into this issue when it first came out . i had liked the sherman alexiepiece and the david foster wallaceone , but set the magazine aside after being unmoved by a couple of the others . now , though , i dug back in and found more to like -- a tense and mysterious story by chang-rae lee , a wicked little one by antonya nelson , and soberly masterful stories by edwidge danticat and jhumpa lahiri . i found that the issue included an excerpt from tony earley 's gentle , pitch-perfect jim the boy , a novel which i 'd read and loved . <p> over the next seven years , i continued to read the new yorker fiction fairly regularly . some years i read more or less everything , while other years i took in only about half of the stories . i began to catalog my reactions in a spreadsheet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . i made up enough bonus-reading quizzes on stories i liked that i was able to offer one per day to my reading and writing fiction students . i sat down and formulated my own criteria for evaluating fiction . i branched out into other sources of fiction , subscribing to smaller magazines like epoch , the gettysburg review , and the virginia quarterly review . <p> i came to recognize , though , that reading magazine fiction is a crapshoot . i think that 's why many new yorker readers rarely read this part of the magazine . when you read a piece of nonfiction , you know what you 're getting into , and you know you 'll come away from the experience with something tangible -- some information or perspective on the world . and you can stop midway through and still have something to take with you . fiction does n't work that way , at least for me . it 's like sex -- uncomfortable if abandoned midway through . the rewards of fiction -- the ecstatic transport when you 're pulled into the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- can be greater than those of nonfiction , but you can also finish a story angry that the writer has just wasted 45 minutes of your life that you 'll never get back . <p> given the risks involved in reading a piece of fiction , it helps to have someone whose taste you trust to limit the pool . larry dark became that type of guide for me in the o. henry prize collections from 1997 to 2002 , which include dozens of stories that blew me away . the new yorker fiction editors serve the same purpose . though i do n't dispute that stories are published in smaller magazines that i would like better than a healthy percentage of the stories published in the new yorker , i simply do n't have time to read all those little magazines . the new yorker 's batting average is high enough -- and it publishes enough heavy-hitters -- that it 's as good a section as any to stand in if you hope to catch a home run . <p> as the literary critic barbara herrnstein smith has argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arbitrariness on both a personal and a society-wide level . yet we naturally make such judgments . we have to do so , simply to avoid being drowned by the deluge of written material that swamps us . our literary judgments also help us define ourselves and our culture . who am i ? what do i like , and why ? what vision of the world do i share ? and who are we ? what do we value ? what stories do we want to hear about ourselves , what will our culture admit into its awareness ? <p> so that 's the context in which i 'm approaching this week 's new yorker , in which the fiction editors offer , eleven years later , a new group of 20 writers , all under 40 years of age , as the future of fiction in america . it 's an effort to shape a literary culture . and it 's an effort by people whose taste i generally trust . <p> overall , though , the new list does n't immediately excite me , i must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stories that i greatly admire , and several of the others have written stories that i thought were good . but , to return to the sexual metaphor of reading fiction , with some of the other writers on the list i 've had one-night stands and never hooked up again . others , sad to say , have fallen victim to episodes of literary coitus interruptus . <p> the fact is , this past year i 've gotten a bit impatient with new yorker fiction . busy with other reading projects , i 've slipped back into my old habits -- reading onlystories whose authors particularly grabbed my interest . <p> but -- and this is another danger of magazine fiction -- it 's all too easy to misjudge a writer harshly simply on the basis of one story . like the 1999 issue , this one , i hope , will redirect my attention to worthy writers whom i may have unfairly written off . <p> despite the periodic disappointments of reading fiction in magazines , there 's a unique magic to the experience . there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers . there 's the joy of beginning a story by a writer you 've never read and suddenly realizing that you 're encountering something great . it 's like being struck by lightning , set suddenly afire with pleasure . no other reading experience can turn a chance hour into sheer delight in quite this way . <p> say what you will , the new yorker is one of our culture 's most stalwart curators of this type of literary experience . for that reason , its editors ' vision of the future of fiction is worth considering . it 's my hope that , like the 1999 issue , the 2010 version will include some surprising treats that open up new readerly enthusiasms for me . <h> post a response <p> comments with unrelated links will be deleted . if you 'd like to reach our readers , consider buying an advertisement instead . <p> anonymous and pseudonymous comments that do not add to the conversation will be deleted at our discretion . <p> namee-mailwebsite ( optional ) comment <p> the rewards of fiction can be greater than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're pulled into the world of a story , given a new window into human experience -- but you can also come away from a story angry that the writer has just wasted 45 minutes of your life .

        "text":"<p> An 18-month median follow-up clinical trial has revealed superior efficacy with Tarigna ( nilotinib ) capsules in comparison to Gleevec ( imatinib mesylate ) tablets in adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML ( Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia ) in chronic phase 1 . Tasigna produced considerably deeper levels of molecular response than Gleevec in front-line Ph+ CML and lessened progression to accelerated phase and blast crisis , resulting in a lower number of deaths due to CML1 . Of note , three times more patients achieved undetectable disease at the molecular level with Tasigna compared to Gleevec1 Additionally , Tasigna surpassed Gleevec in other important measures of treatment efficacy . <p> Richard Larson , MD , ENESTnd study investigator and Director of the Hematologic Malignancies Program at the University of Chicago , said : <p> Tasigna demonstrates that by more selectively inhibiting BCR-ABL , the key driver of Ph+ CML , we can reduce progression to advanced disease even further than with the current gold standard Gleevec . The efficacy and safety findings achieved by Tasigna in this study provide patients and physicians with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was major molecular response ( MMR ) at 12 months ; a secondary endpoint was complete cytogenetic response ( CCyR ) by 12 months . Planned follow-up is for five years . <p> Patients on the Gleevec treatment arm who had suboptimal response or treatment failure were allowed to escalate dose and\/or switch to Tasigna via a protocol extension . The data presented at ASCO was the 18-month median follow-up . <p> MMR ( major molecular response ) was defined in the study as reduction in the level of the abnormal BCR-ABL gene to less than or equal to 0.1% of the pretreatment level based on an internationally agreed standard . <p> At the 18-month median follow-up , three times more patients in the ENESTnd study achieved undetectable disease at the molecular level ( BCR-ABL levels at 4.5-log reduction ) with Tasigna than with Gleevec . CCyR indicates that no CML cells containing the diagnostic Philadelphia chromosome can be seen in a sample of bone marrow taken from the patient . Results showed that fewer patients progressed to accelerated phase or blast crisis on Tasigna at 300 mg twice daily ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n = 1 ) versus Gleevec at 400 mg once daily ( n = 12 ) 1 with 18 months of median follow-up , demonstrating an improvement in disease control . Results also revealed fewer deaths due to CML on Tasigna at 300 mg twice daily ( n = 2 ) and 400 mg twice daily ( n = 1 ) versus Gleevec at 400 mg once daily ( n = 8 ) . Rate of MMR and CCyR remain better for Tasigna compared to Gleevec at the 18-month median follow-up . All patients had at least 16 months of treatment or discontinued early ; the median follow-up was 18 months . Overall , 80% , 81% and 75% of patients remained in the study on Tasigna 300 mg twice daily , Tasigna 400 mg twice daily and Gleevec 400 mg once daily , respectively . Tasigna and Gleevec were both well tolerated overall . Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events or laboratory abnormalities were : <p> Fewer patients taking Tasigna discontinued due to adverse events versus Gleevec . No patients in the study had prolongation of QT interval &gt;500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment arms . <p> A disease in which the body produces cancerous white blood cells . The vast majority of CML patients have an abnormality known as Philadelphia chromosome , which produces BCR-ABL . BCR-ABL is a protein that causes malignant white blood cells to reproduce .

        "text":"<h> Week 36 : Ray Stevens , Jester Of The Tea Party Set <p> A.V. Club head writer and hip-hop specialist Nathan Rabin recently decided to spend a year or two immersing himself in the canon of country music , a genre he knew little about , but was keen to explore . The result : \" Nashville Or Bust , \" a series of essays about seminal country artists . After 52 entries , Rabin plans to travel south and explore some of country music 's most hallowed landmarks and institutions . <p> I 've been a comedy obsessive since my dad gave me a copy of Woody Allen 's Without Feathers when I was 10 . \" Weird Al \" Yankovic was my first idol , and the inspiration for my ill-fated third-grade novelty band Nathan &amp; The Rockers . And yet I did n't really get into audio comedy until a few years ago . Now my iPod is full of comedy albums from folks like Bob Newhart , Woody Allen , Patton Oswalt , Jim Gaffigan , Demetri Martin , plus at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comedy Death-Ray , Never Not Funny , and The Best Show On WFMU With Tom Scharpling . <p> So when I saw a A.V. Clubnewswire post about country cut-up Ray Stevens scoring a big comeback with an anti-immigration song I figured now would be the perfect time to immerse myself in the music , the magic , and the wonder of the most successful country novelty act of all time . It was as if fate itself was admonishing me to explore the evolution of the man behind such timeless apogees of sophisticated comedy as \" Ahab The Arab . \" <p> I 'd long been fascinated by Stevens as a cultural figure , a sad-faced clown whose goofball oeuvre reflects the cultural zeitgeist . During the three weeks or so when streaking constituted the hottest fad , Stevens raced into the studio and released the instantly dated novelty smash \" The Streak . \" When the Twin Towers fell , Stevens responded with \" Osama Yo ' Mama . \" And when the election of President Obama drove the right wing to dress up like founding fathers in a misguided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles that made it great , Stevens cannily reinvented himself as the jester of the Tea Party set , a real-life Bob Roberts . <p> Stevens was n't always defined by his politics . Throughout the ' 60s and ' 70s , he was a respected Nashville professional , A&amp;R man , busy session musician , producer , and songwriter who worked with titans like Dolly Parton and Elvis Presley . As a recording artist , Stevens specialized in silly novelty songs like \" Gitarzan , \" but he was also the first artist to record Kris Kristofferson 's hangover classic \" Sunday Mornin ' Comin ' Down . \" Some of Stevens ' biggest hits , like \" Everything Is Beautiful , \" were maudlin and sentimental instead of goofy and ridiculous . But on 2010 's We The People , Stevens defiantly , unmistakably threw in his lot with Birthers , Tea Partiers , and everyone else convinced that Obama is transforming our nation into a socialist nightmare . In doing so , he ensured that he will forever be associated with ultra-conservative politics . <p> Listening to We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set , I experienced the opposite of joy and laughter . The mere sight of Stevens on the cover of We The People , peering out at me with cold , dead eyes while dressed like a Tea Party lunatic , sends me into an apoplectic rage . Stevens ' dispiriting oeuvre filled me with profound sadness and emptiness . When narrow-minded people dismiss country as the music of xenophobic , cornball , maudlin , flag-waving jackasses who luxuriate in their ignorance , they 're taking about Stevens , who embodies every negative country stereotype in unusually pure form . <p> The Stevens of We The People is a real-life version of Mr. Show 's C.S. Lewis Jr. , a cartoonish super-patriot railing semi-coherently about tax-and-spendocrats who want to soil God 's own U.S.A. with their rascally socialist schemes , baby-murdering , and nonsensical earth-protecting . That foolishness about global warming do n't hardly make no sense to Stevens . Since Stevens moonlights as one of our top climate-control scientists , I think we should all take his views on global warming very seriously . <p> We The People 's insufferable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous white man who proudly proclaims he gets his ideas from Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , and Bill O'Reilly , Stevens now feels qualified to speak for the sum of the American people , all of whom are apparently ready to revolt over our president 's mild health-care reforms . <p> The title track , written by veteran songwriter Max T. Barnes , crows \" You vote Obamacare \/ We 'll vote you out of there \/ We the people have awakened to your tricks \" before quipping that if politicians \" had the common sense that God gave a billy goat , \" they 'd realize that salt-of-the-earth Americans like himself are onto the kind of \" pork-barrel special-interest tax-and-spend scam \" that health care represents . In the tradition of protest singers from Woody Guthrie to Pete Seeger to Billy Bragg , Stevens augments his incisive political commentary with an enthusiastically blown raspberry , a foghorn to cover up profanity , and all manner of wacky sound effects , always the sign of a sophisticated musical manifesto . <p> In the video , Stevens -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- pretends a plunger is a guitar , wears founding-father garb , and stares vacantly while lip-syncing lyrics like \" We 've heard from Hannity , Beck , and Limbaugh what you got in mind for grandma \/ And we found this O'Reilly fella on Fox \/ We 're kind of like Joe The Plumber \/ And when we crunch the numbers , it all adds up to voting you out at the ballot box . \" <p> I love how Stevens sings of Bill O'Reilly as if the Fox fixture were some sort of homespun philosopher whom Stevens and his fellow intellectual seekers came upon spouting common-sense wisdom , whittling at the corner store , and smoking a corncob pipe , rather than an obnoxiously ubiquitous blowhard with a pulpit that stretches across our fine nation . The production values , performances , and sentiments expressed in the video are pure public access , yet the video has wracked up more than 3 million views on YouTube . Stevens has done well for himself underestimating the intelligence of the American people . <p> \" We The People \" sets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribou Barbie , \" shimmies defiantly under it . Stevens , once again looking simultaneously bored and dispirited , sings Sarah Palin 's praises in the most effusive manner imaginable , hailing her heretofore-unknown integrity and respect for the constitution , flying the flag for her 2012 political run , and attacking the liberal media for \" slicing and dicing \" her interviews . In Stevens ' mind , at least , there exists uncut footage of Palin 's interview with Katie Couric which reveals the former Alaskan governor to be an erudite , dignified stateswoman with a deep , comprehensive grasp of the subtleties and nuances of international politics . <p> But it is n't all wacky , ill-informed political discourse and zany sound effects . Stevens veers schizophrenically from asinine gags to shameless sentimentality , as evidenced by tracks like \" Thank You , \" where Stevens shakes his head in disgust over all those flag-burning protestor types who refuse to acknowledge the heroism of our fighting men and women . <p> But none of these crimes against music and comedy has generated the stir of Stevens ' anti-illegal-immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens ' songs , it 's incredibly lazy , yet also tries way too hard . Stevens seems to realize that his songs are devoid of funny lyrics , amusing ideas , insight , humanity , or any redeeming facet , so he piles on leaden shtick : silly , vaguely offensive accents ; zany fake public-service announcements ; and most noxiously of all , Stevens ' trademark idiot chuckle of self-satisfaction . A typical Stevens concoction is a misbegotten cross between a vaudeville sketch , morning-zoo wackiness , and a diatribe from your racist uncle . <p> We The People offers nothing but reactionary politics and pandering schmaltz delivered with supreme condescension . The songs on Stevens ' career-retrospective Box Set are largely apolitical , but Stevens ' love of crude ethnic stereotypes hints at the xenophobia that pervades We The People . In \" Osama Yo ' Mama , \" Stevens borrows the \" Middle Eastern \" setting on his Casio keyboard ( previously heard on his earlier hit \" Ahab The Arab \" ) to deliver a tongue-lashing to Osama bin Laden for embarrassing his mother with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that bin Laden 's mother speaks in a cartoonish backwoods drawl . The song is now laden with historical irony , since Stevens seemed convinced that bin Laden 's capture was imminent . Nine years , two wars , and tens of thousands of deaths later , we 're no closer to catching Bin Laden then we were on September 12 , 2001 . <p> Stevens has a reputation as the \" Weird Al \" Yankovic of country , but that association does a tragic disservice to Mr. Yankovic . If anything , \" Weird Al \" is the anti-Ray Stevens . \" Weird Al \" is a force for good in the universe , a talented , smart , funny , big-hearted icon whose music has brought joy and laughter to millions . To paraphrase a Simpsons line , \" Weird Al \" es bueno , Ray Stevens es el diablo . <p> My extreme dislike of Stevens is partially political and partly artistic . In spite of his bona fides as a respected musician and producer , the arrangements on Box Set are easy-listening bland and sterile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stevens does n't seem to understand the craft of comedy . His timing is awful , his delivery is smug and patronizing , and his kitchen-sink approach reeks of desperation . I did n't laugh once listening to the 73 Ray Stevens songs in my iPod . It proved the opposite of edifying:Listening to Stevens actively made me stupider . He is the first , and hopefully last , artist I 've covered in this column whose work is almost entirely devoid of merit . Thankfully , at this point I feel like I 've listened to enough country to confidently state that he 's the exception rather than the rule : an enormously successful veteran who has taken much from pop culture without giving anything back in return .

super-patriot railing semi-coherently about tax-and-spendocrats who want to soil god 's own u.s.a. with their rascally socialist schemes , baby-murdering , and nonsensical earth-protecting . that foolishness about global warming do n't hardly make no sense to stevens . since stevens moonlights as one of our top climate-control scientists , i think we should all take his views on global warming very seriously . <p> we the people 's insufferable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous white man who proudly proclaims he gets his ideas from sean hannity , rush limbaugh , glenn beck , and bill o'reilly , stevens now feels qualified to speak for the sum of the american people , all of whom are apparently ready to revolt over our president 's mild health-care reforms . <p> the title track , written by veteran songwriter max t. barnes , crows \" you vote obamacare \/ we 'll vote you out of there \/ we the people have awakened to your tricks \" before quipping that if politicians \" had the common sense that god gave a billy goat , \" they 'd realize that salt-of-the-earth americans like himself are onto the kind of \" pork-barrel special-interest tax-and-spend scam \" that health care represents . in the tradition of protest singers from woody guthrie to pete seeger to billy bragg , stevens augments his incisive political commentary with an enthusiastically blown raspberry , a foghorn to cover up profanity , and all manner of wacky sound effects , always the sign of a sophisticated musical manifesto . <p> in the video , stevens -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- pretends a plunger is a guitar , wears founding-father garb , and stares vacantly while lip-syncing lyrics like \" we 've heard from hannity , beck , and limbaugh what you got in mind for grandma \/ and we found this o'reilly fella on fox \/ we 're kind of like joe the plumber \/ and when we crunch the numbers , it all adds up to voting you out at the ballot box . \" <p> i love how stevens sings of bill o'reilly as if the fox fixture were some sort of homespun philosopher whom stevens and his fellow intellectual seekers came upon spouting common-sense wisdom , whittling at the corner store , and smoking a corncob pipe , rather than an obnoxiously ubiquitous blowhard with a pulpit that stretches across our fine nation . the production values , performances , and sentiments expressed in the video are pure public access , yet the video has wracked up more than 3 million views on youtube . stevens has done well for himself underestimating the intelligence of the american people . <p> \" we the people \" sets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caribou barbie , \" shimmies defiantly under it . stevens , once again looking simultaneously bored and dispirited , sings sarah palin 's praises in the most effusive manner imaginable , hailing her heretofore-unknown integrity and respect for the constitution , flying the flag for her 2012 political run , and attacking the liberal media for \" slicing and dicing \" her interviews . in stevens ' mind , at least , there exists uncut footage of palin 's interview with katie couric which reveals the former alaskan governor to be an erudite , dignified stateswoman with a deep , comprehensive grasp of the subtleties and nuances of international politics . <p> but it is n't all wacky , ill-informed political discourse and zany sound effects . stevens veers schizophrenically from asinine gags to shameless sentimentality , as evidenced by tracks like \" thank you , \" where stevens shakes his head in disgust over all those flag-burning protestor types who refuse to acknowledge the heroism of our fighting men and women . <p> but none of these crimes against music and comedy has generated the stir of stevens ' anti-illegal-immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stevens ' songs , it 's incredibly lazy , yet also tries way too hard . stevens seems to realize that his songs are devoid of funny lyrics , amusing ideas , insight , humanity , or any redeeming facet , so he piles on leaden shtick : silly , vaguely offensive accents ; zany fake public-service announcements ; and most noxiously of all , stevens ' trademark idiot chuckle of self-satisfaction . a typical stevens concoction is a misbegotten cross between a vaudeville sketch , morning-zoo wackiness , and a diatribe from your racist uncle . <p> we the people offers nothing but reactionary politics and pandering schmaltz delivered with supreme condescension . the songs on stevens ' career-retrospective box set are largely apolitical , but stevens ' love of crude ethnic stereotypes hints at the xenophobia that pervades we the people . in \" osama yo ' mama , \" stevens borrows the \" middle eastern \" setting on his casio keyboard ( previously heard on his earlier hit \" ahab the arab \" ) to deliver a tongue-lashing to osama bin laden for embarrassing his mother with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that bin laden 's mother speaks in a cartoonish backwoods drawl . the song is now laden with historical irony , since stevens seemed convinced that bin laden 's capture was imminent . nine years , two wars , and tens of thousands of deaths later , we 're no closer to catching bin laden then we were on september 12 , 2001 . <p> stevens has a reputation as the \" weird al \" yankovic of country , but that association does a tragic disservice to mr. yankovic . if anything , \" weird al \" is the anti-ray stevens . \" weird al \" is a force for good in the universe , a talented , smart , funny , big-hearted icon whose music has brought joy and laughter to millions . to paraphrase a simpsons line , \" weird al \" es bueno , ray stevens es el diablo . <p> my extreme dislike of stevens is partially political and partly artistic . in spite of his bona fides as a respected musician and producer , the arrangements on box set are easy-listening bland and sterile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . stevens does n't seem to understand the craft of comedy . his timing is awful , his delivery is smug and patronizing , and his kitchen-sink approach reeks of desperation . i did n't laugh once listening to the 73 ray stevens songs in my ipod . it proved the opposite of edifying:listening to stevens actively made me stupider . he is the first , and hopefully last , artist i 've covered in this column whose work is almost entirely devoid of merit . thankfully , at this point i feel like i 've listened to enough country to confidently state that he 's the exception rather than the rule : an enormously successful veteran who has taken much from pop culture without giving anything back in return .

        "title":"Lack of paid apps in Android Market contributes to app piracy ...\n",
        "text":"<p> Google recently announced a new licensing system to combat app piracy . Developers are pleased to see stronger protection of their creation , but if Google really wants to fight theft , it should expand paid app support to more countries . <p> Global Android users have been banging this drum , but the noise has fallen on deaf ears . After nearly two years of existence , the Android Market still supports paid apps in only 14 countries . Anyone not in one of those 14 nations is forced to sit on the sideline and wait for a day that is n't promised this calendar year or the next . <p> Or they can do the unthinkable and steal . <p> Make no mistake about it : hordes of people using illegal copies of Android apps would still do so if they could purchase apps . However , I 'd wager that there 's a large portion of consumers who would gladly pay for the privilege . The lack of support forces many to travel down the shady path . <p> Take a look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buka and Radiant . The retro shooter game Radiant has about 50,000 users , but thousands of those users run illegal copies of the app . <p> You 'll notice that places with the highest piracy rates are in regions where only a handful of nations have turned on the paid app switch . Hexage reports that <p> 70 percent of Radiant players in Europe , where only 8 of 49 nations have paid app support , use a pirated copy . <p> Asia , which has a whopping 97 percent , has only Japan and South Korea among its rank of paid users . <p> South America , which does n't have any nation eligible for paid apps , also has a 97 percentage rate of illegal copies . <p> North America ( Canada and the U.S. ) comparatively reports 43 percent illegal users . That 's considerably lower than other regions , and I strongly believe that the U.S. getting paid apps early contributed to that lower rating . Would Oceania 's 91 percent be lower had paid apps arrived in Australia and New Zealand sooner ? <p> Moralists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets for buying apps , but those solutions are less attractive and publicized than the built-in Market . The reality is that not every desirable app is in these markets , and constantly sideloading updates to apps is a headache for developers and consumers . <p> Adding paid support to more countries will not spell the end of app piracy . However , it could stem the tide of people turning to black markets out of frustration and necessity . Google continues to say that there are several external factors that prevent it from adding paid apps to more countries , but those obstacles need to be addressed . Licensing may set up roadblocks for now , but history has shown that dedicated people will eventually find their way around software limitation . It 's best to make the need to pirate apps a non-issue . <p> Hexage informed us that the anonymous usage data has been collected over a period of 10 months using Flurry Analytics and Google Checkout API . Piracy rate represents the ratio of unlicensed copies to the total number of installed copies . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users obtained the app illegally . <p> Yes this actical is correct . I live in Denmark one of the countries who do not have paidable apps . I do not want to root my mobil , to scare to brink it . I have found around this that is not illegal . I have bought prepaid at&amp;t simcard from the USA , with no money on it . I paid like 5 dollers for it on ebay and got it sent to my door , took 4 days . Then I switch out my danish simcard with the AT&amp;T card . Then my phone , even when im in Denmark , thinks it is american phone , all paid apps are available . Then i pay with my google check account and volia i have the apps i want . Then when I put my own simcard in agian , all my paid apps still get updated thru the market without changin simcard .. Some might see this as abit to much to go thru , but it is really not that bad , and I really want to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay apps . <p> The people in those affected countries use Market Enabler . I would like to think most people would do the right thing , rather than pirating paid apps . Market Enabler is easily found in a Google search if you are looking to unlock your Market to paid apps ... <p> Great post , Andrew . One of the most common objections I heard to my PaidAppPledge post was from folks who , because of the country they live in , are unable to buy paid apps in the Android Market . There was a time I 'd have argued that flaws in the official Market are just opportunities for 3rd party markets , none have really risen to the occasion , and at this point , Google just needs to start fixing things . The exciting hardware and huge numbers of people buying Android phones should drive huge interest from developers , but issues like these have the potential to really damp that interest . <p> Interesting idea . However , I reckon that someone who is savvy enough to pirate an app would pirate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathom how cheap some people are that they would actively pirate apps that cost $1-$2 a piece . That 's like shoplifting at the dollar store ! I swear , some people will steal anything that is n't bolted down ... <p> That 's the puch line : if one needs a $2 app , but has no easy way to pay the $2 -- she has a huge incentive to steal . When I can not use my cellular to pay for the parking place , I will usually park without paying , because I rarely have the coins that the machine will accept . Apple has the built-in payment channel always open , which makes it much easier to buy . <p> I was mainly referring to the rampant piracy in the US , where we do have access ( but I did n't say that ) . So , I agree to a certain extent -- I can see why people do it if there is no other avenue . Except there are 2 other perfectly legal options : US SIMS and other stores . You can sidestep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load apps over WiFi , as has already been mentioned ( but I suspect that many do n't know this ) . While I understand that it is a major PITA , and Google should get their a$$ in gear and get the MarketPlace running across the globe , I can not accept the argument that people are forced into pirating . Sure , there will be people that will pirate regardless , but there is a perfectly legal avenue to pursue , and it is n't that expensive . The MarketPlace should be available all over the world . However , Apple 's App Store is not entirely global , although it supports many more countries , and they keep adding new countries . It does illustrate that the problem with Google Checkout ( which is where the problem lies ) is more fundamental -- I suspect it has something to do with local laws , regulations and consumer rights . On a side note ... Seriously ? Even though you know there is a chance that you wo n't be able to park legally without coins if you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You always have the option to going around the corner and parking somewhere your phone can be used to make payments -- nobody forces you to park there illegally . Or you could *shock* keep the proper coins the car *shock* . Similarly , Google is n't forcing you to pirate . There are stores other than the Market Place which do n't have such stringent restrictions on location . See SlideMe , Handango , MobiHand , PocketGear\/AndroidGear , to name but a few . <p> &gt;&gt;On a side note ... Seriously ? Even though you know there is a chance that you wo n't be able to park legally without coins if you ca n't pay with your phone , you do it anyway ? You always have the option to going around the corner and parking somewhere your phone can be used to make payments -- nobody forces you to park there illegally . Or you could *shock* keep the proper coins the car *shock* . Similarly , Google is n't forcing you to pirate . There are stores other than the Market Place which do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MobiHand , PocketGear\/AndroidGear , to name but a few . &gt;&gt; Haha , I 'm guessing you do n't regularly park at meters . Keep coins in your car . You really expect me to believe that on the day you are running late , w\/o time to search for a parking space and no coins in your car , you just give up an go home rather than park w\/o paying . Whenever people make statements like this that ignore reality , it makes me suspicious of anything else they say . <p> You would be correct -- I do n't part at parking meters much at all . However , I will guarantee that I have enough coins in my car for parking at any time . I have a little compartment in the dash that has nothing but coins in it . See , I rarely use cash for anything ( and coins almost never get used ) , so those coins just sit there . I wo n't say that I would never park illegally -- it would depend on the circumstance . But generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying because , at least where I live , you are almost guaranteed to get a ticket within 30 minutes of parking there illegally . I do n't care if you believe me or not . You are free to dismiss anything I say with the belief that I am out of touch with reality , but that would be incredible short-sighted . Perhaps you should be a little more organized . Maybe you should leave a little earlier so you can park a couple of blocks further away where you can pay with your phone , or maybe , you know , make sure you have coins in the car ... it 's not that difficult . Or just deal with the parking tickets . You might benefit from this app : http : **44;66;TOOLONG ... <p> Like Microsoft does n't take initiative to provide Windows easily available in stores and at a affordable price , Android is also following the same path But things have improved with microsoft and their marketing strategies over the past 2-4 years .

        "text":"<p> The next iPad will probably include a three-axis gyroscope sensor for a more accurate device positioning , according to an electronics industry news site . Citing an analysis by UBM TechInsights , EE Times reported on Wednesday that Apple allegedly tested out InvenSense 's gyroscope with the 9.7-inch tablet , indicating plans to eventually add the sensor to a future iPad revision . <p> UBM TechInsights ' product manager Steve Bitton tore apart an iPad and spotted an empty slot conveniently placed next to the device 's accelerometer ( it 's occupied by a gyro sensor on iPhone 4 ) . This proves Apple toyed with the gyro idea on iPad , Bitton noted : <p> Apple was possibly testing the idea of a gyroscope within the iPad and had done so using the ITG-3200 by InvenSense as it was the first digital three-axis gyroscope to be released . Apple probably chose to wait until the next iteration of the iPad to introduce gyroscope capabilities . <p> The news that Apple is exploring its gyro options for iPad echoes a recent piece by MacRumors . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should also include a gyroscope sensor . <p> Apple opted for STMicroelectronics ' gyroscope in iPhone 4 , which is a slightly revised version of their off-the-shelf L3G4200D chip . It 's a MEMS gyroscope , basically an electronics version of its vibrational counterpart . The MEMS gyroscope features a plate called the \" proof mass \" that oscillates when a drive signal is applied to the set of drive capacitor plates , much like halteres of insects . <p> The level of miniaturization is mind-blowing , as revealed by iFixit and Chipworks who examined the ST LYPR540AH MEMS gyro ( not related to iPhone 4 ) under a scanning electron microscope . The stunning shots included below are the testament to the engineering marvel and impossibly accurate manufacturing required to build these tiny sensors . <p> The gyro in iPhone 4 senses pitch , roll , and yaw , while providing data on rotation about gravity .

        "text":"<h> Death of man in custody at Onondaga County jail highlights mysterious condition <p> Provided photoRaul Pinet Jr . died Aug. 6 at the Onondaga County Justice Center jail . His death , attributed to cocaine-induced excited delirium , has been ruled a homicide . <p> A brain disorder , cocaine and police restraint -- they were all at play when Raul Pinet Jr . died in custody three weeks ago , according to the Onondaga County medical examiner . <p> In a short news release last week , Dr. Robert Stoppacher cited those causes but made no mention of the manner of Pinet 's death -- accident , suicide , natural or homicide . <p> It was a homicide caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome , according to Pinet 's death certificate . Homicide is rarely used to classify such deaths , according to experts . <p> The weight that each of the three factors played in Pinet 's death after arriving at the Onondaga County Justice Center jail will be examined by four investigations and a possible lawsuit . <p> At the center of the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a condition that was first noted under another name in 1849 in mentally ill people , then resurfaced in the 1980s with the popularity of cocaine . <p> Neither Stoppacher nor District Attorney William Fitzpatrick would explain the rationale behind calling Pinet 's Aug. 6 death a homicide , nor the weight given to each of the three contributing factors . <p> View full sizeRaul Pinet Jr . ' s death certificate . His home address has been removed per the family 's request . <p> Even the country 's top experts ca n't agree on the basics of excited delirium : whether it should be classified as homicide or accidental , whether it 's a brain condition that 's genetic or caused by frequent drug abuse , or whether it even exists . <p> The forensic pathologist credited with first noting the syndrome in the mid-1980s , Dr. Charles Wetli , said such deaths should never be classified as homicides . They should be called accidental , as a drug overdose would be , because part of the syndrome is the brain 's response to the frequent use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner who 's in private practice in New Jersey . <p> The struggle with police is also part of the syndrome , Wetli said . In the few cases where victims died when not restrained , they died after jumping off a bridge , running into traffic or drowning in a lake , Wetli said . When police do get involved , they 're caught in a dilemma , he said . <p> \" If they do n't restrain him , the guy runs out in traffic and is killed , and the cop gets blamed for not restraining him , \" Wetli said . \" If the cop does restrain him and he dies , the cop gets blamed for killing him because he restrained him . For the poor cop , it 's a no-win situation . \" <p> Dr. Vincent DiMaio , a former San Antonio medical examiner who wrote a book on excited delirium , says such deaths should be classified as homicides because they almost always involve police restraint . <p> But the public often mistakenly holds police responsible because their intervention comes right before death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the normal physiological reactions of the body to stress and drugs , DiMaio wrote in the book he co-authored with his wife , Theresa . <p> \" Essentially , it 's an overdose of adrenaline , \" Vincent DiMaio said in an interview . <p> Deborah Mash , a neurology professor at the University of Miami who has studied excited delirium for 20 years , said such deaths are rarely called homicides . Of the 105 she 's studied at the school 's Excited Delirium Education , Research and Information Center , all were classified accidental , Mash said . <p> David Lassman \/ The Post-StandardThe death of Raul Pinet Jr . that occurred earlier this month at the Onondaga County Justice Center jail , 555 South State St. , Syracuse , has been ruled a homicide caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome . <p> Pinet 's death certificate says he died from sudden cardiac arrest caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome . It lists \" prone restraint \" as a significant condition contributing to death but not related to the cardiac arrest . <p> In a section asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip wrote , \" complications of use of illicit drug and confrontation with law enforcement . \" Philip is the pathologist in the medical examiner 's office who performed the autopsy . <p> The death certificate does not spell out how homicide was determined to be the manner of death . Homicide means another person caused someone 's death , but not always criminally . Pinet 's death will likely be a justifiable homicide , Sheriff Kevin Walsh said . <p> \" That 's what we 're looking at from our standpoint , \" Walsh said . His office has completed its investigation and sent its findings to the district attorney 's office . <p> \" It was justified because our use of force was within the law and was within the policy , \" he said . The deputies had to use force because Pinet was struggling so violently , Walsh said . Other agencies investigating are the district attorney 's office , Syracuse Police Department and the state Commission of Correction . <p> A Syracuse police spokesman could not be reached to disclose the status of that agency 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet Izzo , said she could n't comment on the medical examiner 's ruling because she has n't seen the autopsy report . Pinet 's widow , Tashara Pinet , plans on filing a claim against the county and the Syracuse Police Department to preserve her right to sue , Izzo said . <p> The sheriff 's office determined deputies acted properly , Walsh said . No deputies ever got on Pinet 's back to subdue him , Walsh said . They used three emergency restraint belts -- one around his shoulders and arms to avoid chest compression , one around his hips to avoid pushing his diaphragm into his lungs , and one to hold his legs , Walsh said . <p> \" Everything was done as safely as possible to control somebody who 's in a cocaine-induced excited delirium situation , \" Walsh said . <p> Pinet was released from state prison in June after serving half of an 18-month sentence on a drug conviction . He served a two-to-six year prison sentence ending in 2005 for another drug conviction . <p> After Syracuse police arrested Pinet on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with officers , police said . When he arrived at the jail , he continued to fight , police said . <p> Deputies got the restraint belts around him and placed him in a padded room , Walsh said . When they cut the belts and his clothes off of him , Pinet was still struggling , Walsh said . Walsh said he did not know whether Pinet was still conscious when deputies left the room . <p> Deputies observed Pinet for four to five minutes in the room before realizing something was wrong , Walsh has said . <p> Mash 's research shows that people with excited delirium have a faulty brain regulation of the heart . The brain chemistry goes chaotic and that leads to a fatal arrhythmia , because the brain controls the heart , she said . So it 's a neuro-cardiac event , she said . <p> The syndrome limits the brain 's ability to develop a tolerance for a drug such as cocaine , Wetli said . When that person goes on a binge , the brain gets overwhelmed with dopamine , and he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug 's effects the way most people can , he said . <p> Mash has seen some cases where someone died without police involvement , and others without drug involvement . But most have those contributing factors , she said . She believes the condition is genetic . <p> \" The way I look at this is you 're walking around with a loaded gun , \" said Mash , who has studied under a federal grant through the National Institute on Drug Abuse . \" That gun may never fire . But if you use drugs , or have these other contributing environmental issues , you 've cocked that gun , you 've put the bullet in the chamber . \" <p> Police often are wrongly held responsible , simply because they 're the ones applying the necessary restraint to the out-of-control subject , she said . <p> \" Look , nobody would even have been there if the person was n't in the state of excited delirium , \" Mash said . \" And , by the way , what are the police supposed to do ? \" <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excited delirium , to look for markers that would confirm that as the cause . Often medical examiners ask for her help , but she said she has not yet heard from Onondaga County officials . <p> Stoppacher found that Pinet 's cocaine use caused him to become disoriented , agitated and violent . It was apparently the first time someone 's death was attributed to excited delirium in Onondaga County , Walsh said . <p> The excited delirium label has drawn mixed acceptance among forensic pathologists .

        "lower_text":"<h> death of man in custody at onondaga county jail highlights mysterious condition <p> provided photoraul pinet jr . died aug. 6 at the onondaga county justice center jail . his death , attributed to cocaine-induced excited delirium , has been ruled a homicide . <p> a brain disorder , cocaine and police restraint -- they were all at play when raul pinet jr . died in custody three weeks ago , according to the onondaga county medical examiner . <p> in a short news release last week , dr. robert stoppacher cited those causes but made no mention of the manner of pinet 's death -- accident , suicide , natural or homicide . <p> it was a homicide caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome , according to pinet 's death certificate . homicide is rarely used to classify such deaths , according to experts . <p> the weight that each of the three factors played in pinet 's death after arriving at the onondaga county justice center jail will be examined by four investigations and a possible lawsuit . <p> at the center of the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a condition that was first noted under another name in 1849 in mentally ill people , then resurfaced in the 1980s with the popularity of cocaine . <p> neither stoppacher nor district attorney william fitzpatrick would explain the rationale behind calling pinet 's aug. 6 death a homicide , nor the weight given to each of the three contributing factors . <p> view full sizeraul pinet jr . ' s death certificate . his home address has been removed per the family 's request . <p> even the country 's top experts ca n't agree on the basics of excited delirium : whether it should be classified as homicide or accidental , whether it 's a brain condition that 's genetic or caused by frequent drug abuse , or whether it even exists . <p> the forensic pathologist credited with first noting the syndrome in the mid-1980s , dr. charles wetli , said such deaths should never be classified as homicides . they should be called accidental , as a drug overdose would be , because part of the syndrome is the brain 's response to the frequent use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner who 's in private practice in new jersey . <p> the struggle with police is also part of the syndrome , wetli said . in the few cases where victims died when not restrained , they died after jumping off a bridge , running into traffic or drowning in a lake , wetli said . when police do get involved , they 're caught in a dilemma , he said . <p> \" if they do n't restrain him , the guy runs out in traffic and is killed , and the cop gets blamed for not restraining him , \" wetli said . \" if the cop does restrain him and he dies , the cop gets blamed for killing him because he restrained him . for the poor cop , it 's a no-win situation . \" <p> dr. vincent dimaio , a former san antonio medical examiner who wrote a book on excited delirium , says such deaths should be classified as homicides because they almost always involve police restraint . <p> but the public often mistakenly holds police responsible because their intervention comes right before death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the normal physiological reactions of the body to stress and drugs , dimaio wrote in the book he co-authored with his wife , theresa . <p> \" essentially , it 's an overdose of adrenaline , \" vincent dimaio said in an interview . <p> deborah mash , a neurology professor at the university of miami who has studied excited delirium for 20 years , said such deaths are rarely called homicides . of the 105 she 's studied at the school 's excited delirium education , research and information center , all were classified accidental , mash said . <p> david lassman \/ the post-standardthe death of raul pinet jr . that occurred earlier this month at the onondaga county justice center jail , 555 south state st. , syracuse , has been ruled a homicide caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome . <p> pinet 's death certificate says he died from sudden cardiac arrest caused by cocaine-induced excited delirium syndrome . it lists \" prone restraint \" as a significant condition contributing to death but not related to the cardiac arrest . <p> in a section asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philip wrote , \" complications of use of illicit drug and confrontation with law enforcement . \" philip is the pathologist in the medical examiner 's office who performed the autopsy . <p> the death certificate does not spell out how homicide was determined to be the manner of death . homicide means another person caused someone 's death , but not always criminally . pinet 's death will likely be a justifiable homicide , sheriff kevin walsh said . <p> \" that 's what we 're looking at from our standpoint , \" walsh said . his office has completed its investigation and sent its findings to the district attorney 's office . <p> \" it was justified because our use of force was within the law and was within the policy , \" he said . the deputies had to use force because pinet was struggling so violently , walsh said . other agencies investigating are the district attorney 's office , syracuse police department and the state commission of correction . <p> a syracuse police spokesman could not be reached to disclose the status of that agency 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ janet izzo , said she could n't comment on the medical examiner 's ruling because she has n't seen the autopsy report . pinet 's widow , tashara pinet , plans on filing a claim against the county and the syracuse police department to preserve her right to sue , izzo said . <p> the sheriff 's office determined deputies acted properly , walsh said . no deputies ever got on pinet 's back to subdue him , walsh said . they used three emergency restraint belts -- one around his shoulders and arms to avoid chest compression , one around his hips to avoid pushing his diaphragm into his lungs , and one to hold his legs , walsh said . <p> \" everything was done as safely as possible to control somebody who 's in a cocaine-induced excited delirium situation , \" walsh said . <p> pinet was released from state prison in june after serving half of an 18-month sentence on a drug conviction . he served a two-to-six year prison sentence ending in 2005 for another drug conviction . <p> after syracuse police arrested pinet on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with officers , police said . when he arrived at the jail , he continued to fight , police said . <p> deputies got the restraint belts around him and placed him in a padded room , walsh said . when they cut the belts and his clothes off of him , pinet was still struggling , walsh said . walsh said he did not know whether pinet was still conscious when deputies left the room . <p> deputies observed pinet for four to five minutes in the room before realizing something was wrong , walsh has said . <p> mash 's research shows that people with excited delirium have a faulty brain regulation of the heart . the brain chemistry goes chaotic and that leads to a fatal arrhythmia , because the brain controls the heart , she said . so it 's a neuro-cardiac event , she said . <p> the syndrome limits the brain 's ability to develop a tolerance for a drug such as cocaine , wetli said . when that person goes on a binge , the brain gets overwhelmed with dopamine , and he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug 's effects the way most people can , he said . <p> mash has seen some cases where someone died without police involvement , and others without drug involvement . but most have those contributing factors , she said . she believes the condition is genetic . <p> \" the way i look at this is you 're walking around with a loaded gun , \" said mash , who has studied under a federal grant through the national institute on drug abuse . \" that gun may never fire . but if you use drugs , or have these other contributing environmental issues , you 've cocked that gun , you 've put the bullet in the chamber . \" <p> police often are wrongly held responsible , simply because they 're the ones applying the necessary restraint to the out-of-control subject , she said . <p> \" look , nobody would even have been there if the person was n't in the state of excited delirium , \" mash said . \" and , by the way , what are the police supposed to do ? \" <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excited delirium , to look for markers that would confirm that as the cause . often medical examiners ask for her help , but she said she has not yet heard from onondaga county officials . <p> stoppacher found that pinet 's cocaine use caused him to become disoriented , agitated and violent . it was apparently the first time someone 's death was attributed to excited delirium in onondaga county , walsh said . <p> the excited delirium label has drawn mixed acceptance among forensic pathologists . some say it 's used as a scapegoat for deaths caused by police . <p> dr. werner spitz , the former medical examiner in detroit , said these types of

        "text":"<h> A tale of two countries : Colombia and Venezuela <p> Colombia -- a nation perhaps best known to most Americans for drug exports -- has made remarkable progress in the last decade from improved security to economic growth . It stands in stark contrast to neighboring Venezuela . <p> On Aug. 7 , Juan Manuel Santos assumed the presidency of Colombia . It is a testimony to the strength of Colombian democracy that despite the immense popularity of outgoing president Alvaro Uribe , the Supreme Court ruled that Uribe could not run for a third term . <p> Juan Manuel Santos was sworn in as president of Colombia on Aug. 7 . <p> The terrorist , narco-trafficking FARC ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , once thought to be within range of taking the capital , are now on the defensive . <p> The nation 's economy weathered the 2009 financial crisis and is showing remarkable growth , aided by $10 billion annual foreign investment , rapidly growing exports , a boom in tourism , a bullish stock market , the lowest inflation in six decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , the country is still a work in progress . The FARC have n't been eliminated as a threat to security , gangs have emerged , and while the production of cocaine has been reduced by 60 percent since 2000 , it still feeds the international market and the violence and corruption we see in Mexico and Central America . <p> Unemployment is down to 11 percent from nearly 20 percent a decade ago , but poverty remains high , and the income distribution among the worst in the world . These sobering facts for Latin America 's longest-running democracy need to be addressed by Santos . <p> However , Colombia shines brightly compared with neighboring Venezuela . There the militarized populism of Hugo Chavez has created economic chaos and repression . <p> Flush with billions of petrodollars coming from the wallets of American drivers , Venezuela is a study in incompetence , inflation , crime and corruption . In the last two years , water , electricity and food have been rationed . <p> The Venezuelan murder rate is one of the highest in the world . Billions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , badly conceived projects and aid to bolster such political , social and economic disasters as Cuba and Nicaragua . Recently , some 130,000 tons of food rotted in government warehouses . More than one million Venezuelans have left the country . <p> Yet Chavez dreams of global ambitions , purchasing sophisticated military equipment from Russia and consorting with the likes of Iran . Venezuela is now a main transit for cocaine bound to the United States and Europe . <p> In July , Colombia brought strong evidence to the Organization of American States that Venezuela is harboring elements of the FARC . Playing the victim , Chavez responded by breaking diplomatic relations with Bogota and ordering troops to the border . <p> Though diplomatic relations have been re-established , the bluster is intended to distract from Venezuela 's failures and put the opposition on the defensive for next month 's parliamentary elections . <p> Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez . ( AP Photo\/Ariana Cubillos ) <p> Venezuela is a democracy in name only . There are no checks and balances on Chavez . He controls the Legislature and judiciary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assails the Church , and requires that Marxism be taught in private and public schools . The government manipulates the rules for political activity to prevent the opposition from winning office . <p> Moreover , thousands of Cuban operatives have infiltrated the intelligence and security apparatus . In this age of foolishness and wisdom , Chavez 's politics promise class conflict , corruption and war mongering . With all its troubles , Colombia has the better future and is a strong ally of the United States . <p> It would be a travesty if Congress does not pass the free trade agreement with Colombia that will benefit Americans and Colombians .

        "lower_text":"<h> a tale of two countries : colombia and venezuela <p> colombia -- a nation perhaps best known to most americans for drug exports -- has made remarkable progress in the last decade from improved security to economic growth . it stands in stark contrast to neighboring venezuela . <p> on aug. 7 , juan manuel santos assumed the presidency of colombia . it is a testimony to the strength of colombian democracy that despite the immense popularity of outgoing president alvaro uribe , the supreme court ruled that uribe could not run for a third term . <p> juan manuel santos was sworn in as president of colombia on aug. 7 . <p> the terrorist , narco-trafficking farc ( revolutionary armed forces of colombia ) , once thought to be within range of taking the capital , are now on the defensive . <p> the nation 's economy weathered the 2009 financial crisis and is showing remarkable growth , aided by $10 billion annual foreign investment , rapidly growing exports , a boom in tourism , a bullish stock market , the lowest inflation in six decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , the country is still a work in progress . the farc have n't been eliminated as a threat to security , gangs have emerged , and while the production of cocaine has been reduced by 60 percent since 2000 , it still feeds the international market and the violence and corruption we see in mexico and central america . <p> unemployment is down to 11 percent from nearly 20 percent a decade ago , but poverty remains high , and the income distribution among the worst in the world . these sobering facts for latin america 's longest-running democracy need to be addressed by santos . <p> however , colombia shines brightly compared with neighboring venezuela . there the militarized populism of hugo chavez has created economic chaos and repression . <p> flush with billions of petrodollars coming from the wallets of american drivers , venezuela is a study in incompetence , inflation , crime and corruption . in the last two years , water , electricity and food have been rationed . <p> the venezuelan murder rate is one of the highest in the world . billions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , badly conceived projects and aid to bolster such political , social and economic disasters as cuba and nicaragua . recently , some 130,000 tons of food rotted in government warehouses . more than one million venezuelans have left the country . <p> yet chavez dreams of global ambitions , purchasing sophisticated military equipment from russia and consorting with the likes of iran . venezuela is now a main transit for cocaine bound to the united states and europe . <p> in july , colombia brought strong evidence to the organization of american states that venezuela is harboring elements of the farc . playing the victim , chavez responded by breaking diplomatic relations with bogota and ordering troops to the border . <p> though diplomatic relations have been re-established , the bluster is intended to distract from venezuela 's failures and put the opposition on the defensive for next month 's parliamentary elections . <p> venezuela 's president hugo chavez . ( ap photo\/ariana cubillos ) <p> venezuela is a democracy in name only . there are no checks and balances on chavez . he controls the legislature and judiciary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assails the church , and requires that marxism be taught in private and public schools . the government manipulates the rules for political activity to prevent the opposition from winning office . <p> moreover , thousands of cuban operatives have infiltrated the intelligence and security apparatus . in this age of foolishness and wisdom , chavez 's politics promise class conflict , corruption and war mongering . with all its troubles , colombia has the better future and is a strong ally of the united states . <p> it would be a travesty if congress does not pass the free trade agreement with colombia that will benefit americans and colombians . compare that to how our petrodollars subsidize imperial schemes , corruption and repression in venezuela . <p> abelardo lechter is president of lefa international based in king of prussia , and chairman of the board of the pan american association of philadelphia . gabriel marcella taught strategy at the u.s. army war college and writes on latin american affairs .

Many here have survived for decades by subtle modes of deception , pilfering from their workplaces , selling their labor illegally or cheating their bosses in one form or another . <p> Now the government will ask them to comply with a new tax system and honestly report their earnings and expenses . <p> But no one knows how the tax system can succeed if the country does n't have a standardized income-reporting system , let alone the paper to print one on . <p> It 's also not clear how the government will cope with the enforcement burden of regulating the new private sector .

Last year , she won the title \" Miss Congeniality \" in the pageant . <p> She was one of 48 girls who competed in the three-day event this year .

Not that it would have been an issue for Tetreault . She has been a dancer for 12 years . <p> She is no newcomer to pageants . Her mom , Laurie , began entering her when she was a toddler , and Kay decided to resume the practice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but said Miss Massachusetts Teen USA was a whole new ballgame . <p> She worked especially hard on her communication skills . \" I knew they were n't just going to ask me what my favorite color was ! \" she said . <p> Kay has one older brother , in Arizona , who has always been a supporter . \" The whole entire family is really ecstatic about it , \" she said . <p> Among her prizes is a full scholarship to the Barbizon modeling school .

        "text":"<h> Channel Sponsor - Valuation <h> Analysis of ASC Data Suggests a Mature ASC Market <p> December 14 , 2010 <p> Those that have been involved with this industry in recent years have heard a common theory proclaiming the ASC market as a mature industry . What does this mean and is it true ? In this column we will illustrate and briefly highlight several trends that suggest this to be a valid assessment of the industry and explore the ways in which experienced ASC operators are responding . <p> Overall ASC growth has significantly leveled off <p> The number of ASCs operating in the United States expanded rapidly throughout the late 1990s through to the late 2000s ( see chart below ) . This high growth was fueled by a number of market dynamics , including : <p> physician desire to perform outpatient surgery in an focused and efficient environment ; <p> physician desire to participate in the management of their surgical facilities ; <p> physicians seeking to supplement their professional income streams ; <p> technological and surgical advances which made more procedures suitable for ASC setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market , providing funding , organization and expertise ; and <p> abundance of lenders willing to provide capital to physicians and developers . <p> Since 2008 , however , growth in the number of ASCs has significantly declined . Essentially , what is being observed in the ASC industry is an exhibition of the economic law of supply and demand . The significant expansion in the number of ASCs was driven by a demand ( from physicians and , to lesser extent , patients ) that had not yet been met by the supply ( of ASCs ) . This is no longer the case and in fact may be reversed , where supply now exceeds demand . <p> In addition to a decline in new ASC development , case volume levels at existing centers appear to support a maturing ASC industry . <p> Same-center case volume levels have significantly deteriorated <p> As indicated in the charts below , same center volume growth trends have turned negative . This trend is clearly evident in ASCs affiliated with the large , national ASC management companies ( see chart below ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by declining same center case volume projections . Although exacerbated by the economic downturn , this trend illustrates a more profound shift in the life cycle of the ASC industry as a whole . <p> ASC Company <p> FYE 2006 <p> FYE 2007 <p> FYE 2008 <p> FYE 2009 <p> Est 2010 <p> USPI <p> 7.0% <p> 6.0% <p> 2.0% <p> 2.0% <p> ( 1.0% ) <p> HCA <p> ( 1.2% ) <p> ( 1.1% ) <p> ( 0.2% ) <p> ( 0.1% ) <p> ( 1.3% ) <p> AMSURG <p> 5.0% <p> 4.0% <p> 4.0% <p> 1.0% <p> ( 1% ) - 0% <p> NOVAMED <p> 1.3% <p> 9.3% <p> ( 1.4% ) <p> ( 2.1% ) <p> ( 5.1% ) <p> Excess capacity is on the rise <p> Based on trended data compiled from VMG 's Intellimarker ASC Benchmarking Survey , average case volume levels per OR\/per day have declined materially since 2007 ( based on 2006 data ) . This 15.0 percent drop in operating room utilization supports the trend illustrated in the prior chart regarding same center volume levels and points to the likelihood of ASC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators are responding to mature market <p> When ASC operators can no longer rely upon an ever increasingly supply of new physician investment and volume , they turn their focus on increasing operating efficiencies . The chart below illustrates trends observed in the VMG ASC Intellimarker related to staff hours per case . From 2007-2010 ( based on 2009 data ) average staff hours per case dropped by approximately 25 percent . Considering staff costs generally comprise one-quarter to one-third of an ASC 's total operating expense , such a reduction is quite significant . <p> In addition to reducing costs by improving operating expense efficiency , many ASC operators are looking to control risk by reducing their center 's debt burden . The chart below , compiled from VMG 's ASC Intellimarker shows that the percentage of debt as compared to total assets has decline by nearly 30 percent . When faced with the challenges and uncertainty in today 's ASC market , owners and operators are much less inclined to saddle their centers with significant levels of debt . <p> In summary , our attempt with this piece was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general opinion of the state of the ASC industry -- an industry that has reached a mature state and faces significant present and future challenges .

It 's creepy ... like finding out you accidentally slept with your spouse 's twin .

That 's the part I never get -- I understand wanting to copy the business model and everything else , but when companies copy the Groupon voice , I just feel embarrassed for them . It 's like coming out with a comedy about high school geeks trying to get laid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porky 's and slapping your name on it . <p> What BuyWithMe DOES offer that differs ever so slightly from Groupon is a map showing the precise location of the business being featured .

Los Angeles doctors Nat Strand , 31 , and Kat Chang , 35 , spoke with PEOPLE about the highs and lows of their history-making run and why the experience means so much more than the money . ( Not that being able to pay off medical school debt is n't also putting a smile on their face . ) <p> Does it feel good to finally be able to talk about making history ? Nat : It was harder in the beginning but after a month it got easy . I almost forgot it had happened in real life . Kat : At first , you want to tell everyone . We 've had to keep the secret for about six months . But it was fun for our friends and family to go along for the ride and get nervous . <p> Did the chance to be the first all-female team to win motivate you ? Nat : We always play hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female winners . We just wanted to race in a classy , graceful fashion and do our best . The fact that we 're the first female-female team to win is an extra honor . Kat : We both love the show and we 'd still have wanted to do it even if a female team had won before . <p> What is it about your team that allowed you to finish first ? Kat : We 've worked together before in many situations where we have to try to get a specific task done often under stressful circumstances . That 's a very different dynamic than being related or dating . Nat : We 're pretty equal partners . We have a similar level of physical fitness , similar backgrounds and we think the same way . It made it easy to work together . There was definitely not a feeling of one person carrying the other in any way . I know what helps Kat and what does n't and likewise . We also handle fatigue and stress daily as doctors . <p> It seemed important to you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy active diabetic that was n't letting the disease set limitations in my life . I got emails throughout the show from mothers of newly diagnosed kids . One wrote me that her daughter had only been diabetic for four days and they watched the show together in the hospital . She said , \" Look at her . She does n't look any different than other racers . \" Those kinds of messages are important to get out there . <p> What was your favorite place or challenge ? Nat : When we were in Ghana in second-to-last place , trying to get that coffin to the warehouse , suddenly on that busy African highway all these kids gathered together to show us the way . We were running in a pack , laughing and smiling -- Kat : As we were carrying a giant lobster coffin . We are on the verge of being eliminated but it was so ridiculous and cool that we had to take a moment to laugh . <p> What was the hardest moment ? Kat : Eating the sheep 's head as a vegetarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest leg was Oman in large part because we used the map that was misleading and we went the wrong direction for about six hours . Fortunately , Gary and Mallory had the same map and were seven hours behind . Nat : If I ever have to drive a stick around the deserts of Oman again , it will be too soon . <p> That also speaks to how even a good team needs luck to win.Nat:The Race is like life . Some people get good luck and some bad and in the end , it is usually a fair shake . A lot of it is how you get yourself out of a bad situation . You have to avoid huge mistakes and recovering from bad luck like a flat tire . Kat : And sometimes you have to count on others having bad luck . <p> Do patients recognize you ? Kat : In the last couple of weeks , pretty much everyday one or two patients recognize me . It 's uncomfortable because we 're private people , but it has been made easier by how nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to appointments with cameras and things for me to sign and bring their kids . ",

        "text":"<h> Meeting Again for the First Time <p> It 's Friday afternoon , and that means clinic . It 's 1 p.m. , and that means I 'm walking to get Samantha from the waiting room for our therapy session . I take a deep breath before I open the door , and find myself looking forward to our session . <p> \" Hello , Samantha , \" I say , \" I 'm Dr. Hufford . Come on back . \" <p> I always reserve the same room for our work , hoping that it will help her to remember that we 've met before . Samantha and I have met many times before , but for her , every session is like meeting again for the first time . She is stuck in an unrelenting present , experiencing life about an hour at a time , before her anterograde amnesia -- an inability to remember new events -- sweeps the memories away , floating just out of her reach . <p> \" Cognitive difficulties \" is the way that her medical record describes it . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from before about 15 years ago . She remembers going to college , having friends and ambitions , and falling in love . But her description of the accident is distant and clinical ; a factual recitation of what she has been told happened . In a casual conversation you might not realize that you were talking to someone who would , only hours later , have no recollection of ever meeting you . <p> In clinical terms , her short-term memory is unable to be consolidated into long-term memory . To Samantha , she can sense that her memories are just out of reach , as though if she only tried hard enough they would come flooding back to her . <p> But the flood never comes . <p> Samantha 's clever , self-deprecating sense of humor was endearing right away . She reminded me of what one of my clinical supervisors used to say -- being able to laugh at yourself is the best single indicator of mental health . But her self-deprecating joke from our first session was repeated in our second session , and then again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth session , I felt nauseous as she started it again . The joke is a mirthless reminder of what Samantha has lost , and what she continues to lose : With each passing hour , the amnesia continually washes over her , pulling her memories out to sea in an undertow of neurotransmitters run amok . <p> After each of my psychotherapy sessions , I dutifully make an entry into my patient 's medical record , choosing prepackaged dropdown phrases . ' The patient Choose one : Denied , Acknowledged auditory hallucinations , ' ' Mood was Choose one : Euthymic , Elevated , Labile , Constricted , Flat , ' Suicidal ideation was : Choose one : Not present , Present but with no plan , Present with plan ' . Click , click , click , and I try not to think about the fact that my session notes for Samantha are all the same , the exact same . <p> Our hours together are spent oscillating between creating simple printed reminders for her to post in her room reminding her not to dwell on specific worries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can please help . There is no place in the session note for her questions -- questions not about the meaning of life , but the meaning of her life , about feeling lonely and wondering who would ever want to be with her . She thinks that she is broken , and wonders what kind of life she can ever have , unanchored from the past . She remarks how well I seem to understand her struggles , unaware that my prescient empathy is an accidental byproduct of her amnesia . <p> Psychotherapy is not my day job . Except for a few hours every Friday afternoon , my working life is spent in drug development , designing and running clinical trials of new medicines for psychiatric problems . That time speeds by , punctuated by meetings , teleconferences , reviews of scientific papers , and summaries of how a new drug compares to placebo in clinical trials of hundreds of patients . It is clean and tidy work . In contrast , the time that I volunteer on Friday afternoons is a chance to wade into the messiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violence , and ugliness that is a world away from my office in La Jolla . <p> As the Fridays pass by , one day I hear that the famous neurology patient , H.M. , has died . H.M. 's amnesia was remarkable , and decades of research into his deficits illuminated , among other things , that declarative memory ( knowledge of facts and events ) was separate from procedural memory ( how to do things ) . In short , it is possible to learn something , and yet be unaware that you know it . Upon his death , his brain was sent to San Diego 's Brain Observatory for dissection and digital imaging . One morning , I log on to a website that is streaming live video of the transection of his brain . The automated surgical scraper takes another pass at his frozen brain as the lab technicians update the accompanying blog noting , \" The ventricles can now be seen ! \" It 's neuroscience as performance art . <p> I close my browser before the next scrape across his brain and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of palm trees . I wonder whether I could live Samantha 's life , dutifully waiting for a medical advance that has yet to come , while not even knowing how long I 've been waiting . I am sure that I could not , drunk as I am on the good fortune of my life . I think of the expectant look on her face in the waiting room every Friday , as she sits there with grace and patience , surrounded by people impatiently waiting for their 10 minutes with a physician and a prescription for what ails them . <p> I have no pills for Samantha , and know that for such complex patients a single clinical trial is unlikely to ever be run -- Samantha 's problems are too complex , and the rarity of patients with such disorders is insufficient for the business of medicine to ever work in her favor . I feel like an agnostic little drummer boy , dutifully drumming my drum while chastising myself for not having more to offer . <p> Am I helping Samantha ? I think that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling is quickly swept away , floating just out of my reach . And then , busy with my work and happy life , another week is gone . It 's Friday afternoon again , and that means clinic . It 's 1 p.m. , and that means I 'm walking to get Samantha from the waiting room for our therapy session . I take a deep breath before I open the door , and find myself looking forward to our session . \" Hello Samantha , \" I say . \" I 'm Dr. Hufford . Come on back . \" <p> Last reviewed : By John M.

Their Spotify-based program plays you the songs on the music streaming site that have never been listened to ... ever . That 's it . \" There was an article floating around early last December that mentioned the crazy stat that four million songs had n't even been listened to . Co-founder Lane Jordan found it and sent it my way with the seeds of the idea , \" fellow co-founder Nate Gagnon told me . <p> Jordan discovered that 20 percent of Spotify 's library had never been heard -- not even once .

Forgotify scans Spotify 's API for songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the library to be heard . The rest is up to curious listeners . <p> The first song I heard when I loaded up Forgotify was \" Trouble in Paradise \" by Romanovsky &amp; Phillips .

Gagnon told me he 's working on a project to \" launch a big anti-violence project in Chicago over the next few months . \" He also noted that he did n't get invested in the project because of being part of an unknown music group , like those he helps expose .

Each night they drew closer . Then they married and had many children . <p> Some of their children were good , and others were very bad . Man sent the bad children to the West .

The striking rock formation in a publicly closed section of Pyramid Lake still shows \" Stone Mother \" looking to the West with an empty baby basket at her feet . <p> So that is how history began , at least in the creation story of the Northern Paiute at Pyramid Lake , Nevada 's largest native tribe . Other tribes have different creation stories , but Pyramid Lake remains a holy place to American Indian people everywhere .

A militia of 105 volunteers was organized . The militia pursued the Numa north up the Truckee River to near present-day Nixon . <p> A massacre followed -- a massacre of whites . <p> Within three days , the Numa killed 76 militia members .

( Screen grab from CNN.com ) <h> Earlier Plain Dealer stories : <p> The chapter 's website has now replaced its story about Blazek winning the award with a statement saying : \" The IABC Cleveland Chapter board of directors and Kelly Blazek have mutually agreed that she will return the chapter 's 2013 Communicator of the Year award .

But when Mekota and others went public with Blazek 's emails denying their requests to connect , Cleveland 's close-knit marketing communications committee expressed outrage and concern that Blazek 's email would reflect badly on Cleveland and discourage Millennials from moving here . <p> IABC Cleveland named Blazek its Communicator of the Year for her hobby of compiling job openings in the marketing , public relations , digital communications , media , journalism , graphics , and nonprofit management positions throughout Northeast Ohio .

        "text":"<p> To understand why , we have to start in 2008 . The decision of whether or not to allow Internet providers to favor some forms of traffic over others -- also known as net neutrality -- was beginning to bubble up in Washington . Some providers started blocking forms of web traffic -- it 's the best they can do to deal with the insane demand for transfers they get in those peak hours of 7 p.m. to 11 p.m . <p> \" The rationale was that ( all the traffic ) was degrading the combined experience of all their users and therefore this was justified , \" Klinker says , \" and that struck at the core of an open Internet . \" <p> Eric Klinker <p> BitTorrent was a rock between several hard places : the Internet providers , the lawmakers , and the users hungry for download speeds . But they did n't have the conventional resources for getting things done in Washington . They only had 23 employees . They had no government affairs office , no avenue for lobbying legislation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , who were asking themselves a few important questions : <p> What if there was a way to solve the traffic jam without legislation ? <p> And what if the solution were a technological one ? <p> That solution was the Micro Transport Protocol -- a new way of organizing the Internet traffic . <p> Micro Transport Protocol , or uTP for short , is a way of allowing traffic to re-arrange itself so things do n't get so jam-packed . It 's like when you hack your commute by working for a few hours from home before taking to the bumper-to-bumper freeway or cheek-to-jowl subway : you wait to make your move until the coaster is clearer . Rather than having BitTorrent shoulder more of its way into bandwidth during peak hours , uTP re-arranges to a later time . <p> This stands in contrast to TCP\/IP , an older , less agile protocol . When you 're on TCP\/IP , the network hums along until a data starts failing to reach its destination . Only then does it signal that the Internet connection is congested . <p> \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to slow down until you 've hit your first pedestrian , \" Klinker says . \" At the end of the day , TCP is n't a particularly intelligent method ; it 's designed to see damage on the traffic and then get out of the way . uTP is designed to sense that damage is about to happen and then get out of the way . \" <p> Let 's say you get home from work and want to watch House of Cards on Netflix or call your cousin on Skype . Under uTP , any BitTorrent transfers you have going on in the background will politely wait for your streaming to be finished before they jump in . Then , in the uncrowded hours of the late night , uTP lets your torrenting get going , soaking up all that suddenly spare bandwidth . Now that uTP is used for 80% of BitTorrent transfers , traffic no longer peaks in that 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. time slot . This is also why the monthly userbase has grown from 60 million in 2008 to 170 million today -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . <p> To Klinker , The uTP is a win-win-win . It 's allowed BitTorrent to get even bigger while lessening its presence at peak hours . It 's a win for Internet providers because they get more value from the existing investment of their network . It 's a win for users because they do n't want their downloads and uploads crowding into crowded hours . <p> Together , uTP feels like a lesson for the ongoing net neutrality debate . <p> \" It 's the best example we have of technology being used to solve what is perceived to be a policy problem , \" Klinker says . \" Especially in the light of the Internet as a global phenomenon , there 's no single regulatory body for the Internet and hopefully there wo n't be .

        "title":"By hiring a climate disinformer, Nate Silver undermines his entire ...\n",
        "text":"<p> Nate Silver claims that his new blog is a data journalism organization . Silver is a numbers guy , and because his analyses of political polls proved more accurate than those made by the often inept traditional media competition , he has become celebrated as a genius , if not quite a shaman . How ironic , then , that with over 97 percent of the 11,944 peer-reviewed studies of \" global climate change \" or \" global warming \" between 1991-2011 endorsing the consensus on anthropogenic global warming , with almost every scientific society or association long before having concurred on the consensus , and with the U.S. National Academies of Science and the British Royal Society now saying that the consensus is more certain than ever , Silver would hire as one of his science writers the egregious purveyor of disinformation on climate change , Roger Pielke , Jr . And the worst part about it , given Silver 's reputation as a statistics guy , is that Pielke often is criticized for butchering statistics and data analysis . <p> \" Given Nate 's professed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him hire for his new venture an individual who has displayed a pattern of sloppiness when it comes to the analysis of climate data , \" said top climate scientist Michael Mann via email . Pointing to a chapter in Silver 's recent book that addresses climate change ( for which Mann was interviewed ) he adds , \" Sadly , this is n't the first time Nate has been led astray when it comes to dealing with the science of climate change . \" <p> After having been interviewed by Silver for that book , and despite obviously liking Silver , personally , when Mann read the result , he wrote an excoriating critique that should be read in its entirety . <p> Much more below the fold . <p> Among the many lowlights : <p> As a result , Nate 's chapter on climate change ( Chapter 12 : \" A Climate of Healthy Skepticism \" ) is marred by straw man claims that do n't stand up to scrutiny . These include the assertion that ( a ) climate scientist James Hansen 's famous 1988 predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) \" the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) settles on just one forecast that is endorsed by the entire group \" ( pure nonsense -- even the most casual reading of the IPCC reports reveals that great care taken to emphasize the non-trivial spreadamong model predictions , and to denote regions where there is substantial disagreement between the projections from different models ) and that ( c ) \" relatively little is understood \" about the El Nino cycle ( here I imagine that Nate might have misinterpreted our own discussion about the matter ; I explained in our discussion that there are still open questions about how climate change will influence the El Nino phenomenon -- but that hardly means that we know \" relatively little \" about the phenomenon itself ! In fact , we know quite a bit about it ) . Finally , and perhaps most troubling ( d ) while Nate 's chapter title explicitly acknowledges the importance of distinguishing \" signal \" from \" noise \" , and Nate does gives this topic some lip service , he repeatedly falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the noise ) can tell us something about predictions of global warming trends ( the signal ) . They ca n't -- they really ca n't . <p> Nate 's view of uncertainty , and its implications for climate model predictions , is particularly misguided . He asserts that the projections of the IPCC forecasts have been \" too aggressive \" , but that is simply wrong . It neglects that in many cases , e.g. as regards the alarming rate of Arctic sea ice decline ( we saw a new record low set just weeks ago ) , the climate models have been far too cautious ; We are decades ahead of schedule relative to what the models predicted . Uncertainty cuts both ways , and in many respects -- be it the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice , or the melting of the ice sheets -- it is cutting against us . Uncertainty , as many economists recognize , is thus a reason for action , not inaction ! I 'm surprised someone as sharp as Nate just does n't appear to get that . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gore , and deriding his cherry-picking and misrepresenting Mann 's own interview statements for the purpose of promoting a false narrative : <p> Most disappointing to me of all was the false equivalence that Nate draws between the scientific community 's efforts to fight back against intentional distortions and attacks by an industry-funded attack machine , and the efforts of that attack machine itself .

        "lower_text":"<p> nate silver claims that his new blog is a data journalism organization . silver is a numbers guy , and because his analyses of political polls proved more accurate than those made by the often inept traditional media competition , he has become celebrated as a genius , if not quite a shaman . how ironic , then , that with over 97 percent of the 11,944 peer-reviewed studies of \" global climate change \" or \" global warming \" between 1991-2011 endorsing the consensus on anthropogenic global warming , with almost every scientific society or association long before having concurred on the consensus , and with the u.s. national academies of science and the british royal society now saying that the consensus is more certain than ever , silver would hire as one of his science writers the egregious purveyor of disinformation on climate change , roger pielke , jr . and the worst part about it , given silver 's reputation as a statistics guy , is that pielke often is criticized for butchering statistics and data analysis . <p> \" given nate 's professed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him hire for his new venture an individual who has displayed a pattern of sloppiness when it comes to the analysis of climate data , \" said top climate scientist michael mann via email . pointing to a chapter in silver 's recent book that addresses climate change ( for which mann was interviewed ) he adds , \" sadly , this is n't the first time nate has been led astray when it comes to dealing with the science of climate change . \" <p> after having been interviewed by silver for that book , and despite obviously liking silver , personally , when mann read the result , he wrote an excoriating critique that should be read in its entirety . <p> much more below the fold . <p> among the many lowlights : <p> as a result , nate 's chapter on climate change ( chapter 12 : \" a climate of healthy skepticism \" ) is marred by straw man claims that do n't stand up to scrutiny . these include the assertion that ( a ) climate scientist james hansen 's famous 1988 predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( b ) \" the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) settles on just one forecast that is endorsed by the entire group \" ( pure nonsense -- even the most casual reading of the ipcc reports reveals that great care taken to emphasize the non-trivial spreadamong model predictions , and to denote regions where there is substantial disagreement between the projections from different models ) and that ( c ) \" relatively little is understood \" about the el nino cycle ( here i imagine that nate might have misinterpreted our own discussion about the matter ; i explained in our discussion that there are still open questions about how climate change will influence the el nino phenomenon -- but that hardly means that we know \" relatively little \" about the phenomenon itself ! in fact , we know quite a bit about it ) . finally , and perhaps most troubling ( d ) while nate 's chapter title explicitly acknowledges the importance of distinguishing \" signal \" from \" noise \" , and nate does gives this topic some lip service , he repeatedly falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the noise ) can tell us something about predictions of global warming trends ( the signal ) . they ca n't -- they really ca n't . <p> nate 's view of uncertainty , and its implications for climate model predictions , is particularly misguided . he asserts that the projections of the ipcc forecasts have been \" too aggressive \" , but that is simply wrong . it neglects that in many cases , e.g. as regards the alarming rate of arctic sea ice decline ( we saw a new record low set just weeks ago ) , the climate models have been far too cautious ; we are decades ahead of schedule relative to what the models predicted . uncertainty cuts both ways , and in many respects -- be it the rapid decline in arctic sea ice , or the melting of the ice sheets -- it is cutting against us . uncertainty , as many economists recognize , is thus a reason for action , not inaction ! i 'm surprised someone as sharp as nate just does n't appear to get that . <p> and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gore , and deriding his cherry-picking and misrepresenting mann 's own interview statements for the purpose of promoting a false narrative : <p> most disappointing to me of all was the false equivalence that nate draws between the scientific community 's efforts to fight back against intentional distortions and attacks by an industry-funded attack machine , and the efforts of that attack machine itself . he characterizes this simply as a battle between \" consensus \" scientists and \" skeptical \" individuals , as if we 're talking about two worthy adversaries in a battle . this framing is flawed on multiple levels , not the least of which is that those he calls \" skeptics \" are in fact typically no such thing . there is a difference between honest skepticism -- something

Good choice . <p> Sunday in the championship round of the NCAA Fencing Championships at Ohio State 's St. John Arena , Kaito Streets was lifted up by his Penn State teammates onto their shoulders after Streets defeated Ferenc Valkai of St. John 's . Streets ' victory was the final step in Penn State 's 13th national championship in fencing . <p> Kaito 's dad was in the arena starting chants of \" We are Penn State \" while also texting Tomoko back in California to share the happy news . <p> Streets won a Junior Olympic championship in 2011 , but this was his crowning achievement . And it started with his mom years ago because she happened to see him playing with swords and knives during a kids ' activity in Japan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it , they wanted me to try something new , compared to baseball and basketball , \" Kaito Streets said . \" I did all kinds of sports . So did my brother . They wanted me to do something different than my brother . Fencing stuck with me . \" <p> Over two days , Streets won 22 matches in saber , tying foil champion Gerek Meinhardt of Notre Dame for the most victories in the men 's tournament . Those victories helped Penn State win its first national championship since 2010 . And the team title mattered more to Streets than his individual championship . He could n't bear to see the Nittany Lions step into their bus ride home without the national championship trophy . <p> \" We came in here wanting to win as a team , especially for all the seniors who had n't won yet . It would have been the second class to not win a championship , \" Streets said . \" So I did n't want that to happen . Especially like my mentor , Adrian Bak , a senior who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win a championship . I wanted to do it for him . <p> \" It meant a lot that we won as a team . The individual was just a plus . \" <p> The victory also meant something to interim coach Wes Glon . He is hoping to become head coach . <p> \" A lot of recruits are coming because they expect to be on a winning team , \" Glon said . \" This will help us with recruits and everything . \" <p> Streets dominated the saber field in the men 's tournament after arriving in Columbus with his confidence shaken . His sixth-place regional finish was a little bit better than his eighth-place finish as a freshman in 2013 . Preparations leading up to the NCAA championships were stressful . <p> \" I struggled at regionals , \" Streets said . \" I thought going to regionals , I had a good game plan but it did n't work out . Adrian Bak just beat me down . They yelled at me . Training was tough . <p> In the midst of those struggles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to the gym and Streets is there . <p> \" Five o'clock in the morning or Saturday evening , he will always be there , \" Glon said . <p> Bak , who finished second at the regional , was expected to be the title contender for Penn State in saber . Instead , Streets blew through the field . He won 14 of 15 matches the first day , three more wins than Bak and one more than Shaul Gordon , who was runner-up at the 2013 NCAA championships with Penn State before transferring to Penn . <p> \" I stayed humble . I did n't want to get overconfident , \" Streets said . <p> \" Coming in , I was very nervous . After the first day , my confidence went up . Talking to my dad , he told me , ' Do n't get big-headed . Stay humble . Just focus on every touch . It 's not over yet . Every touch , every bout counts . Just go for it .

        "text":"<h> Suddenly the cops and firemen and other municipal workers ' retirement does n't look so bleak in the Motor City . But do n't try this at home . <h> More <p> To the great relief of firefighters , police and other public employees in bankrupt Detroit , city fathers recently plugged a huge hole in their pension plans . For now , anyway , something close to these employees ' retirement dreams have been restored . <p> But how did they do it ? Just a few weeks ago , Detroit leaders pegged the pension shortfall at $3.5 billion -- about 20% of the city 's total indebtedness -- and they were threatening to slash benefits beyond already expected cuts of up to 14% for cops and firemen and 34% for other workers . Miraculously , workers are now being assured that benefits cuts will be comparatively tame , amounting to less than a 5% reduction for those hardest hit . <p> Where did the money come from ? Who found the pot of gold that is enabling the city to fill such a big funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one found so much as a single hard penny . Actuaries simply juggled a few numbers on the city ledger and , voila , a paper windfall appeared . Do n't try this at home . <p> The most important accounting change was the assumed rate of return on investments held in the city 's two big retirement funds . Previously , the annual rate of return was estimated at 6.25% and 6.5% on the two funds . Now the city is assuming a rate of return of 6.75% on both funds . Why the bump ? In part , anyway , the city seems to be taking heart in the stock market 's big gain last year , when after lackluster returns the past decade or so the S&amp;P 500 rebounded with a glowing 32% total return . <p> A sustained higher rate of return would mean more annual income for the funds , making them better able to meet benefits promises with the same amount of assets . But the question remains : Is the higher return assumption realistic ? One year is not a trend . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns ahead . A bankruptcy judge still must rule on the rosier projections . <p> A pension fund manager boosting the return assumption because stocks finally had a good year is a little like you at home predicting next winter wo n't be so cold and slashing your heating budget . You might be right . But it 's just a guess -- and if the guess is wrong you will have to find the money elsewhere to heat the house . Your finances only looked better briefly ; the picture dimmed as soon as another cold winter hit . <p> So how realistic is the 6.75% return assumption ? In the Detroit General Retirement System , annualized returns over the past seven years have been 3.9% , according to one analysis . The past five years , public pension funds have had a median annualized return of 5.3% , according to another analysis . Not so good , right ? <p> But let 's not throw Detroit 's leaders under the bus just yet . Because people generally work and accrue benefits over 40 years or so , pension funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund return over the past 25 years has been 8.6% . The typical pension fund manager today assumes long-term rates of return between 7% and 8% . So Detroit has company , and may even seem cautious . <p> Among others , Warren Buffett has scolded pension managers for not recognizing a fundamental shift to slower growth and lower returns . But the new assumptions in the Motor City are n't completely unsupportable . Maybe the city 's employees will catch a much-needed break and get the higher returns that pension managers hope for . ",

        "title":"Love Cover Songs? Thank This Terrible Supreme Court Decision ...\n",
        "text":"<h> Scales of Justice <h> How a terrible Supreme Court decision about player pianos made the cover song what it is today . <p> The player piano deeply troubled composers at the time of its introduction . <p> Courtesy of Rama\/Mus ? e Baud <p> Way before Spotify , stereos , or even radio , Americans who wanted to listen to music at home had one choice : They could play it themselves . This changed by the 1890s , when a hot new technology arrived : the player piano . Player pianos were miraculous in their ability to play popular songs and old standards alike while people sang along , danced , or just enjoyed the sounds . But as with a lot of newfangled machines , not everyone loved the player piano . <p> In particular , the technology deeply troubled composers , such as the famed John Philip Sousa . Sousa worried that the pianos would kill the public 's demand for sheet music , and copyright royalties from the sale of sheet music were what paid composers ' bills . To make matters worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs they put on piano rolls -- scrolls of paper with holes punched out in patterns . People could n't read the rolls ; they spoke only to machines . And on that ground , the player piano companies argued that the rolls did not \" copy \" songs , and so could be manufactured and distributed without the need to pay royalties . <p> This was an exceptionally stupid argument . Sheet music and player piano rolls both copy songs ; they just use different languages . What matters is what comes out when the language is translated . And for both , the answer is the same : music . <p> Advertisement <p> So the issue was n't terribly difficult , but apparently it was complicated enough to fool the Supreme Court . In a 1908 case called White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co. , the Supreme Court sided with the player piano companies . The court said that because humans could n't read player piano rolls , they were not in fact copies , and as a result , composers like Sousa could n't demand any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will innovate if others can copy freely . Why invest the time to invent a better mousetrap , or write a great song , if someone can just take the fruit of your hard work and sell it themselves ? This basic logic -- that copying is bad for creativity -- is the fundamental reason we have patent and copyright law . These rules exist to make sure that copying is only legal when the creator agrees to it . Unauthorized copying -- as anyone who has watched a DVD with an FBI warning at the start knows -- is against the law . <p> So when , more than a century ago , the Supreme Court declared that copying by player piano companies was just fine , we saw the beginning of a process that culminated in the death of American songwriting . Songwriters stopped writing , fearful that the piano roll companies would just steal their new songs and feed the expanding market for player pianos at home . Thanks to the Supreme Court , the golden age of American song essentially ended in 1908 . <p> In creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea it would let loose one of the great innovative forces in music . <p> If something seems wrong about this story , it 's because the last part is completely false . As we all know , the golden age of American songwriting did not end in 1908 . In fact , geniuses such as George Gershwin and Cole Porter were still kids when White-Smith Publishing was decided . Nearly all the \" great American standards \" were written in the decades after White-Smith Publishing . The reason American songwriting not only survived the onslaught of the player piano , but thrived , tells us a lot about how creativity really works . <p> The first important thing to know is that the actual result in White-Smith Publishing lasted but a year before it was overturned by Congress . The Copyright Act of 1909 extended the law to cover all \" mechanical \" reproductions of songs , whether read by people or machines . At the same time , however , Congress did a very important thing : It mandated that all songs would be subject to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any musician could copy another 's song without asking permission , so long as they paid a low standardized fee to the songwriter ( $0.02 per copy , originally , and quite a bit lower , adjusted for inflation , today ) . So on the one hand , Congress overthrew the argument that player piano rolls were not songs . But on the other , Congress set everyone free to copy , just so long as a small fee was paid . <p> So why did Congress create this unusual system of legal copying ? Because it was afraid of one company -- Aeolian . That firm is long gone . But in the early part of the 20th century , Congress viewed Aeolian as something like the Microsoft or Google of the nascent player piano market . <p> Anticipating that Congress would overturn White-Smith Publishing , Aeolian swiftly bought up song rights from musicians and publishing companies so it could copy them onto player piano rolls . Aeolian 's weaker competitors complained to Congress about this attempt to corner the music market . <p> An automatic piano roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So to keep the Aeolian Co. from having a monopoly on the then-crucial player piano roll market , Congress allowed anyone to make a mechanical reproduction of someone else 's song . And that does n't just mean that Aeolian 's competitors could make their own piano rolls of popular tunes . Congress 's compulsory licensing scheme legalized the cover song -- anyone can make their own recording of someone else 's song , just so long as a recording of that song has previously been released , and the cover artist pays the required fee . ( In practice , most cover artists pay privately negotiated rates that are even lower than the fee set by Congress ) . And the freedom to cover others ' songs gave birth to a vibrant culture of continuous musical revival , remaking and reinterpretation , all of which allows good songs to become great and , sometimes , we must admit , classics to be butchered . <p> It 's all in the eye ( or ear ) of the beholder . But the important point is that because of Aeolian 's dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America in which musicians are free to tweak songs they like -- and they do so with great enthusiasm . Bob Dylan wrote \" All Along the Watchtower \" ; Jimi Hendrix turned it into something quite different and , arguably , made a great song even greater . Another 1960s classic , Van Morrison 's \" Gloria , \" has been covered by performers including Jimi Hendrix , the Doors , David Bowie , Tom Petty , Bruce Springsteen , Rickie Lee Jones , AC\/DC , and ( in perhaps the song 's most memorable and inventive reinterpretation ) Patti Smith . \" Gloria \" is an enduring song in part because so many legendary musicians have tweaked it . Cat Power , John Lennon , Willie Nelson , Paul Anka , and many other famous artists have issued albums of nothing but cover songs . All this legal copying has made our musical culture immeasurably richer . <p> Has the freedom to copy others ' songs , in exchange for a very low fee that the original songwriter has no power to override , suppressed the incentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , the opposite is true . Every day we see a continual outpouring of new songs . And many of the copied songs -- the covers -- are themselves incredibly creative . Think about jazz greats like Charlie Parker and John Coltrane . On one level , they are copying -- Coltrane 's version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein standard \" My Favorite Things \" relies on that song 's famous melody . But if Coltrane starts there , it 's certainly not where he ends up . By the song 's end , more than 13 minutes later , Coltrane has altered the original melody and taken it in a much darker , more contemplative direction . At some point in the song , Coltrane crosses the uncertain border that separates copyists from creators . <p> This kind of creative copying -- what we will call \" tweaking \" -- is not just a musical thing . It is present in all inventive fields . Perhaps the most important point about tweaking is this : Tweaking does not appear to lead to fewer original creations . If anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most significant and enduring innovations rest on tweaking . As Malcolm Gladwell has argued , the late Steve Jobs of Apple -- an icon of our innovation economy if there ever was one , and the man behind the iPhone and iPad -- \" was repeatedly referred to as a large-scale visionary and inventor . \" But in fact , \" he was much more a tweaker . \" <p> Jobs , Gladwell goes on to argue , was \" the greatest tweaker of his generation . \" Even the iPad , Jobs ' last great success , was a tweak of an idea out of Microsoft . And Gladwell rightly points out that the significance of tweaking to technological innovation is by no means a new thing : Economists debating the origins of the industrial revolution have claimed that the key reason Britain , and not France or Germany , was the first home of the industrial age was tweaking . As Gladwell describes their argument , Britain was not necessarily the home of path-breaking pioneers who created the foundational building blocks of the Industrial Revolution . Rather : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger population of skilled engineers and artisans than its competitors : resourceful and creative men who took the signature inventions of the industrial age and tweaked them -- refined and perfected them , and made them work . <p> In creating the cover song , the Congress of a century ago had no idea it would let loose one of the great innovative forces in music . It was just trying to repair a blunder by the Supreme Court and ensure that the giant Aeolian Co. did n't swallow the entire player piano market . Today , the player piano market is minuscule , and Aeolian has been dead for almost three decades . But the lesson of Aeolian lives on . Copying and creativity are not opposites -- they are often complements . Since there is nothing new under the sun , every creator relies , sometimes to a large degree , on what came before . <p> This should be obvious , but too often it is n't . Copying is viewed as a terrible thing , a crime and a killer of creativity . To be sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story shows , it can also be the key to new forms of creativity we never could have imagined . ",

        "text":"<h> A Mental-Health Expert Explains How to Stop the Next Elliot Rodger <p> Ideally , in the wake of a mass-killing tragedy like the Elliot Rodger murders from last weekend , society will at least come away with an insight or two about how to prevent the next one . Toward that end , Science of Us reached out to Jeffrey Rowe , clinical director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego ( and a psychiatry professor at UCSD ) , to ask how mental-health professionals separate young men who are merely troubled or upset from those who pose a genuine threat . <p> This is tricky , of course : There are a lot of quiet and\/or lonely and\/or taciturn young men out there , and many of them come across as creepy . The vast majority of them are n't a threat to anybody and grow up to be well- or relatively well-adjusted . Rowe 's recommendations , which he described as \" rough , \" are designed with this in mind . ( This is male-focused , because while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to engage in acts of mass violence . ) <p> It 's a two-stage process , he explained in an email . First comes an initial screening to determine \" who COULD be a danger at some point \" -- that is , who fits the basic profile of being potentially dangerous , even if the vast majority of people in this category wo n't end up harming anybody : <p> The screening would be all the things you read about -- male gender , socially poorly connected to others ( family , friends , co-workers , romantic connection ) , unsuccessful in school or vocation , isolated and ruminative ( hard to talk to , always going on about the same subject ) , angry , external locus of control ( my life would be better if other people would change their behavior ) while also being extremely egocentric . <p> Once they 've been identified , the next step is an assessment geared at determining whether a dangerous act is actually likely : <p> The assessment would include major risk factors and current symptoms -- risk factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) recent small crimes in which the rights and possessions of others are violated , ( 3 ) problematic use of drugs or alcohol , ( 4 ) acts of build-up ( writing , practicing or rehearsing , obtaining the methods for his future action ) , and ( 5 ) possession of weapons ; and then symptoms like ( 6 ) emotional arousal or outbursts in public , ( 7 ) evidence of illogical thought , ( 8 ) loss of reality testing , unusual distortions of perception ( hallucinations , grandiose delusions ) , and ( 9 ) end to doing of their usual activities ( hygiene , attending school or work , losing contact with those they usually do have some contact with ) . numbering mine <p> Now , surely when Rowe was laying this out , he had Rodger in the back of his head , but it 's still striking how neatly Rodger fits these criteria , at least based on his manifesto : <p> 1 . Yes . In addition to the fact that he felt humiliated by the mere presence of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was an incident in which he got really drunk , confronted some people at a party , and got beaten up . <p> 2 . Yes . Rodger outlines several instances in which he threw coffee on couples because he was so outraged that they ... well , existed . He also filled a Super Soaker with orange juice and sprayed down a group of young people . <p> 3 . Yes . By the time of the shooting he was engaging in some problem drinking , though he did n't recount any other drug use . <p> 4 . Yes . The manifesto itself , but also the planning he went through , the videos , and so on . <p> 5 . Yes . <p> 6 . Yes . <p> 7 . Yes . I would say that wishing to gain ultimate power over humanity so as to end the practice of sexual intercourse constitutes an \" illogical thought . \" There 's also his obsession with winning the lottery . <p> 8 . Sort of . There 's no evidence of hallucinations , but definitely some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady decline in his courseload and social interactions during high school and college , and he eventually becomes infuriated that World of Warcraft , his favorite video game and main sanctuary for many years , has become infested with \" normal \" people who do n't share his sorts of problems . <p> Obviously , the whole point here is that society ca n't access the private activities -- let alone the brain -- of Elliot Rodger and other troubled young men . But if more people knew what to look for , it might increase their odds of intervening and getting law enforcement or mental-health professionals involved when they encounter a friend or neighbor who exhibits these warning signs .

In developing countries , chiefly in Africa and Asia , some 200 million children under age 5 wo n't reach the same milestones -- for physical growth , school performance , and earnings later on -- as children who are less deprived . But a new analysis of a long-term study in Jamaica shows that surprisingly simple ways of stimulating children 's mental development can have dramatic benefits later in life . <p> The children were participants in the Jamaican Study , a project geared toward improving cognitive development begun in the mid-1980s by child health specialists Sally Grantham-McGregor of University College London and Susan Walker of the University of the West Indies , Mona , in Jamaica .

Children of normal height in the same neighborhoods were also studied for comparison . <p> For 2 years , community health workers visited the families weekly . One group was given nutritional assistance only ( a formula containing 66% of daily recommended calories , along with vitamins and minerals ) . One group received a mental and social stimulation program only , and one group got stimulation and nutritional assistance . A final group had no intervention and served as a control . The mental stimulation program involved giving parents simple picture books and handmade toys , and encouraging them to read and sing to their children and point out names of objects , shapes , and colors . They were also taught better ways to converse and respond to their toddlers . These everyday interactions are n't always part of the culture in low-income countries , explains Paul Gertler , an economist at the University of California , Berkeley . \" Parents might have five or six kids and few toys . They might be working really hard and have a lot of competing demands . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or how important and effective it is , \" he says . Past research attests to the importance of everyday conversation for children 's mental development : A recent study suggests that children of affluent parents do better in life in large part because their parents talk to them more . <p> Follow-up studies over the next 20 years revealed that the Jamaican children who received the mental stimulation had better grades and higher IQs , showed fewer signs of depression , and got in fewer fights . The new study , reported online today in Science , focused on the children 's economic achievement as young adults . Gertler , Grantham-McGregor , Walker , and colleagues tracked down 105 out of the original 129 growth-stunted children . Those who had received the stimulation intervention had earned 25% more than the children in the control group . Even more exciting , Gertler notes , is that they had closed the gap -- in physical and economic stature -- between themselves and children in their neighborhoods with normal height and weight . Adding nutritional assistance to the mental stimulation did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own had no effect -- likely because this kind of intervention must be used before a child 's growth has been stunted , Gertler says . <p> \" Mental and social stimulation at around 1 year of age really matter , \" Gertler says . \" It was enough to reduce and possibly eliminate inequality in the long term . \" Gertler emphasizes that the interventions were inexpensive , consisting of toys , books , and conversation -- not pricey , high-tech gadgets like iPads , for example . <p> Jere Behrman , an economist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research , says the study is the first to demonstrate a long-term economic benefit to early intervention stimulation programs in developing countries . But he is more cautious about saying that the program greatly reduces inequality . \" A 25% increase in earnings will improve the welfare of people who are very poor , and that 's something to be glad about .

The study provides proof that \" homemade toys and weekly visits from someone from within the community can also have a dramatic impact , \" Behrman says . <p> Joan Lombardi , who was deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from 2009 to 2011 and is now a senior adviser to the Bernard van Leer Foundation in The Hague , the Netherlands , says the study adds to the growing body of research from around the world confirming that what happens in the early years has an impact on long-term health , learning , and well-being . \" Investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" It 's time to translate this growing science into improved policies and new investments in young children and their families around the world . \" <p> *Clarification , 2 June , 11:29 a.m. : This article has been updated to clarify that according to Jere Behrman , the study is the first to demonstrate an economic benefit for early intervention programs that focus on mental and social stimulation in developing countries .

        "text":"<h> 7 traits of people who are great at relationships <h> Relating to your partner , spouse or significant other can be challenging . Here 's what the people who make it work know that you may not . <p> Most people in healthy relationships share a few key traits . ( Photo : Blend Images\/Shutterstock ) <p> By now , I hope that everyone has gotten the message that relationships are n't easy . If you expect that having a close , loving bond with another human being over the span of months or years is going to be all pretty relfies ( that 's a relationship selfie ) and sunshine , you will be hugely disappointed . <p> But a great romantic relationship , while needing care and feeding ( from both parties ) , should also be fun and joyful -- if it 's a drag to be with your beloved all the time , something 's wrong . Like many other things in life , some people are better at relationships than others . How do they do it ? Most of them share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accept their partners for who they are : Yes , people can change , but not all that much . So if you are constantly trying to motivate your spouse to do something small that they do n't want to do , like exercise more , or quit smoking , or be more assertive about their needs at work , that 's awesome , because that 's the kind of work partners should do for each other . Supporting each other in what we want to do in life is a beautiful thing . But the wholesale changing someone who , say , likes to surf more than she likes to work into a career-focused individual , trying to make a city guy into a country-living fan , or convincing someone who does n't want kids that they should have them is dangerous , and you 're bound to be disappointed when -- shocker -- they continue to be themselves . You can help your partner change small things about who they are , but if you are n't into a major aspect of someone 's personality , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't skimp on the snuggling : Like most mammals , human beings have a strong desire to be held and touched by the people closest to us -- regular physical connections are incredibly important , and that 's proven by science . According to a Psychology Today essay on the literature about affection and happiness , \" There was no connection between the amount of physical affection and amount of conflict for a couple , but cuddling\/holding , kissing on the lips , and hugging were all associated with how easily the couple resolves the conflict they do experience . \" <p> They really listen : Cultivating good listening skills is good for all kinds of relationships , from those with your siblings and parents to those with your friends . But so many people tune their spouses out -- the very people who need and deserve your focused attention . What 's a greater act of love than really taking the time to listen to what someone you love has to say ? <p> They do n't expect their partner to \" make them happy \" : Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do from the inside . Of course , you can ask for love and support from your partner to achieve goals that will make you happier , like request daily meditation time , or time off for a retreat , or whatever else you need to get to a happier place , but you are the only one ultimately responsible for your happiness . <p> They are generous : Being giving is a daily way to show love for your partner ; that does n't have to mean buying presents or expensive jewelry -- it does mean giving them the bigger slice of pie , bringing them a cup of tea , or rubbing their shoulders when they are stressed . Regular generosity shows your partner they are loved , in a small , quiet ways . <p> They talk it out -- and keep talking : Everyone always says \" honest communication is key \" -- but few do the work to make that a reality . Having fights or disagreements is natural and healthy . It 's what you do after them that matters . Talk it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really feel ) and listen closely . Keep going . Keep listening . Then keep talking , until whatever it is that made you angry or sad is past , and you are actually talking and listening about the deeper issues that got you fired up to begin with . This is real work ; it is hard , but it is incredibly rewarding , bringing you closer to your partner and bringing a greater understanding of yourself and them . <p> They are genuine : It 's easy to start a relationship based on a shiny-happy-perfect version of who you are ( who would n't be attracted to that ? ) . But it 's dishonest , and over the long term , you will have to keep up the facade ( not healthy , and exhausting ! ) . Or you will eventually show your true colors and have to renegotiate the relationship from the new perspective . Be yourself from the beginning and everyone will know what they are getting into . Yes , some people might not like you , and that 's really OK . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are theirs alone , and do not reflect the opinions of MNN.com .

        "text":"<h> Internet Of Things : 4 Areas IT Can Prep <p> Most IT groups are not ready for the Internet of Things . It 's time to get proactive -- or risk expensive missteps that will be difficult to fix . <p> 12 Tech Greats : Where Are They Now ? <p> ( Click image for larger view and slideshow . ) <p> Most IT organizations are woefully unprepared for the unprecedented management challenges that will come with the Internet of Things ( IoT ) . What 's that ? You say you 've negotiated the evolution from managing big iron within the four walls of a corporate data center to wrangling a messy mix of mobile devices and cloud resources , with only a few bumps along the way ? Congratulations . None of those changes holds a candle to what the IoT has in store . Here 's why . <p> First , the scale of the IoT far surpasses anything we 've seen . Cisco predicts 50 billion devices will be connected by 2020 . And the IoT will transform nearly every industry . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the test beds for even more powerful and sophisticated wearables aimed at addressing serious healthcare issues . The average new car already rolls with 60 microprocessors on board , and electronics account for 40% of the cost of making a car , according to the Center for Automotive Research . The advent of connected cars is dwarfed by the accelerating deployment of a new generation of sensors in trucks and other commercial vehicles aimed at improving their efficiency , safety , and profitability . <p> We also do n't have a lot of time . The commodization of sensor technology , growing broadband availability , and more readily available computing power and storage resources in the cloud are quickly combining to make the IoT a reality . <p> But the biggest reason most IT teams will be severely tested is n't about technology or time . It 's about the business , as product and service delivery groups attempt to respond to the escalating expectations created by the IoT phenomenon . <p> IT has heard for years how it needs to align IT initiatives with business goals . Yet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respondents actually spend time on that alignment . Forty-eight percent say they 'd like to help identify opportunities for competitive differentiation , but many are bogged down just keeping the lights on . <p> Make no mistake -- IT must be involved in all aspects of the IoT . This is not like a business unit purchasing SaaS or making a mobile app . Fulfilling the promise entails embedding technology ( sensors ) into products , making the products software-enabled ( APIs ) , and harnessing captured data to improve products and services continuously and make better business decisions ( big data analytics ) . Success requires that IT have an intimate understanding of product and service delivery requirements . <p> To get ready , IT must work with corporate executives and strategic business units in the following four areas . Fail to be proactive , and you risk expensive missteps that will be difficult to fix . Better do the IoT right the first time . <p> 1 . Connectivity : The IoT does n't work without the right type and scale of networks in place to connect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software . Is there enough bandwidth available in the geographies where your company intends to deploy its IoT initiatives ? What will it take to ensure sufficient connectivity to support your efforts ? If you 're not sure , work with business units to understand the geographic range of the objects and devices being monitored ; what kind of data they want to collect from the objects and devices ; and how they expect that data to support products , services , and corporate decision-making processes . These variables will have a significant impact on how IT calculates the bandwidth requirements to support the IoT initiative . <p> 2 . Integration : The IoT requires a supply chain of hardware , software , and service pieces , and no single vendor offers a vertically integrated system . IT must figure out which integration tools , techniques , and skills are necessary to pull together the various IoT pieces to satisfy your company 's functional requirements . Work with business units to establish criteria for selecting IoT sensors , software , and systems based on their APIs , compliance with industry standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater interoperability . <p> 3 . Security : The IoT is fraught with privacy and security risks . What regulatory , cultural , and practical areas must IT address to execute your company 's IoT ideas ? IT should work with business units to understand and prioritize security and privacy requirements and establish appropriate policies to support these mandates . You also need this information to develop IoT software and technology selection criteria . The last thing you want is to invest in a system and then find out it wo n't meet some obscure regulatory requirement . <p> 4 . Analytics : The IoT is all about data . How will you capture , store , collate , interpret , and share collected information to produce meaningful insights that can be translated into better products , services , and business results ? Work with business units to understand what data is most important , so you can prioritize what 's to be captured , analyzed , and shared -- internally and with customers , partners , and the broader marketplace . These objectives will shape the way the data is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporting software and systems necessary to use the data properly . <p> The idea of aligning IT with the business has never been more necessary than in the brave new world of the IoT . But do n't assume that means a smaller span of control ; in fact , the role of IT will never be broader than it has to be in the IoT world . <p> InformationWeek 's new Must Reads is a compendium of our best recent coverage of the Internet of Things . Find out the way in which an aging workforce will drive progress on the Internet of Things , why the IoT is n't as scary as some folks seem to think , how connected machines will change the supply chain , and more ( free registration required ) . <p> Jeff Kaplan is the Managing Director of THINKstrategies ( www.thinkstrategies.com ) , the only strategic consulting firm focused entirely on the business implications of the transition of the technology industry from a product-centric to a services-driven solution model , ... View Full Bio <p> I 'd be more concerned about the SBUs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consideration the various technical issues I outlined . The best scenario is for IT and the SBUs to work together from the start to set realistic expectations and fully address the potential issues before they derail their IoT efforts . <p> IoT does seem like the sort of tech that will tempt IT to do projects just because they can , and it 's cool . Without the deep integration with the business that you discuss , that could lead to a lot of wheel-spinning . <p> Or , IT could hit upon something truly innovative that LOB execs would never have thought of !

It 's helping to ease the pain of home prices that have climbed by one-third in Southern California over the last two years . <p> But at some point -- and fairly soon , forecasters say -- these cheap money days will end . When they do , the stop-and-start housing recovery could face the kind of hurdle it has n't seen in a long time . <p> Low rates have propped up the housing market for years now . But with the Federal Reserve ending its so-called \" quantitative easing \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many market watchers are predicting rates will start to rise again soon . This time next year , the Mortgage Bankers Assn. projects , the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will be 5.2% , its highest level since early 2010 . <p> At today 's 4.1% rate , the monthly payment on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with 20% down at Los Angeles County 's median price of $457,500 would be $1,768 , according to Bankrate.com 's mortgage calculator . Add a point and the monthly payment climbs to $2,009 . <p> That extra $241 a month is no small thing for a housing market that 's already struggling with affordability issues , said Leslie Appleton-Young , chief economist at the California Assn. of Realtors . <p> \" It 's going to worsen affordability , \" she said . \" All else remaining the same , higher rates are going to make it more difficult for people to get into housing . \" <p> And coming after years of low rates -- when many homeowners either bought a house with a relatively cheap mortgage or refinanced into one -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly tight by historical standards . <p> Roughly half of the nation 's 50 million home mortgages have interest rates at or below the current rates , said Mark Fleming , chief economist at real estate data firm CoreLogic . So if rates go up , buying anew would mean a more costly mortgage . <p> \" That means you do n't have a lot of incentive to sell your home , \" he said . \" That could lead to a lack of supply going forward . \" <p> It would be the reverse of a broader trend the housing market has enjoyed for 30 years now , Fleming notes , a period when interest rates have moved generally downward from 18% in the early 1980s to as low as 3% early last year . In that time , he said , tens of millions of people have been able to sell a house and buy a new one at a cheaper interest rate , essentially getting more house for the same money .

Tight supply could well boost prices , Fleming notes , which could be a bigger incentive to sell than the higher rates are a deterrent to buy . If rates rise quickly , it 's likely a sign of inflation and wage growth , which could help more people afford a house . And people will buy and sell houses for all the non-financial reasons they always have , from growing families to new jobs to simply wanting to move . <p> \" Will it be more difficult ? Yes .

This shift to digital is driving an unprecedented number of customers to websites and landing pages . This is also creating new problems and bigger opportunities for entrepreneurs that can figure out how to effectively respond to these prospects . <p> How big is the opportunity ? Well , have you ever reached out to a business 's website , filled out a form showing interest only to be completely ignored ? Of course you have . In fact , 65 percent of all companies admit that they have no process to nurture leads . <p> I recently created a mystery-shop campaign to show companies just how big this problem and opportunity is . Three companies with three completely different products hired me to evaluate their website response and sales teams . <p> One was a luxury jewelry store , another a large group of automotive dealerships , and the third was a service company . The automobile dealership sent an automated response to the lead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . <p> Having looked into this follow-up problem , I can tell you it is massive . Did you know 44 percent of all sales people give up after one follow-up call ? Who allows this to happen ? Companies that nurture leads have 47 percent higher profit margins than companies that do not . This means prospects put the value on quick response , not on lowest price . <p> Smaller businesses and solo entrepreneurs often point the finger to limited infrastructure to handle follow up , but the reality is if you are a small-business owner , this is where you need to invest . I know what it 's like to be a one-man show because I was one for too many years . But in order to survive , I made sure I followed up fast and over long periods of time . <p> Why do salespeople and companies fail to follow up ? My company surveyed over 800 sales people and 500 businesses that said they do n't follow up because there are too many leads , leads are cold by the time they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow up . <p> The reality is there is no commitment to follow up . The culture of your company has made it OK not to follow up . Now , in defense of the sales team , if your salespeople do n't know how to effectively follow up , what to say , how to text , when to email , when to call , when to offer more information or simple things like how to get the lead on the phone , then how can you even make a second call , much less the five to 12 calls necessary to convert the Internet lead to a purchase ?

        "title":"Leverage the in-memory capabilities of SQL Server 2014 for better ...\n",
        "text":"<h> From <h> Thank you <h> Sorry <p> SQL Server 2014 provides a comprehensive high-end database solution that can meet the emerging demands of the businesses and enterprises alike . It marks the release of Microsoft 's flagship database product that provides you a platform for hybrid cloud - you can now build , deploy and manage your databases that reside both on premise as well as in the cloud . SQL Server 2014 includes many interesting new features . One of such new features is the new OLTP engine . <p> I was intrigued on reading and exploring the in-memory capabilities of SQL Server 2014 . Microsoft 's SQL Server 2014 promises to reap the benefits of 64-bit computing . The in-memory capabilities in SQL Server 2014 is facilitated by the In-Memory OLTP Engine -- it 's integrated right into SQL Server 2014 . This engine is code named as \" Hekaton \" and is an in-built feature in SQL Server 2014 . Hakaton is a Greek word that implies \" 100 \" . Microsoft 's SQL Server 2014 was earlier code named as Hekaton because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . The MSDN states : \" New in SQL Server 2014 , In-Memory OLTP can significantly improve OLTP database application performance . In-Memory OLTP is a memory-optimized database engine integrated into the SQL Server engine , optimized for OLTP . \" ( Reference ) <p> To use memory optimized tables in SQL Server 2014 , all of the following requirements should be fulfilled : <p> 1 . ) SQL Server 2014 ( 64-bit ) Enterprise or Developer or Evaluation version installed2 . ) You should have enough memory to allow for storing memory optimized database tables and indexes3 . ) You should have enough of free disk space - preferably twice the size of your memory optimized tables4. ) 64-bit processor to support the instruction cmpxchg16b to use In-Memory OLTP should be available <p> One of the most important differentiators amongst SQL Server 2014 and its earlier counterparts is in the former 's support for in-memory database tables . When our computer systems go slow we often increase the physical memory in the system so that you would get more RAM . Increasing memory does improve the performance to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem always primarily because you need to know whether the microprocessor would support the amount of memory installed in your system , etc . <p> The newly introduced In-Memory OLTP engine in SQL Server 2014 enables you to create in-memory tables and then perform input output operations ( I\/O ) against them in memory . Performing I\/O operations against these in-memory tables result in faster reads and writes as your application can read from and write to the memory much faster compared to disk reads and writes . In essence , with SQL Server 2014 you can now move your database tables into memory for lower latency and improved performance.To enable your database to support in-memory OLTP , you should add a filegroup for the memory optimized data and also add a container to the filegroup you added . <p> Considering that you have a database named infoworld , here 's the script that you need to execute to enable this support . <p> Note that any database in SQL Server 2014 that uses memory-optimized data must have at least one file group associated .

But it might not be that simple . <p> Working in Polamalu 's favor is the fact that he 's an incredibly talented guy who did some bananas thing on the football field . There are few combinations of athleticism and instinct in NFL history as Polamalu . He consistently managed to make plays most people ca n't while ending up in places on the field he had no business being in . <p> For all the amazing things Polamalu did on the field , there are more than a few factors working against him as a first-ballot Hall of Famer . <p> Talent Around Him : We detailed the death of the Steelers great defense earlier on Friday . Polamalu was essentially the last guy out the door in Pittsburgh . And while he was the centerpiece of the Steelers defensive rise there were more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> James Harrison , LaMarr Woodley , James Farrior and Larry Foote at linebacker make a safety 's job easier . So do Aaron Smith , Brett Keisel and Casey Hampton on the defensive line . If you 're a great quarterback on a great offense , you 're ( understandably ) getting more credit than the great player on a great defense . <p> Safety Struggles : Only 24 defensive backs are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame , a surprisingly low number , especially when you consider the number of coaches ( 22 ) and contributors ( 21 ) enshrined . Of those 24 , only 6 are \" true \" safeties , with another four qualifying on the Hall 's site as hybrid CB\/S types . Aeneas Williams ( class of 2014 ) was the most recent inductee and needed 10 years after he finished playing to make Canton . The last pure safety to get in was Willie Wood from the class of 1989 . <p> Durability : Polamalu 's insane , attacking style of play often led to him delivering fierce blows to opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 12 seasons , Polamalu only played a full 16 games in five years . ( It 's a testament to his talent that Polamalu 's average Approximate Value , even with injuries and a limited rookie season , was 9.75 . ) He could be dinged for missing games . <p> Logjam : Here 's the biggest issue . The problem with calling someone a \" first-ballot \" guy is to qualify as such you had to be so freaking good at football that you can leap any number of your peers or predecessors who are waiting in line to finally get into the hall . <p> For example , Brett Favre will jump to the front of the line when he 's eligible . Most guys , no matter the production , wo n't be afforded the freedom to chat and cut . <p> So you have to look at the players still eligible when Polamalu hits the HOF market in 2020 . We might be staring at \" one receiver a year \" for a while now with Marvin Harrison , Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce eligible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) coming soon . Tim Brown continues to linger . <p> Kurt Warner will be in by then but he Favre are just going to push two more candidates into the future . <p> Ed Reed will be eligible a year before Polamalu and will give us a fantastic litmus test to whether or not Troy cruises in . Some might argue Reed 's the better safety . How the Hall treats John Lynch and Brian Dawkins ( 2017 ) will be interesting to see . <p> Polamalu is a Hall of Fame safety . He 'll get in . And it 's possible he gets in immediately , especially given the fondness of the media for him as a player and a person ( it helps regardless of what anyone says ) .

But she came away from the ordeal uninjured , telling a story about meeting Jesus in heaven , and she suddenly tested symptom-free . <p> Annabel 's mother , Christy Wilson Beam , has come to the conclusion that miracle is the only word that applies when explaining Annabel 's recovery . <p> Annabel 's Boston-based gastroenterologist , Dr. Samuel Nurko , did n't call it a miracle , but he did release the girl from his care last November , noting that she \" is completely asymptomatic , is leading a normal life and is not requiring any therapies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Miracles From Heaven .

In all areas of her life , she is above and beyond . <p> Have you ever been given a sound scientific explanation for what prompted her recovery ? <p> They really do n't know . My husband , Kevin , is a veterinarian and very scientifically minded . He went over everything , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Annabel 's problems involved nerve damage .

        "text":"<h> Shaky Knees 2015 Festival Review : From Worst to Best <h> It was a sizzling three-day weekend in Hotlanta . <h> Share this : <p> Two years ago , event promoter Tim Sweetwood turned heads nationwide when he opened the gates to Shaky Knees Festival in Atlanta 's cozy Historic Fourth Ward Park . The two-day lineup topped by The Lumineers , Band of Horses , and Drive-By Truckers attracted both locals and out-of-towners and proved successful enough for a return . \" I was n't trying to be Bonnaroo or Coachella , \" Sweetwood explained to Ryan Bray back in February . \" It was n't like we were reaching for the sky . I just wanted to show people what I could do as far as my vision . \" <p> The following year , the festival expanded to three days , nabbed heavy hitters like Alabama Shakes , The National , Modest Mouse , and a reunited The Replacements , and shifted the action over to Atlantic Station . Weather issues aside , the sprawling concrete parking lot accommodated the expansive crowds with ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outdoor mall and expect to have any charm or character . When Paul Westerberg 's singing \" Left of the Dial \" and an Old Navy sign is looming beside the stage , it 's a little hard to lose yourself . <p> Photo by Debi Del Grande <p> Yet , Sweetwood 's a smart guy , and he reckoned with these issues . \" You do n't want to do the same festival every year , \" he continued . \" You want to grow aesthetically , and you have to make sure your booking is on point so fans are just as excited as they were the year before . \" And so , the young man 's quest to bring a proper music festival to the Southern metropolis has arrived at its most exciting ( and pivotal ) chapter yet : it 's finally found a home . Who knew it was just a shade away from downtown at a chunk of grass called Central Park . <p> Prior to Mother 's Day weekend -- a trait that Sweetwood digs ( \" Everyone has a mom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concern that the festivities would overwhelm the area and the smallish , family-friendly park . That might have been the case if the festival did n't also take advantage of the adjoining Renaissance Park and the nearby parking lot for the Atlanta Civic Center . Unlike last year 's sprawl , this lot is framed by grassy hills and enough foliage to shadow as an expansion to the corresponding parks . Needless to say , there was a lack of suburbanites walking by with groceries . <p> Photo by Debi Del Grande <p> The setup was very similar to how Lollapalooza takes over Chicago 's Grant Park . It was all in sections and fragments that were tied together by a united street ( in this case , Pine ) . This added a much longer walk between the stages than years prior , but it was efficient enough and also suggested that Shaky Knees may be larger than Sweetwood ever intended . Like any of the Big Four fests , he 's created a city within a city , and there 's reason to believe that his vision has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a music festival but a destination music festival . <p> That revelation might frighten him . <p> \" Know that we 're committed to getting better each year , and not necessarily bigger either , \" he contended . \" The end goal is to sell out as a festival , but at half the capacity of the Bonnaroos and the Coachellas so that everyone there can enjoy it . We want the guy who is standing 20 feet back from the stage to enjoy it as much as the guy who is standing 200 feet back from the stage . <p> Photo by Carlo Cavaluzzi <p> \" It 's a business , do n't get me wrong , \" he added . \" The business needs to be profitable , but when your business gets too big , sometimes it 's harder to service the ticket buyer in a way that 's really satisfying . I think if we keep things running at a medium level , we can give our fans what they 're looking for . \" <p> Based on the crowds , which were never too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear that Shaky Knees might simply be walking with shoes one size too big . If that 's sustainable , excellent . Save for the notoriously long lines at the dozen local food trucks -- pretty much the only outlet for food , which is definitely a good thing -- there really were n't any hiccups in Sweetwood 's current design . The monitors at the main stage were state-of-the-art , the Buford Tent was a godsend , and the various ice pops were tasty blessings . <p> Photo by Carlo Cavaluzzi <p> Whether or not Sweetwood wants the growth is up for him to decide , but if he 's game , he 's certainly not alone . There were good vibes all weekend , supported and kept alive by a sea of people hungry for an honest music festival . If he 's smart , he 'll keep feeding ' em . And well . <p> So , what about the music ? Click ahead to see the worst and the best of the fest . Just know that \" worst \" is simply a designation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

        "text":"<h> Jon Hamm and the Cruel Summer of Celebrity Breakups <p> Our worst fears were confirmed this Labor Day weekend when Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt told People on Monday that their rumored split was , in fact , real . \" With great sadness , we have decided to separate , after 18 years of love and shared history , \" the former favorite couple of Mad Men fans and feminists said in a statement . \" We will continue to be supportive of each other in every way possible moving forward . \" <p> Once , we hoped the summer reports of the two being seen together at Netflix 's Wet Hot American Summer : First Day of Camp \" canoodling \" -- such a mischeviously , deceptively vaue phrase to toy with our hearts -- were true . Now , we weep and dread the arrival of the tabloid covers splashing images of \" lonely \" Jennifer or Jon hitting the town with some new squeeze ( Jon , do n't you dare ) . <p> Typically , that wretched space between Thanksgiving and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer is proving otherwise . Countless couples once considered rock-solid by Hollywood standards have hit the skids . <p> As painful as it is for those actually going through these separations , we can not help but also burst into tears and go running for Kleenex and H ? agen-Dazs . <p> When our models of romance -- the people who give us hope that genuinely happy relationships can survive in a modern world -- crumble , how are we , their adoring fans , to cope ? We know to some this amounts to a pretty weird investment in people 's lives we do not know , but there we go . Indulge us . <p> There is something painfully fitting about the Westfeldt-Hamm breakup announcement coming at the unofficial end of the summer--a season that has been filled with an unending stream of broken celebrity hearts . <p> Below is our rundown of summer breakups with directions for how to properly mourn . <p> According to Star magazine , it was n't Hamm 's alcohol addiction that was the problem , but Westfeldt 's desire to have children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same things . \" <p> Not since Amy Poehler and Will Arnett called it quits have we so questioned the bounds of love and monogamy . <p> If these two wildly endearing celebrities are can no longer charm the pants off each other ( literally ) , what hope is there for the rest of us ? <p> Hamm and Westfeldt have been together for 18 years . They began dating in 1997 , a decade before Mad Men made Don Draper a household name and the ultimate television heartthrob . <p> Danny Moloshok \/ Reuters <p> If the sexiest man on cable was n't going to personally sweep us off our feet , Westfeldt was the ideal surrogate for our fantasies . Dare we say it , she was almost relatable , or at least insanely admirable . <p> Sure , Westfeldt is still remarkably attractive in that unattainable Hollywood way . But she is also an age-appropriate match -- in fact , she 's a year older than Hamm -- and a successful , intelligent creative force in her own right . <p> Amal Clooney may be rocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kissing Jessica Stein and Friends With Kids did it first . Snaps for Westfeldt . <p> In turn , we respected Hamm all the more for choosing such a fine mate when every Betty , Joan , and Peggy came his way after Don Draper became a household name . <p> And now this charismatic coupling is no more . Sigh . <p> Do not under any circumstances cry for this couple . We 're not talking about Bogie and Bacall here . <p> Should this make us want to give up on romance ? On love ? On meaningful connections with intelligent adults ? Probably . Pass the damn ice cream . <p> How sad should you be ? <p> Can you be more physically distraught than devastated ? If so , aim for that . <p> Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy <p> We know in our heads that the Kermit-Piggy split was all for the best . She 's a proudly independent woman and pig , and Kermit was always a bit spineless , anyways . <p> Whenever they appeared together , their relationship appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for how long could that unhealthy dynamic sustain a relationship ? This was a proudly abusive relationship -- which we laughed at . <p> Then again , Kermit and Piggy were one of our earliest models of romance . Aside from our parents ( and maybe not even them ) , they served as one of the most reliable examples of a loving partnership in our lives . <p> Gary Hershorn \/ Reuters <p> Kermit and Piggy did not specify why they 've chosen to call it quits , only noting in their statement that \" our personal lives are now distinct and separate and we will be seeing other people , pigs , frogs , et al . \" <p> With the new Muppets show premiering on ABC in the fall , part of us wonders ( hopes ) that this is all cruel publicity stunt . <p> Then again , Kermit revealed he is dating someone in the marketing department at ABC named Denise . <p> Even though their split appears to be quite amicable , we 're still brokenhearted . <p> Who else in the Muppets brigade will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> How sad should you be ? <p> Somewhere between \" very \" and \" incredibly . \" In fact , why do you even need to be instructed ? We 're talking about one of the great Hollywood romances . We 're talking about love across animal kingdoms . We 're talking ... everything . <p> But then , take a deep breath , wipe your eyes , and carry on . This summer split should not shake you to the core . <p> Yes , we were all thrilled to see Affleck with Garner after his disastrous professional and personal foray into the world of J. Lo . ( Actually , that was amazing and made him seem more interesting . ) But Affleck and Garner soon became a more conventional pair of American sweethearts . <p> Danny Moloshok\/Reuters <p> Yet , while we hate to sound cynical , the end of Bennifer 2.0 was a long time coming . Affleck 's ( in ) famous Academy Award speech in 2013 when he said marriage was \" work \" was n't the red flag . That was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was when they got a little too precious and cutesy about their relationship that the hazard lights started flashing . <p> According to New York 's The Cut , Garner seemed a little too eager to gush about Affleck 's parenting skills to the press last fall . <p> She cooed to InStyle , \" No matter how much I tickle them or toss them or chase them around , it 's not the same . If I 'm the slow , steady drumbeat , he 's the jazz . \" <p> Neither of these picture-bait stories seem like conclusive evidence of an affair , but if it 's true that Affleck has already moved on , it only affirms that ending his and Garner 's marriage was a bittersweet , but ultimately right , move . <p> How sad should you be ? <p> Moderately and for a measured period of time . Then you should rouse yourself into action and root for Garner to bounce back with a hot younger man . <p> Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani <p> The rock star couple is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer 's rate , there will be a new one by the time this goes to press . <p> We 'd like to say we 're surprised by the split , but we 're more surprised Stefani and Rossdale lasted as long as they did . <p> Eric Gaillard\/Reuters <p> The couple wed in 2002 as a match made in rock band heaven . From that point on Stefani 's fame only grew . She branched out from No Doubt to start her own musical projects , launch a fashion line , and become a judge on NBC 's The Voice . <p> Meanwhile , Rossdale was making more headlines for scandals . In 2004 , it was revealed that his goddaughter Daisy Lowe was actually his biological daughter , a product of an affair with singer Pearl Lowe when she was married . <p> A bigger threat to their marriage hit the rumor mill when Courtney Love claimed Rossdale cheated on Stefani with her . <p> In 2009 , Rossdale confirmed he had a sexual relationship with British drag queen Marilyn in the 1980s -- an admission that Marilyn is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RadarOnline.com that Rossdale called him weeks before Stefani officially filed , launching into an emotional tirade where he blamed Marilyn for revealing their affair . \" Gwen wants him to be something he 's not , and he wants to be something he 's not . That 's my interpretation , \" Marilyn said . <p> It 's not like Stefani and Rossdale 's marriage was all bumps and bruises . Rossdale and Stefani had three sons -- Kingston , 9 , Zuma , 6 , and Apollo , 17 months -- and they oozed rock star sexiness on the red carpet . <p> Still , the couple was up against a lot of odds to work . Even Stefani admitted to Cosmopolitan in February of this year that it was \" miracle \" she and Rossdale were still together . We could n't agree more . <p> How sad should you be ? <p> A little , but do n't cry too much for the Rossdale-Stefani split . Applaud them for a good run and call it a day -- and hope that their absence of a pre-nup wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to the rest of the family , they were a paragon of relationship stability . <p> Kourtney remains the only Kardashian sister who has never walked down the aisle . However , her on-again , off-again relationship with Disick lasted longer than each of Kim 's and Khlo ? ' s marriages -- and , for those of you keeping count , they have four between them . <p> That does n't mean Kardashian and Disick ever won over reality TV audiences . Disick seemed like a tempest in a teapot , more in an irritating than entertaining way . <p> Disick is already expressing his regret over the split in a suspiciously public fashion . <p> On Instagram , he shared photo of a table card reading \" Scott Disick guest \" with the caption \" When u realize the grass is n't always greener . \" But the public plea for his baby mama seems more like a public plea for attention . <p> Knowing the Kardashian clan and their fame-loving straphangers , we would n't be surprised if the split was a publicity stunt . <p> Disick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family back . \" <p> How sad should you be ? <p> We 're not talking about Bogie and Bacall here . Do not cry , because this breakup could end up being shorter than Kim Kardashian 's marriage to Kris Humphries . <p> Zayn Malik and Perrie Edwards <p> If you squander more than a three-second shrug on this breakup , I only have four words for you : Pull it together , dude . <p> In case you have a life , here are the details . He was in One Direction , she was in a girl band called , puzzlingly , Little Mix . He called off their engagement , she is \" devastated . \" Us Weekly reports that friends of Edwards say it 's a miracle she put with Malik 's erratic behavior for so long . This will run and run , believe us . <p> Yes , Malik and Edwards have been together for two years and were even engaged . But each is only 22 years old . At that age , the biggest life decision you should be making is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be realistic : Ending things before they walked down the aisle probably spared them of an even more painful romantic demise . <p> Also , they are the kind of couple where their youth and hotness is only exceeded by their wealth . They are awash in sexual and materialistic comfort . They do not need your sympathy pains . <p> How sad should you be ? <p> Not . At . All . This is so not the couple you shed tears over , especially in a summer rife with heartbreak that makes us question the human condition and the frailty of love . ",

But if audiences at Toronto are rallying around a single festival favorite , they have n't shared that knowledge with the critics . <p> Instead , the buzz at Toronto -- a festival where awards-season buzz usually seems shot out of a cannon in every direction -- has been a bit more scattershot , with some affection for Johnny Depp in Black Mass in one corner , some passionate supporters of Beasts of No Nation or Anomalisa in another , and a lot of people very excited about Spotlight , who still ca n't help but wonder if it 's too straightforward and smart for general audiences .

Already the leading actor and actress races are looking ungodly crowded : safe early bets like Depp , Matt Damon ( The Martian ) , Idris Elba ( Beasts of No Nation ) , and Brie Larson ( Room ) were warmly received , while some surprises emerged , like Alicia Vikander 's commanding lead role in The Danish Girl , Helen Mirren 's salty portrayal of Hedda Hopper in Trumbo , or Sandra Bullock 's engaging blend of comedy and tough dramatics in Our Brand Is Crisis . But all of those films and actors were , on some level , already on the Hollywood radar ; so far there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore seemingly out of nowhere into the best-actress race ( and , eventually , a win ) . <p> There are many , many promising movies left to come in the fall , and a few -- Todd Haynes'sCarol chief among them -- that have already screened at other festivals but skipped Toronto . And the lack of a consensus favorite at Toronto likely points to a more interesting awards season ahead , avoiding a situation where something like 12 Years a Slave or The Artist marches steadily from a splashy Toronto premiere to a seemingly inevitably best-picture win . For the first time in a few years , the awards race still seems fairly open even with Toronto 's premieres wrapping up .

The ranch at Sunset and Pecos roads in Las Vegas is scheduled to open for public tours on Friday . ( David Becker\/Las Vegas Review-Journal ) <p> And for anybody who 's driven past the gates of Wayne Newton 's estate near the corner of Sunset and Pecos roads and wondered what lay behind , finding out firsthand now is possible . <p> You can check out the photo gallery above , or , starting Friday , the entertainer will offer public tours of his longtime Las Vegas estate . In addition to viewing Newton 's car collection , stage outfits that go back to his childhood and gifts presented to him by other legendary entertainers , guests can view his prize-winning Arabian horses , his menagerie of animals and the 52-acre ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fans and followers of Newton may be surprised that the estate is available for viewing at all . For the past several years , the property has been the focus of a legal battle between Newton and investors . Last fall , the property even had been put up for sale . <p> Earlier this week , Newton said that he and the partners have settled their differences . <p> \" What we have done , the entire property is ours . We 've leased it for more years than I 'll ever see , and with the right and predetermined figure , which I ca n't go into , should we decide that we wanted to buy it back , that 's the figure and it 's a done deal , \" Newton said . <p> Newton , who moved to Las Vegas in 1959 , purchased the first five acres of the estate in 1966 . The first house on the property -- the one in which Newton , his parents and his brother then lived -- was built between 1966 and 1968 . Newton purchased additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , construction of the property 's mansion began . It was completed in 1976 . <p> Today , the estate has eight residences , habitat for a variety of animals and birds and several natural ponds . It also has two barns with stalls for Newton 's 60 purebred Arabian horses and three horse arenas . <p> Guests will start at a visitors center across the street from the estate . There , they can purchase tickets for the tour -- packages range from $35 to $95 for adults -- view a film about Newton , and take home a Newton or Casa de Shenandoah souvenir , home decor , apparel and gift items from Kat 's Corner , named for Newton 's wife , Kathleen , or children 's items and pet accessories from Lauren 's Lair , named for Newton 's daughter , with proceeds going to Opportunity Village . <p> Visitors who opt to take the estate tour will board shuttles for a ride into the estate . There , they can view museum cases and displays containing mementos from Newton 's performing career , which began when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display are stage costumes he wore as a kid , one of which features , Newton notes , fringe his mother took from a drape . <p> Newton , in the form of recorded video played on high-definition screens , serves as tour guide . Several exhibits feature Newton 's long career as celebrity ambassador for the USO , traveling the United States and the world to entertain American troops . <p> In person , Newton is an affable tour guide who possesses both great stories and a knack for telling them , even if the military-related photos and mementos can resurrect memories laden with emotion . <p> Once while visiting troops in Vietnam -- Newton notes that he has visited troops in every U.S. conflict since Vietnam -- \" I came down with a bad case of the flu , \" he recalls . He asked the nurse who was treating him if he could contact anybody on her behalf back home , just to \" let them know I saw you and that you 're doing great and you 're very happy doing your job . \" <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks later , he made the call and learned from the mother that her daughter had been killed the previous week in a helicopter crash . <p> \" Well , my throat went to my stomach , as you can imagine , and I still get choked up to this day when I tell this story , \" Newton says . <p> \" I said , ' I 'm so sorry to bother you at a time like this . ' She said , ' No , no , no , no , no . I 've been waiting for this call . ' She said , ' Had you not called , it would have been the most devastating thing that could have happened , ' notwithstanding losing her , ' because you 're the last person that saw her happy and vivacious , doing what she loved doing , and no mother wants to hear more than that . So please do n't feel bad about calling . ' \" <p> Newton pauses . \" It 's those kind of moments that will last me the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton has collected over the years , including movie memorabilia and gifts presented to him by other legendary performers , including Nat King Cole , Jack Benny and Elvis Presley . There 's even an old-fashioned microphone from Frank Sinatra , inscribed to \" Injun \" -- \" He always called me that , \" says Newton , who has Native American roots -- that says , \" I got started with one of these when you were a papoose . Much love ... \" <p> Visitors can view Newton 's car collection -- he 's partial to Rolls-Royces and Bentleys -- which includes cars once owned by Johnny Cash and Liberace , and walk inside a private jet Newton used for several years . <p> Unlike some celebrity private jets , Newton 's bears no name on its front . \" I was going to call it ' Lauren , ' after my daughter , and my wife looked at me and says , ' Should n't it be named after me ? ' And the answer to that is , ' Of course , darling , ' \" Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to naming it . \" <p> During their tour of the grounds , guests can see the Arabian horses Newton breeds . \" Our horses have produced over 96 national champions , \" says Newton , who admits that , in Europe , some know him better as a horse breeder than as an entertainer . <p> Guests can see the exotic animals -- including a Capuchin monkey named Boo , a pair of penguins , birds and wallabies -- who share the estate , and view the manicured lawns , lush landscaping and spring-fed ponds that dot it . Guests who opt for higher-tiered tours also will get a peek into the estate 's mansion . <p> Newton says that , when he bought the first parcel of what would become Casa de Shenandoah , he envisioned that it someday would become the working ranch\/estate it is now . He 's excited about sharing it all with fans . <p> \" It 's been a challenge , to say the least , \" Newton says . \" But it 's all come together , and it 's come together beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that says it all . \" <h> Comment section guidelines <p> The below comment section contains thoughts and opinions from users that in no way represent the views of the Las Vegas Review-Journal or GateHouse Media .

( david becker\/las vegas review-journal ) <p> and for anybody who 's driven past the gates of wayne newton 's estate near the corner of sunset and pecos roads and wondered what lay behind , finding out firsthand now is possible . <p> you can check out the photo gallery above , or , starting friday , the entertainer will offer public tours of his longtime las vegas estate . in addition to viewing newton 's car collection , stage outfits that go back to his childhood and gifts presented to him by other legendary entertainers , guests can view his prize-winning arabian horses , his menagerie of animals and the 52-acre ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> fans and followers of newton may be surprised that the estate is available for viewing at all . for the past several years , the property has been the focus of a legal battle between newton and investors . last fall , the property even had been put up for sale . <p> earlier this week , newton said that he and the partners have settled their differences . <p> \" what we have done , the entire property is ours . we 've leased it for more years than i 'll ever see , and with the right and predetermined figure , which i ca n't go into , should we decide that we wanted to buy it back , that 's the figure and it 's a done deal , \" newton said . <p> newton , who moved to las vegas in 1959 , purchased the first five acres of the estate in 1966 . the first house on the property -- the one in which newton , his parents and his brother then lived -- was built between 1966 and 1968 . newton purchased additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , construction of the property 's mansion began . it was completed in 1976 . <p> today , the estate has eight residences , habitat for a variety of animals and birds and several natural ponds . it also has two barns with stalls for newton 's 60 purebred arabian horses and three horse arenas . <p> guests will start at a visitors center across the street from the estate . there , they can purchase tickets for the tour -- packages range from $35 to $95 for adults -- view a film about newton , and take home a newton or casa de shenandoah souvenir , home decor , apparel and gift items from kat 's corner , named for newton 's wife , kathleen , or children 's items and pet accessories from lauren 's lair , named for newton 's daughter , with proceeds going to opportunity village . <p> visitors who opt to take the estate tour will board shuttles for a ride into the estate . there , they can view museum cases and displays containing mementos from newton 's performing career , which began when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display are stage costumes he wore as a kid , one of which features , newton notes , fringe his mother took from a drape . <p> newton , in the form of recorded video played on high-definition screens , serves as tour guide . several exhibits feature newton 's long career as celebrity ambassador for the uso , traveling the united states and the world to entertain american troops . <p> in person , newton is an affable tour guide who possesses both great stories and a knack for telling them , even if the military-related photos and mementos can resurrect memories laden with emotion . <p> once while visiting troops in vietnam -- newton notes that he has visited troops in every u.s. conflict since vietnam -- \" i came down with a bad case of the flu , \" he recalls . he asked the nurse who was treating him if he could contact anybody on her behalf back home , just to \" let them know i saw you and that you 're doing great and you 're very happy doing your job . \" <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks later , he made the call and learned from the mother that her daughter had been killed the previous week in a helicopter crash . <p> \" well , my throat went to my stomach , as you can imagine , and i still get choked up to this day when i tell this story , \" newton says . <p> \" i said , ' i 'm so sorry to bother you at a time like this . ' she said , ' no , no , no , no , no . i 've been waiting for this call . ' she said , ' had you not called , it would have been the most devastating thing that could have happened , ' notwithstanding losing her , ' because you 're the last person that saw her happy and vivacious , doing what she loved doing , and no mother wants to hear more than that . so please do n't feel bad about calling . ' \" <p> newton pauses . \" it 's those kind of moments that will last me the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newton has collected over the years , including movie memorabilia and gifts presented to him by other legendary performers , including nat king cole , jack benny and elvis presley . there 's even an old-fashioned microphone from frank sinatra , inscribed to \" injun \" -- \" he always called me that , \" says newton , who has native american roots -- that says , \" i got started with one of these when you were a papoose . much love ... \" <p> visitors can view newton 's car collection -- he 's partial to rolls-royces and bentleys -- which includes cars once owned by johnny cash and liberace , and walk inside a private jet newton used for several years . <p> unlike some celebrity private jets , newton 's bears no name on its front . \" i was going to call it ' lauren , ' after my daughter , and my wife looked at me and says , ' should n't it be named after me ? ' and the answer to that is , ' of course , darling , ' \" newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to naming it . \" <p> during their tour of the grounds , guests can see the arabian horses newton breeds . \" our horses have produced over 96 national champions , \" says newton , who admits that , in europe , some know him better as a horse breeder than as an entertainer . <p> guests can see the exotic animals -- including a capuchin monkey named boo , a pair of penguins , birds and wallabies -- who share the estate , and view the manicured lawns , lush landscaping and spring-fed ponds that dot it . guests who opt for higher-tiered tours also will get a peek into the estate 's mansion . <p> newton says that , when he bought the first parcel of what would become casa de shenandoah , he envisioned that it someday would become the working ranch\/estate it is now . he 's excited about sharing it all with fans . <p> \" it 's been a challenge , to say the least , \" newton says . \" but it 's all come together , and it 's come together beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that says it all . \" <h> comment section guidelines <p> the below comment section contains thoughts and opinions from users that in no way represent the views of the las vegas review-journal or gatehouse media . this public platform is intended to provide a forum for users of reviewjournal.com to share ideas , express thoughtful opinions and carry the conversation beyond the article . users must follow the guidelines under our commenting policy and are encouraged to use the moderation tools to help maintain civility and keep discussions on topic .

        "text":"<h> A Day in the Life of NYC 's Hottest iPhone Doctor <p> Then One\/WIRED <p> There 's a story behind every broken phone , and Michel Lavache has heard them all . Like the one where some guy 's girlfriend found sexy photos of a stranger on his Snapchat and tossed his phone out the car window , onto the Cross Bronx Expressway . That was bad . Or another time , when a man got fed up with his lady showing too much skin on Instagram so he threw hers out of a third-story window . It shattered the screen to bits . <p> Lavache is New York City 's iPhone doctor . He 's a modern-day traveling medicine man , but instead of curing bodily ills , he fixes something that 's arguably even more precious in our phone-obsessed world . He spends most of his free time running around the city with his fix-it kit , patching up iPhones that have seen better days . He is the Apple Genius bar gone mobile . <p> Most people 's stories , Lavache says , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run over by cars for far less lurid reasons . And toilets ? Those things are basically iPhone swimming pools . More often than not , the phones he sees have been knocked off tables or are the product of sheer clumsiness . The reason I met Lavache involved one too many Budweisers and what I 'd like to believe was an unreasonably hard bathroom floor . <p> The morning I meet Lavache , he 's sitting in a corner table at a cafe in midtown Manhattan , loosening the last of the tiny bolts on the frame of an iPhone 6 . He 's using a screwdriver that looks like a Barbie toy in his hands . \" I 've seen a lot worse , \" he says to me and Terrence , the phone 's owner . For the past month Terrence has been using a phone with a cracked screen , the result of -- he claims -- his wife knocking it off the bathroom counter while getting ready for work . \" She likes to use my phone , \" he explains . \" She has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shatter pattern ; it starts in the upper righthand corner and fissures down to the bottom of the phone , making his screen look like a melting chunk of Arctic ice . It looks bad , but Lavache assures us it 's a simple fix . There 's no smashed camera , ruined port , or broken LCD screen -- he estimates it 's maybe a four on a scale of one ( totally usable ) to 10 ( WTF happened ! ? ) . \" The top righthand corner is the worst spot for breaks , \" Lavache explains , adding that most of the time it 's a bent frame that pinches the glass and causes it to crack , not a direct blow to the glass itself . \" It 's probably 80 percent of the breaks I see . \" <p> It takes Lavache 10 minutes to perform the minor surgery : He removes 14 screws , gingerly disconnects the sensors and ribbon cables from the LCD panel , swaps in a new sheet of glass , and returns the screws to their holes using the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who considers the newly smooth piece of glass before thrusting the phone into the air like a trophy and exclaiming , \" It 's like a brand new phone ! \" He pays Lavache in cash -- $110 for the fix -- and heads back across the street to his office with his brand not-quite-new phone . <p> Michel Lavache . Laurent Chevalier <p> Early fall , right around when Apple announces its new phones , is Lavache 's busiest time of the year . People are anxious to get their old phones fixed so they can trade them in and make some money . \" Last year I had to use my vacation time to see people all day morning to evening , \" he says of the post-Apple event buzz . <p> Lavache charges $110 to fix an iPhone 6 screen , $85 for a iPhone 5S , $70 for a 5 , and $45 for a 4S . He says an iPhone 6 screen costs him around $75 from his supplier in New Jersey , who gets them from someone in China . That 's $35 in revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can be anywhere from $10 to $15 . Not bad for 20 minutes of work . He says he almost makes enough on the hustle to quit his job ( he works in IT at The New York Times ) and do this full time . but he does n't have any plans to do that . \" What if the next iPhone has sapphire glass ? \" he asks . \" Then what ? \" <p> At least for now , business is booming . That should n't surprise you : Think about how many of your friends are carrying $700 mini-computers with jacked up screens they intend to fix at some point . The rest of the technology world might change at a rapid-fire pace , but if there 's one thing you can count on , it 's that someone , somewhere just dropped a phone . And most of those people lack the combination of time , patience , and cash it takes to get it fixed at the Apple Store . This is bad news for Apple , but great news for enterprising tinkerers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid adoption of smartphones and customer 's willingness to break their warranty for the sake of convenience and price . <p> Lavache is far from the only guy doing this . Services like iCracked have raised major money from investors , and IBIS Market reports that cell phone repair is a $4 billion industry . Lavache says he has competitors in the city , but he 's hardly worried . \" There 's enough people breaking their phones that we can all be busy morning through night , \" he says . <p> Even on a slow day , Lavache will fix at least a half-dozen screens . Fridays are busiest , which is partly the result of Thursday night drinking ( alcohol is iPhone enemy number one ) , but also because people want their phone working for the weekend . \" People hate going on vacation with a broken phone , \" Lavache says . He keeps a meticulously-organized schedule of his appointments and divides his time into 15-minute blocks . He 'll allocate an extra 15 to 30 minutes to get from one location to next , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go . No office buildings ( check-in takes too long ) , no bars ( too dark ) , and no apartments ( people are weird ) . Instead , he has 10 locations around the city -- mostly coffee shops -- where he 'll meet clients . He can fix things other than screens , but screens is the big business . <p> Today he has nine appointments . After the meeting with Terrence we hop on the A train and head downtown to meet Juliette and her nanny . At a tourist-packed Starbucks across from One World Trade Center , Juliette , 14 , explains that there 's really no story to be told . She was just walking along , and her iPhone 6 slipped out of her hand . <p> Lavache has heard this a lot since the 6 and 6 Plus came out . \" The edges of the iPhone 6 are rounded off , \" he says . That , combined with the brushed stainless steel , makes your phone as slippery as wet bar of soap . The bigger size is even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm . \" You definitely could n't have a 6 Plus . \" <p> This is Lavache 's second time fixing Juliette 's phone , but she 's not particularly butterfingered . He has a lot of repeat customers ; people break their iPhones like clockwork . <p> \" Did I fix your phone on the way to the airport once ? \" he wonders aloud . \" Did you miss that flight , by the way ? \" He did , and she did . <p> Lavache fixes an iphone . Laurent Chevalier <p> Repairing a phone is a technical skill , and Lavache is well-equipped , what with his degree in electrical engineering and IT job . But running a successful repair business is about more than just knowing which screw goes where . His business thrives or dies on Yelp and personal referrals ( I found out about Lavache from a friend who also found out about him from a friend ) . He 's really in the customer service industry . <p> He currently has a five-star rating on Yelp that he 's pretty damn proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , he 's gotten 88 reviews , all five stars except for a one-star rating from Jon D. in 2014 that he probably wishes he could scrub off his page . These public ratings are important because to most people , Lavache is a total stranger . Letting a Genius Bar employee dissect your phone is one thing -- paying a man called the iPhone Doctor upward of $100 to do it requires a whole new level of trust . And the truth is , meeting him does feel a little illicit , as though you 're sneakily subverting the Apple gods . <p> But Lavache is easy-going and conversational . He does n't push people to talk , but is happy to listen if they do . Lavache might not realize it , but he 's constantly maintaining a delicate balance with his customers . He 's claiming responsibility for something that 's tied so closely to personal happiness , which means he 's often entangled in other people 's strange neuroses . He 's gotten teary 2 am calls from people freaking out about a broken screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have text messages and photos from loved ones who had recently died . Fixing iPhones is a little like speed dating ( or speed therapy ) . \" The best part of doing repairs sometimes is meeting 30 people a week in New York , \" he says . \" I just went to a birthday party of customer . We 're cool now because I fixed her phone . Several times . \" ",

You 'll want to seek out ones with shiny scales and bright eyes . If you press the flesh of the fish with your finger , it should bounce right back . The aroma of the fish should never be \" fishy \" - it should resemble clean , salty water . <p> When cooking silvers , they are medium in texture so they hold up well to poaching , saut ? ing or plank grilling . Silvers are lower in fat content and can benefit from a gentle cooking method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since this fish does have a lower fat content than others , be mindful that it does not dry out during the cooking process . <p> Chef Pat loves to embrace the fall season by accompanying the wild silver with chanterelle risotto and a corn succotash . <p> Heat grill to medium high . Clean and oil grill well . Coat salmon with oil and season with kosher salt and pepper . Place salmon on grill ( presentation side down ) until about 60 percent done or until you can see the fat coming out of the side of the filet . <p> Flip salmon and continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees . Remove from heat and top with citrus butter . Let sit covered until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees . <p> To serve , divide risotto into serving bowls and sprinkle Chanterelles around the perimeter .

        "text":"<h> Ask Congress <p> A forthcoming report by the congressional U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission provides new details of China 's space-weapons programs , dubbed counterspace arms , that are aimed at destroying or jamming U.S. satellites and limiting American combat operations around the world . <p> Two direct-ascent missiles capable of hitting satellites in both lower and higher orbits are under development , the SC-19 and the DN-2 . Anti-satellite missile tests were carried out as recently as last year . <p> The high-orbit DN-2 can hit U.S. Global Positioning Satellites but appears more suited for blowing up U.S. intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance satellites . The DN-2 could be deployed in five to 10 years . <p> \" These systems consist of a satellite armed with a weapon such as an explosive charge , fragmentation device , kinetic energy weapon , laser , radio frequency weapon , jammer or robotic arm , \" the report says . <p> The co-orbital arms maneuver in space close to satellite targets and then deploy weapons to disable or destroy them . They also can crash into satellites or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Chinese miniature imaging satellite passed within 28 miles of the International Space Station with no notification , in what the report said was a simulated co-orbital anti-satellite attack . <p> The commission report , to be publicly released next month , says China 's People 's Liberation Army believes demonstrating capabilities that can damage or destroy satellites is important to deterring adversaries , and that the anti-satellite threat is a more credible deterrent than nuclear arms . <p> \" The PLA assesses U.S. satellites are critical to the United States ' ability to sustain combat operations globally , \" the report says . \" PLA analysis of U.S. military operations states that ' destroying or capturing satellites and other sensors will deprive an opponent of initiative on the battlefield and make it difficult for them to bring their precision-guided weapons into full play . ' \" <p> The PLA estimates 50 U.S. surveillance satellites , along with drones and manned aircraft , provided 70 percent of battlefield communications in the 1990s operations in Kosovo . <p> China is also planning military cyberattacks that can take control of satellites by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military researchers have written that during a conflict , the PLA will \" attempt to conduct computer network attacks against U.S. satellites and ground-based facilities that interact with U.S. satellites , \" the report says . <p> \" If executed successfully , such attacks could significantly threaten U.S. information superiority , particularly if they are conducted against satellites with sensitive military and intelligence functions , \" the report says . \" For example , access to a satellite 's controls could allow an attacker to damage or destroy the satellite ; deny , degrade , or manipulate its transmissions ; or access its capabilities or the information , such as imagery , that can be gained through its sensors . \" <p> The report said Chinese hackers probably were behind several computer attacks against U.S. space assets , including a September 2014 hack of National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration satellite and weather service systems . <p> China also has acquired a number of electronic ground-based jammers for use against satellites , and in 2006 China fired a high-powered laser that temporarily disrupted a U.S. satellite , the report said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A nuclear detonation in low-earth orbit would create a damaging electromagnetic pulse that could disrupt unshielded satellites . <p> A copy of the draft report was obtained by Inside the Ring and is the latest publicly available draft . The final report will be released next month . <p> New Russian cruise missile operational <p> Russia conducted a flight test of it newest long-range cruise missile on Sept. 11 , a month before firing the missiles from the Caspian Sea into Syria as part of Moscow 's campaign in support of President Bashar Assad 's regime . <p> The Sept. 11 flight test of an SSN-30A missile , known by NATO as Kalibr , demonstrated capabilities similar to the U.S. Navy 's Tomahawk cruise missile .

We 're trying to see if we can get it done in 2016 , in one of those two . But if not , 2017 for sure . \" <p> After playing exhibition games in Berlin , Tokyo and even Goteborg , Sweden , for years , the league decided to focus on London about a decade ago with much success . <p> Sky Sports , the primary sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a regular basis in 2007 , and the country now gets as many as six live games a week . <p> Thirteen of the 14 International Series games at Wembley Stadium have sold out , and beginning in 2018 , the league will host two games a year at the Tottenham Hotspur soccer club 's new stadium . <p> The NFL this month extended its agreement to play at least two games a year at Wembley through 2020 ( with an option for five more years ) , and the league is planning a fourth international game next fall after growing to three games for the first time this year . <p> \" There 's always been a fan base here and a pretty dedicated fan base , but once we started getting the regular-season games in 2007 , I think that accelerated everything , \" said Neil Reynolds , a former public relations manager for the NFL in Europe and the current co-presenter of the league on Sky Sports . \" You see it across the board . Our TV numbers are up every year . Player-participation numbers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it all started once we started getting the real thing . \" <p> Waller said the NFL 's focus in London always has been with an eye toward creating \" enough of a fan demand to support a full season . \" <p> And while that may or may not involve eventually having a franchise overseas , the league has done its best to slowly ramp up and test the demand for its product . <p> In 2013 , the NFL played two regular-season games in London for the first time . Last year , the league moved the start time of one its London games -- the Lions ' 22-21 win over the Atlanta Falcons -- from an evening to an afternoon kickoff .

        "lower_text":"<p> london - barry sanders played his only football game in london 22 years ago , when the lions met the dallas cowboys in the american bowl at wembley stadium . <p> sanders did

        "text":"<h> Victoria Beckham : How Her Line of 10 Dresses Became a Fashion Empire <p> Victoria Beckham is a Woman of the Year because ... \" She 's bold enough to curate a style all her own . She 's a loyal , giving friend -- and funny , funny , funny ! \" -- actress Eva Longoria <p> Posh Perfectionist : \" I always wanted to work in fashion ; it was always my passion , \" says Beckham , 41 , photographed in the London office of the empire she created . Victoria Beckham dress . Manolo Blahnik pumps . <p> When I first met Victoria Beckham , two decades ago , the world had never heard of the Spice Girls . She and her bandmates stormed into my office at a U.K. TV network and gave a jaw-dropping rendition of \" Wannabe . \" Although not as bold as her Spice peers -- everyone else jumped up on the desks -- Victoria was the one who assured me they were going to make it . \" We 're not going to stop till it happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , a global phenomenon . And the world got to know Posh Spice , a camera-ready superstar who married an equally famous and sexy Brit , David Beckham ( they met after one of his soccer games ) . After the Spice Girls -- amicably -- went their separate ways , Beckham had a brief solo career but decided to devote most of her time to being a mom . Then in 2008 , after working with a sunglasses company and a denim brand ( and even modeling on a Milan runway ) , she made the bold decision to launch her own fashion line . <p> Just your average career change ? Hardly . The fashion world is not particularly kind to celebrities who decide they want to become designers . Beckham debuted her collection in the quietest , humblest way possible : in a small hotel room with intimate one-on-ones with the press , placing the emphasis on her clothes , not her celebrity . It was a smart , smart tactic . \" We have met with many celebrities who aspire to get into fashion , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy it takes , \" says Jim Gold , president and chief merchandising officer of the Neiman Marcus Group . \" Victoria was different . There are no shortcuts in this business , and she was willing to roll up her sleeves . \" Her hard work and meticulous design have turned that first collection of 10 dresses into a fashion empire worth a reported $57 million . The silhouettes of her collections are so classic and flattering that just about every celeb in Hollywood -- from Oprah to Jennifer Lawrence -- has a VB dress in her closet . The label has won the respect of industry insiders too : She 's been awarded multiple British Fashion Awards , including two for brand of the year . <p> Beckham 's gift is to make clothes that women want to wear . \" Women respond to her clothes because she lives a life that they understand , \" says friend and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour . \" She 's an incredibly busy woman , she 's the mother of four kids , she 's very much a partner to David , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women who are working , traveling , balancing , juggling all sorts of things at the same time . \" She tries to teach her children , sons Brooklyn , Romeo , and Cruz and daughter Harper , some of what she 's learned : \" Nothing ever came naturally to me , \" she says . \" I was never the cleverest , never best at anything . But we always tell our children that if you work hard and believe in yourself , you can do what you want . \" <p> And she 's showing them that when you 're successful , you give back -- period . In 2014 Beckham became an international goodwill ambassador for UNAIDS and since then she has raised more than $4 million to benefit HIV and AIDS charities including AMFAR , the Elton John AIDS Foundation , and Mothers 2 Mothers . \" Motherhood puts us all on one level , \" she says . \" I just felt this real pull to help . \" She does n't simply lend her name or write a check : She 's visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the disease . \" Victoria 's helping us to reach those millions of people out there we can not reach , \" says Michel Sidib ? , executive director of UNAIDS . \" She 's a person of compassion , and she 's opening new doors . \" <p> Fellow bandmate Melanie Brown ( a.k.a . Scary Spice ) is not surprised in the least by her friend 's successes . \" She 's broken the mold , \" she says . \" And she 's the funniest , naughtiest , dirtiest pal to sit next to at dinner . \" ( Admits Beckham : \" I like to ring the tequila bell . \" ) <p> Indeed , when I see Beckham these days , what strikes me is the newfound ease with which she juggles her many roles . But her mission , she says , has never really changed : \" I did have to find myself and my confidence . And I want to make other women feel like the best version of themselves . That 's the same message as the Spice Girls . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIVE BY : \" Work hard , stay focused , be appreciative , and really , really go for it . I was told I could n't do lots of things , so if I can do it , you can . \" ",

        "title":"Plight of the Funny Female\n",
        "text":"<p> A few years ago , Laura Mickes was teaching her regular undergraduate class on childhood psychological disorders at the University of California , San Diego . It was a weighty subject , so occasionally she would inject a sarcastic comment about her own upbringing to lighten the mood . When she collected her professor evaluations at the end of the year , she was startled by one comment in particular : <p> \" She 's not funny , \" the student wrote . <p> Mickes realized that university students did n't seem to welcome , or even notice , the wit of many of her female colleagues . She 's not the only one . A recent graphic made by Ben Schmidt , an assistant professor of history at Northeastern University , analyzed the words used to describe male and female professors across 14 million reviews on RateMyProfessor.com . In every single discipline , male professors were far more likely than female ones to be described as funny . <p> \" I thought , ' maybe I 'm not that funny , ' \" Mickes said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great time with my female friends . \" <p> Mickes 's story triggered the familiar shot\/chaser of recognition and unease in me . I come from the kind of family that deals with minor adversity by making relentless fun of the petty tyrants responsible . ( Major adversity , we smother in smoked meats . ) Given three adjectives to describe me , most of my female friends would list \" funny \" as one of them . But I maybe make a man laugh once every other month . <p> Men might say , \" I would love to have a girlfriend who would make me laugh . \" But for men , that 's a luxury , not a necessity . <p> On one hand , we live in the golden age of female comedy . Tina Fey , Lena Dunham , Mindy Kaling , Abbi Jacobson , Ilana Glazer , and their ilk certainly are n't the first women to have wildly popular TV shows based entirely around their own funniness . But they might be some of the first to do it with fearless jokes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first female comedian to headline Madison Square Garden . <p> Women , suffice it to say , are funny . On the other hand , happy hours during which one man holds forth to a gaggle of raptly amused female onlookers exist . Mickes 's year-end review exists . My deftly hilarious female friends exist , and many are eternally single . If men and women are clearly capable of being equally funny , why does humor by non-famous women so often go unappreciated ? <p> * * * <p> In 2012 , Mickes decided to see whether her student had a point . ( Or rather , \" I decided to redirect my anger into something productive , \" as she described it . ) <p> A common way scientists measure funniness is by making undergrads -- the typical guinea pigs for social-science research -- play a version of TheNew Yorker cartoon-caption contest . For her study , Mickes asked 32 students to write captions for 20 New Yorker cartoons . The men were \" pretty excited about the task , \" but the women were more reluctant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked horrified and said , ' Uh , but I 'm not funny , ' \" she recalled . <p> After the students finished writing their quips , a new set of participants rated the captions . They found the men 's punch-lines to be ever-so-slightly more clever -- about .11 points more on a five-point scale . <p> The difference was small , but still , Mickes was horrified by the results . \" I thought ' Forget it , I 'm never going to do research again , ' \" she said . <p> Past research on gender and New Yorker cartoons had been mixed . In a 2011 study in the journal Intelligence , male participants also penned more amusing captions than women did . But in a study the year before , the men 's and women 's one-liners were equally droll . <p> Mickes 's study revealed another interesting difference : Men wrote some of the best jokes , but they also used more profanity and sexual humor , and those jokes were n't rated very funny . If men were truly the funnier sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In a later experiment , Mickes gave both male and female participants a list of random words , such as \" beef jerky \" and \" water slide , \" and asked them to write paragraphs using the words . Without prompting , the men wrote funny paragraphs . The women 's paragraphs were more creative and better-written , but they were n't funny . However , a surprising thing happened when Mickes explicitly told the participants to try to be funny in their paragraphs : Both genders used humor , and in equal measure . <p> As in hockey , it appears , so in lols : You miss 100 percent of the shots you do n't take . The 2011 Intelligence study similarly found that men wrote more captions overall , both funny and lame . In other words , men make more attempts at humor , so they are successful more of the time . <p> \" Men are willing to take more risks in humor , and they also fail more miserably , \" Gil Greengross , an evolutionary psychologist with Aberystwyth University in Wales and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \" it 's worth it . If you fail and you 're not funny , you lost maybe a few minutes . But if the person laughs , the benefit can be huge . \" <p> Men make so many joke-attempts , in fact , they are assumed to be funnier -- even when they 're not .

More recently , she 's performed a one-woman show about agoraphobia and written several books , including a comedic novel , DC Trip , which came out this month . <p> She 's so talented , in fact , that I was a little nervous about emailing her to ask for an interview about her relationships .

It is the English : population 50 million-plus , all of them under the government of a multinational entity , the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . <p> Until recently , nobody worried much about the statelessness of the English . After all , they dominated not only the U.K. , but also for much of the past 300 years a vast global empire . The empire is gone , but its legacy of language and law and political systems endures from California to Calcutta . <p> Suddenly , though , the future of England has become a very live question .

Meanwhile , the U.K. as a whole faces a referendum on exiting the European Union that could trigger a different constitutional crisis if England votes narrowly in favor of leaving the EU , but is kept in Europe by Scottish , Irish , and Welsh votes . Such an outcome could prod the English to follow the Scots in rethinking the United Kingdom .

        "lower_text":"<p> a few years ago , laura mickes was teaching her regular undergraduate class on childhood psychological disorders at the university of california , san diego . it was a weighty subject , so occasionally she would inject a sarcastic comment about her own upbringing to lighten the mood . when she collected her professor evaluations at the end of the year , she was startled by one comment in particular : <p> \" she 's not funny , \" the student wrote . <p> mickes realized that university students did n't seem to welcome , or even notice , the wit of many of her female colleagues . she 's not the only one . a recent graphic made by ben schmidt , an assistant professor of history at northeastern university , analyzed the words used to describe male and female professors across 14 million reviews on ratemyprofessor.com . in every single discipline , male professors were far more likely than female ones to be described as funny . <p> \" i thought , ' maybe i 'm not that funny , ' \" mickes said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great time with my female friends . \" <p> mickes 's story triggered the familiar shot\/chaser of recognition and unease in me . i come from the kind of family that deals with minor adversity by making relentless fun of the petty tyrants responsible .

funny . she ascended the internet-comedy scene in 2008 , with a series of parody campaign-trail \" vlogs \" by sarah palin , whom benincasa impersonated in a beehive hairdo , rectangular glasses , and \" ooo-keeeys \" straight out of wasilla . more recently , she 's performed a one-woman show about agoraphobia and written several books , including a comedic novel , dc trip , which came out this month . <p> she 's so talented , in fact , that i was a little nervous about emailing her to ask for an interview about her relationships . i said if she wanted she could use \" pejorative pseudonyms \" for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" this made me think that i , too , am funny . which , given the scientific literature , made me worry that i will die alone . <p> benincasa said that when she was younger , in her teens and early 20s , she would soften her personality in order to please the men she was chasing romantically . she 'd tell fewer jokes and laugh more heartily at theirs . her friends would tell her that she acted differently around her boyfriends . <p> \" i tried to play-act at being a woman , \" she said . \" this false me was always pretty and always ready for anything , and fun , and carefree . and the real me had a lot of things to say . the ' me ' i created was not bold and outspoken . she was not very funny . \" <p> benincasa 's dating strategy changed after she became a comedian . \" i had to be myself or the audience would n't accept it , \" she says . her career now serves as a sort of man filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'd better like it . her current boyfriend , she notes , is also funny , and he loves her for her wisecracking . <p> still , it 's depressing that for many women who are n't professional comedians , the most valuable social currency is beauty -- or worse , \" being sweet . \" in his infamous vanity fair piece about why women are n't funny , christopher hitchens presents humor as an essential tool men can deploy to break a woman 's defenses : <p> if you can stimulate her to laughter ... well , then , you have at least caused her to loosen up and to change her expression . <p> women can also stimulate people to laughter -- not just for the purpose hitchens had in mind , but to make a new friend , or to make an old one feel better . to impress a boss or a boyfriend 's parents . to lean in , for cryin ' out loud . if funniness is an implement of power , women deserve access to it , too . <p> if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is encouraged at the expense of women 's -- is there anything we can do about it ? buss is skeptical that human desire can be molded ; that a stern psa or even a shift in social mores could encourage men to seek out women who are witty rather than pretty . entrenched beliefs that are ugly and pass ? -- like racism -- persist even when people disavow them . men 's desire to be the kings of relationship comedy , meanwhile , is n't even frowned upon . <p> hone , from the university of missouri , is more optimistic . if humankind decides that women 's natural zaniness should be set free , mankind should start to ask funnier women out for drinks . and women could stop dating men who do n't laugh at their jokes . <p> \" just because a trait has served an adaptive purpose does not mean we should accept it , \" she said . \" i like to think that there 's hope for all the funny , single ladies out there . \" <h> most popular <p> more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point between this christmas and new year 's day -- and each and every one of them will take roughly 100

little , a person poops . for many travelers , \" how little \" is the operative phrase : by one estimate , as many as 40 percent of people experience constipation while they 're away from home , due partially to their gut bacteria 's reaction to the change of setting . <p> \" any time you leave your general habitat , it 's throwing your gut microflora off balance , \" says brooke alpert , a new york-based registered dietician . sometimes , that begins before you reach your new destination : in some people , the very act of traveling from point a to point b can cause constipation . movement stimulates the gut , so sitting on a plane or in a car for long periods of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go while in the air or on the road can also make it more difficult once you finally sit down on

file ? <p> the angriest and most pessimistic people in america are n't the hipster protesters who flitted in and out of occupy wall street . they are n't the hashtavists of #blacklivesmatter . they are n't the remnants of the american labor movement or the savvy young dreamers who confront politicians with their american accents and un-american legal status . <p> the angriest and most pessimistic people in america are the people we used to call middle americans . middle-class and middle-aged ; not rich and not poor ; people who are irked when asked to press 1 for english , and who wonder how white male became an accusation rather than a description . <p> you can measure their pessimism in polls that ask about their expectations for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both counts , whites without a college degree express the bleakest view . you can see the effects of their despair in the new statistics describing horrifying rates of suicide and substance-abuse fatality among this same group , in middle age . <p> which is the largest nation in europe to lack a state of its own ? the catalans ? the walloons ? wrong and wrong . it is the english : population 50 million-plus , all of them under the government of a multinational entity , the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . <p> until recently , nobody worried much about the statelessness of the english . after all , they dominated not only the u.k. , but also for much of the past 300 years a vast global empire . the empire is gone , but its legacy of language and law and political systems endures from california to calcutta . <p> suddenly , though , the future of england has become a very live question . since the late 1990s , scotland has obtained more autonomy for itself . nearly 45 percent of scots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing nationalists are weighing a second try if reelected in 2016 . meanwhile , the u.k. as a whole faces a referendum on exiting the european union that could trigger a different constitutional crisis if england votes narrowly in favor of leaving the eu , but is kept in europe by scottish , irish , and welsh votes . such an outcome could prod the english to follow the scots in rethinking the united kingdom . it 's quite imaginable that sometime within the next u.s. presidential term , england could under one scenario or another part ways from scotland and emerge as a self-governing entity ( albeit with wales and a sliver of ireland still attached ) for the first time since shakespeare started his writing career . <p> republicans may have a lock on congress and the nation 's statehouses -- and could well win the presidency -- but the liberal era ushered in by barack obama is only just beginning . <p> over roughly the past 18 months , the

darren wilson , shot and killed an african american teenager , michael brown , in ferguson , missouri . for close to two weeks , protesters battled police clad in military gear . missouri 's governor said the city looked like a war zone . <p> in december , an african american man with a criminal record avenged garner 's and brown 's deaths by murdering two new york city police officers . at the officers ' funerals , hundreds of police turned their backs on new york 's liberal mayor , bill de blasio . <p> on the internet , search queries are used to target vulnerable consumers . <p> google knows the questions that people would n't dare ask aloud , and it silently offers reams of answers . but it is a mistake to think of a search engine as an oracle for anonymous queries . it is n't . not even close . <p> in some cases , the most intimate questions a person is asking -- about health worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that set off a chain reaction that can have troubling consequences both online and offline . <p> all this is because being online increasingly means being put into categories based on a socioeconomic portrait of you that 's built over time by advertisers and search engines collecting your data -- a portrait that data brokers buy and sell , but that you can not control or even see . ( not if you 're in the united states , anyway . ) <p> if a pulitzer-finalist 34-part series of investigative journalism can vanish from the web , anything can . <p> the web , as it appears at any one moment , is a phantasmagoria . it 's not a place in any reliable sense of the word . it is not a repository . it is not a library . it is a constantly changing patchwork of perpetual nowness . <p> digital information itself has all kinds of advantages . it can be read by machines , sorted and analyzed in massive quantities , and disseminated instantaneously . \" except when it goes , it really goes , \" said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archive . \" it 's gone gone . a piece of paper can burn and you can still kind of get something from it . with a hard drive or a url , when it 's gone , there is just zero recourse . \" <p> the islamic state is no mere collection of psychopaths . it is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs , among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse . here 's what that means for its strategy -- and for how to stop it . <p> what is the islamic state ? <p> where did it come from , and what are its intentions ? the simplicity of these questions can be deceiving , and few western leaders seem to know the answers . in december , the new york times published confidential comments by major general michael k. nagata , the special operations commander for the united states in the middle east , admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the islamic state 's appeal . \" we have not defeated the idea , \" he said . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past year , president obama has referred to the islamic state , variously , as \" not islamic \" and as al-qaeda 's \" jayvee team , \" statements that reflected confusion about the group , and may have contributed to significant strategic errors . <p> in his new book , a nobel laureate outlines how the huge disparity arose and the huge course correction needed to address it . <p> if there 's one thing joseph stiglitz wants to say about inequality , it 's that it has been a choice , not an unexpected , unfortunate economic outcome . that 's unnerving , but it also means that citizens and politicians have the opportunity to fix the problem before it gets worse . <p> a guide to the returning hits and new shows on network , cable , and streaming services <p> 2015 may have spawned the phrase \" peak tv \" thanks to an onslaught of shows in every format imaginable , but 2016 is n't going to offer much respite . in the coming months , terrestrial networks , premium cable , and streaming services will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorites , no matter how niche their audience . here 's a look at a fraction of what 's in store for the early months of 2016 . <p> sherlock : the abominable bridefriday on pbspremieres january 1 <p> as benedict cumberbatch and martin freeman have turned into major film stars , new episodes of steven moffat 's 21st-century sherlock have been harder and harder to come by . but two years after the show 's third-season finale , viewers will get a one-off special that will de-modernize the show , taking it back to victorian times with a ghost story -- something moffat says would n't work as well in the present day . the 90-minute episode will premiere on pbs on new year 's day . season four ? you 'll have to wait until 2017 . <p> with the arrival of cooler weather comes the resurgence , in catalogs and department stores , of that most dubious of offerings : the two-piece set of pajamas . <p> granted , not all pajamas are as hilariously improbable as the collared , button-down shirt , which makes the person wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dreamland . but even the more casual pjs , the kind that look like something you 'd wear to yoga or third-grade gym class , seem way too hot and constricting for sleep . <p> i have a theory that pajamas were invented for the scenes in tv shows where couples are sitting up in bed talking , but are actually worn by very few real people . to lay around and watch netflix ? sure . but personally , i 've never seen a man fall asleep while wearing pajamas .

        "title":"7 Types Of Marriage Betrayal That Are Often Overlooked\n",
        "text":"<h> 7 Types Of Marriage Betrayal That Are Often Overlooked <h> You may not even realize you 're guilty of these . <p> When people think of cheating in a relationship , physical infidelity is usually the first thing that comes to mind . But as marriage therapist Christine Wilke has seen firsthand , there are other less obvious ways spouses can break their marital bond . Many are just as damaging as affairs . <p> \" Affairs can lead to a hardcore exit for many , \" the Pennsylvania-based therapist said . \" But exits from a marriage can also occur when couples engage in subtle little diversions that enable them to avoid true intimacy with each other . \" <p> Below , Wilke and other relationship experts share seven ways you may be betraying your spouse without even realizing it . <p> 1 . You always put the kids first . <p> Who comes first in your life , your spouse or the kids ? While you should prioritize your kids ' needs , putting too much focus on them could cheat your spouse out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship coach who co-authored the book Passionate Spark , Lasting Love with his wife Susie . <p> \" You think focusing on your kids and other obligations will strengthen and make your relationship better but instead the exact opposite happens , \" said Collins . \" You and your spouse end up becoming strangers who pass each other in the hallway and passion and connection withers and dies . You may love each other but you 're not ' in love ' anymore largely because you 've neglected the relationship without even realizing it . \" <p> 2 . You emotionally cheat by confiding in someone else . <p> Your spouse should be your emotional confidante , the sounding board you turn to when you need to share just about anything . If you start emotionally opening up to someone else -- especially someone you 're attracted to -- you could be well on your way to having an emotional affair , said Los Angeles-based psychotherapist Foojan Zeine . ( It 's especially bad if you start sharing unflattering details about your relationship with this new person . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friendship , closeness and intimacy to another person , we feel cheated , \" she said . \" Your spouse should n't take the place of your best friends , but he or she needs to have the security and openness of being the person you turn to the most . To foster a close emotional relationship that goes over and above what you have with your partner feels like a betrayal . \" <p> 3 . You 're glued to your phone all day . <p> It does n't matter if you 're sifting through important work emails or texting your buddies about fantasy football picks , spending an excessive amount of time on your phone when you 're in the company of your spouse sends a clear message to him or her : I could be spending my downtime with you , but I 'd rather be on my phone . <p> \" Everyone needs downtime and these activities help us to decompress but they become troublesome when they are substitutes for meaningful interaction with your spouse , \" Wilke said . \" Ask yourself : Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse ? \" <p> 4 . You cheat on your spouse financially . <p> Those secret credit card purchases you 've been making behind your spouse 's back are bound to come to light eventually -- and when they do , it could spell major trouble . A 2011 study conducted by the National Endowment for Financial Education found that 68 percent of the time , financial infidelity had a negative impact on relationships , with 16 percent of marriages ending because of it . <p> \" When one mate withholds financial information , it breaks down the fundamental trust in their partnership , \" said Zeine . \" The partner who has to pay the consequence of the other 's financial actions usually feels cheated . Lack of transparency in this area leads to minimum trust . You no longer feel like part of a team . \" <p> 5 . You spend more time with your friends than with your spouse . <p> Having hobbies and interests outside of your marriage is important -- and being together 24\/7 is n't exactly healthy . But it 's a problem when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backseat to nearly everything else in your life , especially your friends . Otto Collins said he 's learned this firsthand . <p> \" Many years ago , when I was much younger and still married to my first wife , I went to 26 concerts in one year ( mostly without her ) while she was home taking care of our young son , \" he recalled . \" The marriage broke up for many reasons but the fact is that I put outside activities above the relationship , which did n't help . Putting close friends before your spouse creates distance and mistrust between the two of you , which could harm your relationship . \" <p> 6 . You rant about your spouse to others . <p> You may think venting to friends about your husband 's annoying grooming habits is harmless , but a small betrayal of trust occurs any time you say something to friends or family that derides your spouse , said relationship coach Susie Collins . <p> \" My husband and I have a rule in our relationship that we teach to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything when you 're not with your partner that you would n't say or do if they were standing right beside you , \" she said . \" Many people think it 's healthy to ' unload ' or just connect with friends by revealing their partner 's innermost secrets or sins but it always backfires .

        "text":"<h> The Impact Of New Hepatitis C Drugs On National Health Spending <p> Those who follow Altarum Institute 's monthly health sector briefs and trend reports are well aware that the five-year run of record low growth rates in national health spending ( from 2009 through 2013 ) has come to an end , or at least been interrupted . According to data just released by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , health spending grew by 5.3 percent in 2014 , compared to 2.9 percent in 2013 and roughly 4 percent from 2009 through 2012 . Our estimates for the first eight months of 2015 show growth of 6.2 percent , though on a downward path , indicating that the year could finish at around 6 percent growth . <p> Many analysts had predicted well in advance an increased health spending growth rate for 2014 due to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) . The expanded coverage provisions of the ACA were expected to increase the number of persons with health insurance and hence health spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump in prescription drug spending that occurred in 2014 was unforeseen . In 2013 , spending on prescription drugs grew by only 2.4 percent , but in 2014 , it skyrocketed to 12.2 percent . Some of this increase in spending on prescription drugs is due to expanded coverage , and some is due to the acceleration in prescription drug prices . <p> A major source of this growth was the introduction of Sovaldi in December 2013 , and Harvoni in October 2014 . Both are very expensive breakthrough drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C ( a disease of the liver , affecting approximately 3 million Americans ) . The new hepatitis C drugs have had a significant impact on growth rates in spending on prescription drugs and on national health spending . <h> Company Sales Of New Hepatitis C Drugs <p> I use company reports to track quarterly U.S. sales of the four bestselling new prescription drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C : Harvoni and Sovaldi ( Gilead Sciences , Inc . ) , Viekira Pak ( AbbVie ) , and Olysio ( Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical to the final sales captured in health spending , they provide a basic sense of the impact of hepatitis C drugs on overall health spending growth rates ( Note 2 ) . <p> The quarterly sales are shown in Figure 1 . Combined sales were $100 million in Q4 2013 , jumping to $2.4 billion and $3.8 billion in Q1 and Q2 2014 . In Q3 , sales of the existing drugs fell to $2.9 billion , presumably due to the expected release of a more appealing drug , Harvoni , in October . Starting in Q4 2014 , sales moved back to $3.5 billion and have stayed in that range during the first three quarters of 2015 . <h> Figure 1 : Quarterly Company Sales Of New Drugs To Treat Hepatitis C <h> Impact On 2014 Growth In Health Spending <p> National health spending in 2013 was about $2.9 trillion . In 2014 , company sales of the new hepatitis C drugs were $12.3 billion higher than in 2013 . This represents 0.4 percent of total health expenditures in 2013 , and suggests that the new hepatitis C drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate . In the absence of these new drugs , national health spending would have grown by about 4.9 percent rather than 5.3 percent . <p> Prescription drug spending in 2013 was $265 billion . Similar math suggests that the new hepatitis C drugs added about 4.6 percentage points to the growth in prescription drug spending in 2014 . The total growth rate in prescription drug spending in 2014 was 12.2 percent , so we estimate that it would have been 7.6 percent in the absence of the new hepatitis C drugs . That latter would still have been a large increase relative to the 2.6 percent growth seen in 2013 for prescription drugs and is likely due to a combination of expanded coverage and accelerated price growth . <h> Likely Impact On 2015 Growth In Health Spending <p> While spending on hepatitis C drugs in 2015 remains very high ( $14.4 billion is a reasonable estimate , assuming $3.5 billion in Q4 ) , it represents a much smaller increase ( $1.9 billion ) than experienced in 2014 ( $12.3 billion ) . This means that in 2015 , hepatitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the growth rate in national health expenditures and 0.6 percentage points to the growth rate in prescription drug spending . <p> To put it another way , the relatively small increase in hepatitis C spending in 2015 should reduce the overall rate of growth in national health expenditures by more than 0.3 percentage points compared to the growth rate in 2014 . For prescription drugs , it should bring the growth rate down by about 4 percentage points ( Note 3 ) . <p> Our November health sector spending brief shows that the growth rate in spending on prescription drugs has indeed been falling in 2015 and , as of September , was at 8.4 percent , year over year . This is 3.8 percentage points below the growth rate in 2014 , and we attribute much of the decline to the leveling off in spending on hepatitis C ( Note 4 ) . <p> The decline in the prescription drug spending growth rate in 2015 has been more than offset by a higher rate of growth in spending on health care services so that , in September , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the rate for 2014 . In the absence of the prescription drug spending slowdown , the September growth rate would have been about 5.9 percent . <h> Implications For 2016 And Beyond <p> I conclude with speculation about the future using rough estimates that I believe nonetheless provide some useful information . U.S. sales of hepatitis C drugs seem to have stabilized at about $14 billion per year , which equates to about 150,000 persons treated per year ( at a rate of $90,000 per person treated ) . <p> Of course , the amount we actually spend per year over the next few years could be higher or lower than what we spent in 2015 . Recent recommendations argue for treatment of nearly all diagnosed cases , yet many states and other payers continue to prioritize candidates for treatment based on severity of illness and other factors . This means that the near-term rate of spending is quite unpredictable and depends upon how much effort is put toward identifying and treating existing cases , how much resistance there is to approving treatment , and what competition might do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curative powers of these drugs should drive hepatitis C prevalence , and therefore spending , to very low levels . <h> Note 1 <h> Note 2 <p> One difference is the lag between when the sale ( to an intermediary ) is recorded by the company and when the final sale is made to the consumer . Another is that retail markups are included in health spending but not in company sales . Finally , prescription drug sales in the national health accounts refer only to retail sales , while company sales include sales to hospitals and physicians for drugs administered during the health encounter and whose costs are embedded in the hospital or physician bill . The vast majority of hepatitis C drugs are sold at retail . <h> Note 4 <p> The leveling off we observe in company sales in 2015 runs counter to a recent report stating that Medicare spending on these drugs grew by $4.5 billion in 2015 . Some of this may be due to lags between company sales to intermediaries and the subsequent sales to Medicare patients . We have not built lags into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2014 impact and understated the 2015 impact . <h> Comments <p> That seems like a reasonably accurate way of putting it . Using your language , the \" wound \" is bound to heal eventually because of the curative properties of the drug . As more and more patients are cured , there will be fewer patients with the disease and fewer new patients per year contracting the disease . Eventually , spending on these drugs should begin to drop toward zero ( the wound heals ) . But it could be many years before that happens . <p> You suggest that Hepatitis C drugs will have a less than .1% affect on national health expenditures , but would it be fair to say that this simply means the sizable impact on yearly health expenditures it created ( .4% to total expenditures and 4.6% to prescription drug expenditures ) is simply the new normal and any additional increases will be relatively muted ?

        "text":"<h> More <p> Convoys of cars honked their horns throughout the night . Dancers moved to salsa beats blearing out of speakers stacked in plazas under the moonlight . Celebrators draped themselves in Venezuelan flags and leapt up down , some with tears of happiness in their eyes . <p> The fervent celebrations broke out in many parts of Caracas and across Venezuela in the early hours of Monday morning after the biggest political defeat for the nation 's governing socialist alliance , once headed by the late Hugo Chavez , in 17 years . <p> In elections for Congress , the opposition Democratic Unity coalition had a landslide victory with a lead of more than 2 million votes , or about 18% , and looked set to have two-thirds of the lawmakers . The passion of the festivities illustrate how many here yearn for change in a country that suffers runaway inflation , shortages of basic goods , and endemic violent crime . <p> \" I am happy , happy , happy , that Venezuela has a new light , a new hope , \" says Soraya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag and dancing . \" I have faith in God , and in this wonderful people we have , who finally woke up . Things have passed that should never have happened in our country . \" <p> Another celebrator , Jaynor Hernandez , 24 , said he can hardly remember a time when the socialists , referred to here as the Chavistas , were not in power ; he was only seven when Chavez won his first election in 1998 . \" Things have been terrible . But we can do better , \" says Hernandez , a student . \" We can get out of this hole we are in now . We should n't have to stand in line for hours just to buy basic stuff . \" Hernandez drove round the streets in a car packed with fellow students , shouting in celebration and waving a flag out the window . <p> When Chavez first won power in 1998 , he inspired similarly passionate celebrations as he promised to uplift the poor majority in the hillside slums and sunburned villages of this oil rich nation . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to win election after election and survived an attempted coup against him in 2002 , after thousands took to the street in his support . When he railed against the \" imperialism \" of the United States and declared he was building \" twenty-first-century socialism , \" he widened his support to the left across the world , even among Hollywood stars . <p> But while Chavez became a superstar of the international left , his critics say he built an increasingly dysfunctional economic system at home . The government expropriated farms and factories only to see production at them dive . It fixed prices on some basic goods , but many companies stopped producing them . It fixed the exchange rate of the Venezuelan currency to the dollar , only to see its value collapse on the black market . When Chavez died in 2013 , his handpicked successor Nicolas Maduro took over just as oil prices dived , plunging the country into crisis . Since then , inflation has hit 84% , the worst in the world , and there have been shortages of goods from chicken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive class-based rhetoric , polarizing the nation , and clamped down on political opponents . A critical TV station lost its license to broadcast , police have violently shutdown protests and dozens of opposition leaders have been jailed in controversial trials . Amid the economic turmoil and confrontational politics , about a million Venezuelans have left the country in the last decade , many settling in Miami . <p> Following these political clampdowns , opposition figures said they were wary of electoral shenanigans before Sunday 's vote . However , early Monday morning , President Maduro recognized the opposition victory and promised to work with the new parliament , which will meet in January . Still , he also blamed mysterious dark forces of fomenting Venezuela 's economic crisis for political means . \" ( Saboteurs ) have hidden products from the people . They have put up prices , all for these elections , all to destabilize Venezuela , \" he said . <p> While Maduro 's term is due to end in 2019 , the opposition could seek a recall referendum next year to end his term early and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be able to fire cabinet members and has promised to pass an amnesty law to get political prisoners out of jail . \" Change has come , \" Democratic Unity leader Jesus Torrealba said to raucous cheers in the campaign HQ . \" All those of who have been unfairly persecuted , imprisoned or exiled , we promised to return their rights . \" <p> Still , it could take some years to fix Venezuela 's economic problems and bring the divided nation closer together . Even despite the crisis , millions voted for the socialist party , showing the deep support for the Chavistas in parts of the nation . Many fear losing welfare benefits if the opposition take power . \" The rich here never care about the poor . They do n't like the poor , \" says Mariana Navarro , 71 , who voted for the socialists in a working class Caracas district . \" With the rich in power , things would only get worse . \" ",

        "title":"Is the seriocomedy in danger of extinction?\n",
        "text":"<h> Movies : Past , present and future <h> Is the seriocomedy in danger of extinction ? <p> January 18 , 2011 5:42pm <p> Some may be inclined to read the soft results for \" The Dilemma , \" the Vince Vaughn-Kevin James movie that opened to $21 million over the holiday weekend , as evidence of the waning power of its stars , or perhaps the diminished appeal of the bromance . But there may be a more specific lesson in the struggles of the Ron Howard movie , which actually plays more serious than some of its ads imply . <p> The adult drama has been the subject of numerous obituaries in recent years , but looking at the success of movies like \" The Social Network \" and \" Black Swan , \" it 's doing just fine . What has n't fared so well is the seriocomedy , a story of real people with real problems that also contains its share of laughs -- the drama , essentially , that wears its seriousness lightly . <p> In the 1980s , this kind of film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain generation of American filmmaker : Lawrence Kasdan 's \" The Big Chill , \" James L. Brooks ' \" Broadcast News , \" Sydney Pollack 's \" Tootsie , \" John Hughes ' \" Planes , Trains &amp; Automobiles \" and so on . <p> These days ? Not so much . In the last six months , nearly every attempt at the seriocomedy has struggled , certainly with audiences and sometimes with critics . First came \" Cyrus , \" then \" The Switch , \" followed by \" It 's Kind of a Funny Story , \" \" Love and Other Drugs \" and now \" The Dilemma . \" <p> In 2009 , \" The 40-Year-Old Virgin \" director Judd Apatow faltered trying a seriocomedy with \" Funny People . \" Brooks , who practically pioneered the genre not only with \" Broadcast News \" but \" Terms of Endearment , \" struck out in 2010 with \" How Do You Know . \" If you were a studio executive , you could hardly be blamed if you read a good script for a seriocomedy and promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception seems to be \" The Kids Are All Right , \" a movie that came from well outside the studio system and proved reasonably successful last summer . ) <p> The seriocomedy has never been easy creative ground for directors . To make a good one you need to be proficient at constructing both laughs and drama , and have the dexterity to switch between them . From a business standpoint it 's even dicier : How , in this age of marketing , do you retail these tweeners ? <p> Movie-making these days seems to have calcified into genres . Dramas are intense and serious , like \" The Social Network , \" or weepie and inspirational , like \" The Blind Side \" or \" Secretariat . \" Comedies are broader and more gross-out , like the best of Adam Sandler or Apatow . <p> \" The problem is trailers , \" said James Schamus , the Focus Features chief who released \" The Kids Are All Right . \" \" These days with the Internet , it 's more important than ever , and it 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go for the laugh you never get the full laugh because the humor is situational , and you ca n't play the drama because then you kill the comedy vibe . \" <p> All of these issues are significant . But when the seriocomedy works , it usually works exceptionally well . Some of the best dramas and comedies of today would have trouble matching the quiet ambition of the best seriocomeides of 25 or 30 years ago . Even as one more bites the dust , it 's worth remembering how much promise the genre has , and how much it 's worth making the good ones no matter the marketing challenges . <p> Problem is in the trailer ? Then let 's forget about the script ... which is golden in THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT ; and then the director ... another big thing with this movie , and the casting . Hit it out of the ball park with this group . <p> I know in this digital age how important the marketing is ... but for God 's sake ... if the script is that good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the RIGHT director who knows exactly what to do and the RIGHT cast ... who are willing to be malleable enough in the right director 's hands . <p> And then it 's taking chances . <p> You 're not willing to do any of that ? Get out of the business ... and quit blaming it on the audience and a cool looking gizmo called a trailer ... and let the rest of us do it the right way . On the trailer ? Geez Schamus . <p> I do n't think we can blame the genre at all . Most have just been very subpar movies . It 's as simple as that . The romcoms have hit a really rough patch , should we get rid of those as well ? Well , okay , maybe . <p> I think the problem started with these tepid and insipid projects being greenlighted in the first place , and these are some big pedigrees behind them , so they should know better . For the movies that had better reviews , well , they were n't really mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been a step up from mumblecore anyway . <p> Most of the recent seriocomedy efforts were nothing more than sitcom episodes - we 've already seen ' The Dilemma , ' and ' The Switch , ' and the upcoming ' Hall Pass , ' and ' No Strings Attached ' on Seinfeld , Friends , etc . <p> And that 's the problem - audiences are inundated with seriocomedies 24\/7 . After all , most sitcoms are , in fact , formula seriocomedies - very few are straight comedies , like \" It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia . ' Who wants to pay $10-12 to see what 's basically a big screen rerun ? <p> Which points to another problem - we now have at least two generations of writers who 've grown up in the suburbs watching 8+ hours of TV per day . So , instead of writing ' what they know ' from a life well lived , they 're writing ' what they 've seen ' from a life of comfort and ease . Expecting anything but the same-old same-old from them is delusional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of enthusiasm about most of the films mentioned . Critically , most of them have been met with scorn but aside from that , the ones that were n't , like Cyrus and It 's Kind of a Funny Story , did n't appeal to a mass audience . <p> Take a film like 500 Days of Summer , a very atypical rom-com . There 's proof in its success that its genre is not dead ; it 's just that people do not want to be sold on just anything . It requires a taut script , something imaginative but also something engrossing to see these films meet with any degree of success . <p> That said , audiences can still be fickle and there are plenty of great films that fall by the wayside for a number of varying reasons . <p> I think if there more quality films released in these particular genres , audiences would n't be quite so wary to pursue them . As it stands , even some of the better films become a harder sell because of it . <p> my problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death knell for a comedy . and then when i read the negative reviews that it wasnt even a comedy but a drama with sprinklings of comedy , it made me think it couldnt do the comedy right so was trying to relabel itself as that . <p> Yeah , I 'm not so sure about the thesis here . Most of the movies you mention ( How Do You Know ? , Love and Other Drugs ) got poor-to-middling reviews from critics , so we ca n't exactly blame trailers on that . And your examples of past \" seriocomedies \" are questionable as well--Planes , Trains , and Automobiles ? Really ? That 's a flat-out comedy that happens to have a heart to it , not a drama that happens to be kind of funny . <p> But , then , lets look at recent movies , as well . Aside from The Kids Are All Right , we 've seen a number of quite funny dramas that recieved some either box office or critical love over the last years . The King 's Speech this year is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see the comedy in the Social Network that 's unfortunate . Eat , Pray , Love and Life as We Know It did n't bomb at the box office , even if critics were tepid , and looking back a stretch , how about Julie &amp; Julia , Adventureland , Rachel Getting Married , Sideways , Almost Famous , The Informant ! , or pretty much anything by Jason Reitman ( Juno , Thank You for Smoking , Up in the Air ) , Noah Baumbach ( Margot at the Wedding , Greenberg , The Squid and the Whale ) , or Wes Anderson ( The Royal Tenenbaums , the Life Aquatic , etc . ) ? Not to mention half the work by the Cohens or Danny Boyle . <p> I think the \" seriocomedy \" is doing just fine , both critically and commercially . A couple of disappointments by major talent ( I 'd love to see another great movie from Brooks , but did *anyone* think How Do You Know was it ? ) do n't make for a trend . <p> The Hollywood execs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring them in the face . Let 's see , all these typical seriocomedies made within the Hollywood system , with the same old parts , fail . Yet , the one that 's an independent movie succeeds . Why do n't they step down from their self-made golden thrones and say , \" I have seen the enemy , and it is us . \" <p> Stephen Eldridge nailed it with his comment above . I do n't see how an entertainment journalist could completely overlook Jason Reitman 's Up In The Air when discussing the downfall of the \" seriocomedy . \" That was one of the most talked about films of 2009 and most definitely a critical and commercial success . When somebody makes a good seriocomedy , it will have some level of success . <p> Surely the key is a good plot . An average plot can be ignored when drowned in humour and an average plot can be forgiven when dominated by strong characters . But surely the most enjoyable \" seriocomedy \" ( &lt;--wtf ? ) is one that has an intriguing plot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the problem with alot of these recent fails is because the stories are unoriginal and uninspiring and pose few questions for the viewer to truly ponder . <p> Used to be you needed a big star to open a movie . Now you need ' em to get a script thru the system . Joined way to early to a project , it leads to \" Meet the Fockers \" ... Big name stars walking thru the set , all for the long awaited paycheck . No motivation or creative spark is seen on set , and it shows . Babs , Bobby , even Jack , have just been selling out for the buck- do n't think the $20 per seat crowd does not feel the slight . Seeing big names drift thru a retreaded episode of Married w\/ Children will lead to stunted grosses , and no second viewings . The blockbusters were that because of multiple viewings by diehard fans . Good luck to Suits that follow formulas and do what their flacks push for . Take the box , ignore it , and then do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental impact of miles of film made , shot , developed , and then seen by only a few ... Be Green , film a GOOD scene ! Dramedy works only when the actors do ... like Bogey and Bacall , God love ' em ! <p> Seriocomedy works if you can take it as that . Some people just think right away it 's a comedy , then they go into it expecting a comedy , when they get that as well as some hard-hitting drama . However , it is hard to advertise seriocomedies as opposed just strictly comedies , or dramas . But it is not extinct , it just needs some more reviving . <p> Many of the seriocomedies have been rather bland and mediocre . It could just be that audiences had better things to watch as opposed to a bland comedy-drama . Most of the movies were either a ) very mild in both the comedy and drama aspects , b ) looked to be rather formulaic and c ) if tried too hard to be \" edgy \" and \" risque \" without trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the quality of the films as opposed to the genre itself .

        "lower_text":"<h> movies : past , present and future <h> is the seriocomedy in danger of extinction ? <p> january 18 , 2011 5:42pm <p> some may be inclined to read the soft results for \" the dilemma , \" the vince vaughn-kevin james movie that opened to $21 million over the holiday weekend , as evidence of the waning power of its stars , or perhaps the diminished appeal of the bromance . but there may be a more specific lesson in the struggles of the ron howard movie , which actually plays more serious than some of its ads imply . <p> the adult drama has been the subject of numerous obituaries in recent years , but looking at the success of movies like \" the social network \" and \" black swan , \" it 's doing just fine . what has n't fared so well is the seriocomedy , a story of real people with real problems that also contains its share of laughs -- the drama , essentially , that wears its seriousness lightly . <p> in the 1980s , this kind of film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain generation of american filmmaker : lawrence kasdan 's \" the big chill , \" james l. brooks ' \" broadcast news , \" sydney pollack 's \" tootsie , \" john hughes ' \" planes , trains &amp; automobiles \" and so on . <p> these days ? not so much . in the last six months , nearly every attempt at the seriocomedy has struggled , certainly with audiences and sometimes with critics . first came \" cyrus , \" then \" the switch , \" followed by \" it 's kind of a funny story , \" \" love and other drugs \" and now \" the dilemma . \" <p> in 2009 , \" the 40-year-old virgin \" director judd apatow faltered trying a seriocomedy with \" funny people . \" brooks , who practically pioneered the genre not only with \" broadcast news \" but \" terms of endearment , \" struck out in 2010 with \" how do you know . \" if you were a studio executive , you could hardly be blamed if you read a good script for a seriocomedy and promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception seems to be \" the kids are all right , \" a movie that came from well outside the studio system and proved reasonably successful last summer . ) <p> the seriocomedy has never been easy creative ground for directors . to make a good one you need to be proficient at constructing both laughs and drama , and have the dexterity to switch between them . from a business standpoint it 's even dicier : how , in this age of marketing , do you retail these tweeners ? <p> movie-making these days seems to have calcified into genres . dramas are intense and serious , like \" the social network , \" or weepie and inspirational , like \" the blind side \" or \" secretariat . \" comedies are broader and more gross-out , like the best of adam sandler or apatow . <p> \" the problem is trailers , \" said james schamus , the focus features chief who released \" the kids are all right . \" \" these days with the internet , it 's more important than ever , and it 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go for the laugh you never get the full laugh because the humor is situational , and you ca n't play the drama because then you kill the comedy vibe . \" <p> all of these issues are significant . but when the seriocomedy works , it usually works exceptionally well . some of the best dramas and comedies of today would have trouble matching the quiet ambition of the best seriocomeides of 25 or 30 years ago . even as one more bites the dust , it 's worth remembering how much promise the genre has , and how much it 's worth making the good ones no matter the marketing challenges . <p> problem is in the trailer ? then let 's forget about the script ... which is golden in the kids are alright ; and then the director ... another big thing with this movie , and the casting . hit it out of the ball park with this group . <p> i know in this digital age how important the marketing is ... but for god 's sake ... if the script is that good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the right director who knows exactly what to do and the right cast ... who are willing to be malleable enough in the right director 's hands . <p> and then it 's taking chances . <p> you 're not willing to do any of that ? get out of the business ... and quit blaming it on the audience and a cool looking gizmo called a trailer ... and let the rest of us do it the right way . on the trailer ? geez schamus . <p> i do n't think we can blame the genre at all . most have just been very subpar movies . it 's as simple as that . the romcoms have hit a really rough patch , should we get rid of those as well ? well , okay , maybe . <p> i think the problem started with these tepid and insipid projects being greenlighted in the first place , and these are some big pedigrees behind them , so they should know better . for the movies that had better reviews , well , they were n't really mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been a step up from mumblecore anyway . <p> most of the recent seriocomedy efforts were nothing more than sitcom episodes - we 've already seen ' the dilemma , ' and ' the switch , ' and the upcoming ' hall pass , ' and ' no strings attached ' on seinfeld , friends , etc . <p> and that 's the problem - audiences are inundated with seriocomedies 24\/7 . after all , most sitcoms are , in fact , formula seriocomedies - very few are straight comedies , like \" it 's always sunny in philadelphia . ' who wants to pay $10-12 to see what 's basically a big screen rerun ? <p> which points to another problem - we now have at least two generations of writers who 've grown up in the suburbs watching 8+ hours of tv per day . so , instead of writing ' what they know ' from a life well lived , they 're writing ' what they 've seen ' from a life of comfort and ease . expecting anything but the same-old same-old from them is delusional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of enthusiasm about most of the films mentioned . critically , most of them have been met with scorn but aside from that , the ones that were n't , like cyrus and it 's kind of a funny story , did n't appeal to a mass audience . <p> take a film like 500 days of summer , a very atypical rom-com . there 's proof in its success that its genre is not dead ; it 's just that people do not want to be sold on just anything . it requires a taut script , something imaginative but also something engrossing to see these films meet with any degree of success . <p> that said , audiences can still be fickle and there are plenty of great films that fall by the wayside for a number of varying reasons . <p> i think if there more quality films released in these particular genres , audiences would n't be quite so wary to pursue them . as it stands , even some of the better films become a harder sell because of it . <p> my problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death knell for a comedy . and then when i read the negative reviews that it wasnt even a comedy but a drama with sprinklings of comedy , it made me think it couldnt do the comedy right so was trying to relabel itself as that . <p> yeah , i 'm not so sure about the thesis here . most of the movies you mention ( how do you know ?

' <p> January 18 , 2011By Andy Grimm , Tribune Reporter <p> After his son 's body was found in the driveway of his Dolton home in November , Wale Awomolo pleaded with his neighbors to help catch the killers . <p> The man charged this week in the slaying , it turns out , lived two blocks away . Prosecutors say Nelon Drake , 22 , himself gave investigators the tip that led to his being charged Monday in the murder of 21-year-old graduate student Olubusayo Awomolo . <p> \" It is like a nightmare , like I 'm dreaming . Can this be true ? \" Wale Awomolo said . \" My own neighbor will kill my son ? I 'm just sick of life , honestly . Where can I live that I feel safe ? \" <p> Drake was charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery in the Nov. 29 killing , which allegedly began with a robbery attempt , Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Dolton Police Department statement , six others , including two Dolton residents , were charged with taking part in the robbery or concealing the killing . Dolton police did not return calls for comment . <p> Drake offered information on the killing -- without implicating himself as the shooter -- to investigators after he was charged in connection with a Jan. 12 armed robbery , Daly said . <p> Wale Awomolo said he and his family had all but given up hope of finding the killer when no witnesses stepped forward , even after a $2,000 reward for tips was announced . Awomolo said neighbors told him they had seen a group of young men approach Olubusayo and a scuffle break out . One witness said she heard gunshots and ran into her house . <p> \" But she did n't even call the police , \" Wale Awomolo said . <p> Police arrived only after Olubusayo 's older brother returned home that evening . In the darkness , he assumed a drunk had passed out in the driveway . <p> Olubusayo 's mother was visiting from Kenya when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just days before the family learned a suspect had been arrested , Wale Awomolo said . <p> It was not the community response Wale Awomolo expected after he worked to bring his six children to the U.S. from his native Nigeria and its depressed economy and political instability . <p> Since he arrived in Chicago in the 1970s , Awomolo has circled the city and suburbs in a cab to support his children , working 12-hour shifts and still finding time to earn an MBA . Two of Olubusayo 's older siblings are in medical school , two are engineers , and another is an accountant , Wale said . <p> When Wale Awomolo 's cab was broken into a few years ago , he decided his family would be safer in the suburbs , so he moved to a bungalow in Dolton . Olubusayo made few friends in the neighborhood , his father said . <p> \" He was all the time with his studies . He was at school and on his computer , \" his father said . Olubusayo was only a few months away from a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Despite Olubusayo 's long hours at school and Wale Awomolo 's longer hours in his cab , the father said he saw his son every morning and could not sleep at night until he saw his son was home .

        "text":"<h> Indigestion : Natural Remedies for Relief <p> Indigestion is n't an especially glamorous medical topic , but relieving this condition -- and keeping the whole gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract operating comfortably and efficiently -- is vital to overall well being . As French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau put it , \" Happiness : a good bank account , a good cook and a good digestion . \" <p> Unfortunately , too many Americans are taking a dubious shortcut to digestive health : GI medication use has jumped dramatically in recent years . One in ten Americans was prescribed at least one GI medication on an outpatient basis in 2007 ( the most recent year for which figures are available ) compared to 1 in 15 in 1997 . Such medications often do more harm than good -- masking imbalances that can lead to more serious conditions , and causing numerous side effects , including lower B12 levels , increased risk of fractures and even increased risk of infections . <p> Nearly everyone has an occasional bout of indigestion . Discomfort or burning in the upper abdomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually goes away without treatment . If you avoid foods that trigger your symptoms and unlearn unhealthy habits , such as eating too much or too quickly . The following self-help tips will both relieve and prevent indigestion : <p> Do n't eat too quickly . <p> Eat smaller meals . <p> Avoid late-night eating . <p> Try to relax after meals . <p> Avoid spicy foods if they contribute to your indigestion . <p> Do n't smoke . <p> Avoid or minimize intake of coffee and alcoholic beverages . <p> Keep a food diary to help identify items that trigger indigestion . <p> If these prove insufficient , spend more time considering the cause of your problem . Your digestive system mirrors your state of mind , which is why so many digestive disorders are stress-related . Pay attention to your emotions as well as your eating habits . Once you figure out exactly what 's triggering your pain , you 'll need to make lifestyle changes that may include relaxation exercises , yoga or meditation . Here are some other remedies you can try : <p> Drink peppermint tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . ( However , it may worsen esophageal reflux by relaxing the sphincter where the esophagus joins the stomach . Chamomile tea is an alternative . ) <p> Probiotics are products containing the helpful bacteria ( usually Lactobacilli or Bifidobacteria ) that normally inhabit the human digestive tract . Most of these \" friendly \" bacteria occur naturally in cultured milk products , such as yogurt with active cultures or acidophilus milk . Look for brands containing Bacillus coagulans ( BC-30 ) or Lactobacillus GG in liquid or capsule form . The usual dose is based on number of colony forming units , or CFU , and is typically in the range of 10-20 billion CFU . Probiotics are also an effective treatment for viral and antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children , inflammatory bowel disease , lactose intolerance , irritable bowel syndrome , vaginal yeast infections , food allergies , eczema and recurrent C. difficile infection . <p> Experiment with plant-derived digestive enzymes that can help you process foods . <p> Artichoke-leaf extract may help with indigestion by increasing bile flow needed to digest fats . Choose products that are standardized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deglycyrrhizinated licorice ( DGL ) is licorice devoid of glycyrrhizin , a compound that can raise blood pressure . It protects the lining of the stomach and esophagus from irritation by acid and is much safer than acid-suppressive drugs . Take two tablets chewed slowly 15 minutes before meals and at bedtime , or take one-half teaspoon of DGL powder at those times . Allow the extract to dissolve in the mouth and slowly trickle down the throat . You can take DGL as long as you have symptoms . <p> Finally , be aware that the common lower GI disorder known as \" irritable bowel syndrome \" or IBS is now being portrayed in pharmaceutical company advertisements as a disease requiring drug treatment . \" What for many people is a mild functional disorder -- requiring little more than reassurance about its benign natural course -- is currently being reframed as a serious disease attracting a label and a drug , with all the associated harms and costs , \" concluded an article by Australian researchers titled , \" Selling sickness : the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering , \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Medical Journal . <p> IBS often resolves with lifestyle changes and mind\/body interventions , but it is a real condition . If the diarrhea , stomach pain or other symptoms become chronic - meaning that they have persisted for more than four weeks , or if they have become steadily worse in character - consult with your primary health care provider .

        "text":"<h> Why Women Walk Out More Than Men <p> I had been following the on-again , off-again , on-again divorce of Sean Penn and Robin Wright for a while , not because I 'm celeb crazed but because before Penn took off for Haiti and Wright to L.A. , they lived just a few miles from me . I sometimes would see Wright around town , looking like any other San Francisco Bay Area yummy mommy shopping at Whole Foods or checking out the guitars at the local music shop , just much more famous and a heck of a lot richer . <p> So when I read Penn 's complaint to the Hollywood Reporter a few weeks ago that he 'd been \" taken for one half of everything I had in the divorce , \" I had to laugh -- \" Well , what did you expect , if you carry on like that ? \" -- and I had a flashback to my own divorce a few years prior . <p> Like Wright , there were affairs and other shenanigans . Like Wright , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one who finally said , \" I want a divorce \" -- the hardest words I ever had to say . And , like Penn , my then-husband was dumbfounded -- \" You 're leaving me ? \" <p> Yes , I was , and that 's because he was doing everything that looked like leaving me except the actual leaving part . <p> Men , evidently , do n't leave . <p> As it turns out , it 's -- sadly -- the only thing Wright and I do share , but it 's something we have in common with a lot of other marital splits . Women ask for divorce two-thirds more often than men . But it is n't so much because the wives woke up one day and \" fell out of love \" or realized they had \" different values or lifestyles , \" as many 50-something men who initiated divorce told AARP in a survey a few years back . <p> No , something else is clearly happening . It may be true that men do n't leave but you have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisely said , \" The truth is more important than the facts . \" <p> So what is going on ? <p> According to the National Marriage Project , formerly at Rutgers University , now at the University of Virginia , a lot : <p> \" Two-thirds of all divorces are initiated by women . One recent study found that many of the reasons for this have to do with the nature of our divorce laws . For example , in most states women have a good chance of receiving custody of their children . Because women more strongly want to keep their children with them , in states where there is a presumption of shared custody with the husband the percentage of women who initiate divorces is much lower . Also , the higher rate of women initiators is probably due to the fact that men are more likely to be \" badly behaved . \" Husbands , for example , are more likely than wives to have problems with drinking , drug abuse , and infidelity . \" <p> Last year proved to be a bumper crop of \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elin Nordegren , and Eva Longoria . But if the gals did n't file for divorce , would Jesse , Tiger , or Tony have dumped them and perhaps shacked up with the other woman -- or , in some cases , women ? Probably not . <p> A few authors who 've paid attention to those sorts of things cite some rather pathetic statistics that \" the other woman \" should pay attention to : about 3 percent of cheating men marry their lovers , according to Jan Halper ( Quiet Desperation : The Truth About Successful Men ) and about 75 percent of those marriages end up in divorce , according to Frank Pitman ( Private Lies : Infidelity and the Betrayal of Intimacy ) . <p> So , is it a case of guys having their cake and eating it , too ? I do n't know , but there does seem to be some sort of disconnect between actions and reactions . <p> Of course , affairs are n't the only reason women file for divorce more than men . And Penn certainly is n't the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to work \" ; men lose a lot in divorce , not just money and houses , but often access to their kids . That 's not OK , either . <p> Still , you 'd think that sober reality alone would be enough to shape up all that \" bad \" behavior . Instead , what it 's probably doing is keeping a lot of young men from wanting to get married in the first place ; with about half of marriages ending in divorce , saying \" I do \" is a big financial gamble for them . <p> And , sure , there are many , many \" badly behaved \" women out there . But at least if they cheat , most of them -- 55 percent , according to Susan Shapiro Barash ( A Passion for More : Wives Reveal the Affairs That Make or Break Their Marriages ) -- have the decency to leave .

And there are other wind projects around the city . <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : Austin , Texas leads the large city list , while Chicago , Illinois is third . Both cities have made big efforts to reduce a problem called urban heat islands . An urban heat island is a city area that is warmer than its surrounding rural area . This is caused by several things , such as dark colored roofs which absorb heat from the sun during the daytime , and release that heat at night . Air conditioners cooling the inside of buildings add to the increased temperatures by generating hot air outdoors . <p> Austin has launched an Urban Heat Island Mitigation Project to improve the situation . The city is planting more trees . And it is rewarding businesses and individuals who have reflective roofs . This kind of surface absorbs less heat . <p> STEVE EMBER : Chicago has long been interested in green roofs . In two thousand , city officials decided to replace the black tar roof on the city government building with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , improve air quality and control the amount of rainwater entering the city 's waste system . Green roofs also help reduce urban heat islands . <p> During hot weather , the building 's tar roof could reach temperatures of up to seventy-six degrees Celsius . <p> With the garden , the temperature of the roof area was reduced by at least thirty degrees Celsius . Chicago has since created over three hundred thousand square meters of green roofs . <p> SHIRLEY GRIFFITH : Washington , D.C. is also a leading city for green roofs , with over ninety two thousand square meters of green rooftops . The city also launched a program called \" Skip the Bag , Save the River . \" Stores charge people a five cent tax for using plastic or paper shopping bags instead of reusable bags .

Board members said they hope to begin that process within the next two months . <p> \" That is a key first step we need to accomplish before anything else can happen ; before we can move forward with architectural and site plans , \" said board member Ezra Callahan . \" That is going to require fundraising . We are moving ahead , but to continue that momentum , we need financial support . \" <p> The group has more than $50,000 , including a grant of $10,000 from the Community Foundation of the Lowcountry , with a promise of $27,000 more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if matched . <p> Cost to develop the first phase of the park on town-owned land is estimated at $4.5 million .

        "text":"<h> TV Tonight : Traffic Light <p> In Showtime 's comedy Episodes , a pair of British sitcom producers have lunch with Matt LeBlanc , who 's considering starring in a remake of their comedy about a headmaster at a boys ' school . LeBlanc notes that it sounds like The History Boys , and the more the couple try to explain the differences , the more it does in fact sound like that play . \" So , \" LeBlanc says : \" it 's History Boys meets you saying it 's not History Boys . \" <p> Traffic Light , a new sitcom debuting tonight on Fox , is Perfect Couples and Better With You meets Fox saying it 's not Perfect Couples or Better With You . But in this case that 's not entirely bad . <p> The more you get into the details , the more similar it sounds , to those shows -- which themselves are essentially the Modern Family formula applied to relationships -- and to the philosophy of almost every recent network sitcom about couples . There are three couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of development . Mike ( David Denman of The Office ) and Lisa ( Liza Lapira ) are married with a young son . Adam ( Nelson Franklin ) and Callie ( Aya Cash ) have just moved in together , a leap in commitment that is causing Adam no little stress . And Ethan ( Kris Marshall ) is a horndog bachelor who goes from relationship to intense , short-lived relationship . <p> Why Traffic Light ? Each of the guys , see , is at a different \" light \" in his life . Ethan has the green light , because he 's single . ( Lest you miss the metaphor , he drives an ambulance . ) Adam is slowing down at a yellow , i.e. , a marriage-like commitment . And Mike , of course , is at red . Because he 's been stopped . By a girl . <p> On paper , it sounds like another sitcom dedicated to the tired idea that relationships are forced on men like collars on dogs , the leashes held by annoying , fun-killing women . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am describing it . Partly that 's because the show , over the course of the episodes , reveals that it does n't really sign on to this high-concept premise : each of the relationships has stress and conflicts -- or else there would be no show . But it quickly becomes apparent that these men ( Mike and Adam , anyway ) really like being paired up , that their significant others are partners and interesting people in their own right , and that , like men in real life , they 're in relationships because they want to be . <p> Maybe more important , Traffic Light gets the relationships among its different subunits better than Perfect Couples . One of my issues with that NBC sitcom is that -- family connections aside -- the characters seem so annoying , to each other and the audience , that it 's not clear why they would want to spend this much time with each other in the first place . Traffic Light does n't push its characters to extremes ( Ethan being the possible exception , and the weakest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters actually like one another . And the show has a loose , dry humor that Franklin , in particular , pulls off well . <p> The show hardly seems like the rethinking of its form that Modern Family was for family sitcoms . For instance , there are way too many gags involving conferenced-in cellphone conversations in cars , which is quick becoming TV 's biggest clich ? . But after the four episodes I 've seen , Traffic Light is Perfect Couples and Better With You meets Perfect Couples and Better With You being funnier . That 's a start . ",

        "text":"<h> Gadgets for the ghosthunter <p> In a survey conducted by CBS News in 2005 , it was found that 48 percent of Americans believed in ghosts . Other surveys have put the number at anywhere from around 20 to over 50 percent . While such figures certainly do n't imply that ghosts are real , they do suggest that belief in them is relatively common . When someone does suspect that a ghost is present in their home or business , they will sometimes call in \" experts \" to ascertain if that is , in fact , the case ... and what sort of gear do these ghost hunters use to detect said spirits ? We decided to find out . <p> Given that ghosts are frequently thought of as non-physical beings that can only be seen by people like Jennifer Love Hewitt or Haley Joel Osment , one might wonder how regular human technology could possibly register their presence . We 're told that it all comes down to what people are made of . <p> \" We 're built out of energy -- atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nonprofit Paranormal Explorers ghost-hunting group , which operates out of Edmonton , Canada . \" I just think it 's an internal piece of us that stays when our bodies deteriorate . \" <p> \" When somebody dies , do they go into another dimension , with a very thin wall ? \" asks her partner , Ben Myckan . \" I think that 's sort of what it is . You ca n't destroy energy , it 's just in a different dimension . \" <p> So apparently , it 's not so much about looking for lost souls as it is looking for unexplained energy , or evidence of its manipulation . <h> EMF meter <p> When it comes to detecting energy , an electromagnetic field meter is definitely a good tool to have . \" At a haunted location , erratic and fluctuating EMF levels are likely to occur , \" says Alexandra Woodfield , of UK-based paranormal gear retailer TomsGadgets . \" Out of all the paranormal tools , the EMF meter is an excellent introduction to ghost detecting . Although currently there is no device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EMF meter is the closest tool on the market . \" <p> Rona and Ben use their EMF meters partially to identify man-made electrical fields within buildings , as some researchers have suggested that supposed ghost sightings could be caused by such fields interacting with the human brain . The couple are also interested in detecting EMFs in places where no electrical features are present , however , as those could be caused by ... well , you know . <h> Thermometer <p> Anderson tells us that ghosts both gather energy from rooms and release it into them , causing highly localized drops or rises in temperatures -- hence the \" cold spots \" you might have heard mentioned in horror movies . A good thermometer will confirm that such perceived changes are n't just due to heebie-jeebies on the part of the observer , and will document exactly how large the changes are . \" It has to be at least a ten-degree drop before we think , ' Oh , well maybe something 's happening in this room ' , \" she explains . <p> Besides a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point-and-shoot model , that can instantly obtain temperature readings from any point that it 's aimed at within a room . <h> Digital audio recorder <p> Ghosts supposedly do sometimes want to talk to us , but not in a way that 's easy to understand in real time with the unaided human ear . Proponents of Electric Voice Phenomenon ( EVP ) tell us that if you record the room noise while asking questions aloud to the ghost , although you may hear nothing in response at the time , you 'll be able to make out some replies when you play back the audio file . If you 've heard EVP on any of the numerous paranormal reality TV shows , however , then you will know that a lot of those \" replies \" can be pretty faint and ambiguous . <p> Having to pick out the ghost 's end of a conversation after the fact kind of limits what you can talk about , but a new product offers a way around that limitation . Connecticut 's DAS Distribution makes a gizmo called the RT-EVP , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on a time delay -- that delay can be from 1 to 60 seconds , as set by the user . If you were to set the delay for five seconds , for instance , you would ask a question , then hear a recording of yourself asking the question , followed by an ongoing playback of whatever audio the device recorded in the room just five seconds ago . <p> Because it can pick up sounds down to 15Hz , which is below the threshold of human hearing , it can indeed \" hear \" things that we ca n't ... possibly even the voices of lost loved ones , according to product designer and DAS president Gary Galka . \" Since the completion of the RT-EVP instrument , we have received three beautiful etheral messages from our daughter Melissa , \" he tells us . <h> Ghost Box <p> While EVP can allegedly be found in ambient sound , it 's said to be easier for ghosts to work their voice messages into white noise , which is where something called the Ghost Box or Spirit Box comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposedly allowing ghosts to use stray bits of static , squeal and other noise to form and\/or carry their messages . The RT-EVP , in fact , has a \" frequency sweep \" feature that lets it operate as a Ghost Box . <p> For her part , Anderson believes that Ghost Boxes have their place , but ca n't be relied upon . This is due to the simple fact that what is being heard could very likely just be distant radio broadcasts . \" The only way you know is probably what they 're saying , \" she says . \" If they say ' Help me , ' or ' My name is Joan , ' you 're going , OK well that does n't sound like a radio station . \" <p> A somewhat similar device is the Ovilus . It takes temperature and EMF readings , combines those readings into one number , chooses a word from an onboard database that matches up with that number , and then \" speaks \" the word aloud . The idea is that a ghost , knowing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will purposely make changes to the temperature and EMFs so that it can communicate through the Ovilus . Should you not want to shell out for the device itself , though , you can always download the iOvilus app to your iPhone . Just do n't believe everything it tells you ... <p> The Ovilus \" works \" on the same principle as Ouija boards , which many ghost-hunters steer clear of , as they are said to open up portals that anyone or anything could come through . \" You 're not necessarily going to get who you think you 're going to get , \" says Anderson , of the boards . \" We 've had people who have called us to come and do an investigation because they 've used a Ouija board and someone 's dropped in and has n't left . \" <p> In other words , go ahead and download iOvilus , but do n't blame us if you end up getting sucked into your TV . <h> Motion detector or beam barrier alarm <p> \" These are also used for security by creating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodfield . \" Paranormal activity can trigger these beams and set off an alarm . Of course it is important to set up a digital video camera to eliminate tampering from other people or animals . \" <p> Rona and Ben also use a Trail Master camera trap , in which a motion detector is wired directly to a digital still camera , which snaps a shot whenever the detector is tripped . The setup is commonly used in the wilderness by wildlife photographers , or even cryptozoologists looking for Bigfoot ... but that 's another article . <h> Infrared wireless cameras <p> When it comes to digital video cameras , Paranormal Explorers and most other groups use the infrared variety , running several of them into a split-screen display on a laptop . That way , they can show the client what their eyes might be missing , and make a DVD copy of the footage for them . Just what might that footage show ? <p> \" Sometimes you might just see something floating around , \" says Myckan . \" You might see just a ball of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ectoplasm , and it might be in the shape of something . \" <p> \" Usually , when people watch it on TV , they really seem to have an epiphany , and they seem to be not frightened anymore , \" adds Anderson . <p> Digital still cameras are also considered essential gear , both for showing up things that us humans ca n't see ( such as in Paranormal Explorers ' shot below , possibly ) , and simply for documenting locations where investigations are carried out . <p> It could be that one of the most useful things to have , however , is simply good \" ghost sense . \" <p> \" When we go into a house that is supposed to be plagued by stuff , I do rely on my intuition , \" says Anderson . \" Usually I can pick up right away if there are spirits . \" <p> So , is it possible that any of these instruments -- or even the human subconscious -- could be detecting anything from the great beyond ? We look forward to receiving your comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" Do n't cross the streams . \" <p> Advertisement <p> About the Author <p> An experienced freelance writer , videographer and television producer , Ben 's interest in all forms of innovation is particularly fanatical when it comes to human-powered transportation , film-making gear , environmentally-friendly technologies and anything that 's designed to go underwater .

This meter has been around for a long time and is used in not only for people in the job field where one would deal with electricity , but also in the scientific field for research . They are also very useful for finding out if any of the electronic devices in you home have a high electromagnetic field . High electromagnetic fields could be harmful . <p> The thermometer : REALLY ? You did not know that this was invented for reading temperatures ? Not to mention that it is used on a daily basis by practically everyone ? Especially Doctors and hospitals . <p> The digital audio recorder : Also Has been around for a long time . It was created as a portable device for recording audio . Its very common for journalists and college students to use this . <p> Motion detector : These were created for security purposes .

And if you have ever come across one they are clearly marked that it is for entertainment purposes only . As was ( and still is ) the Ouija board . <p> The other comments on here are not much better . I am very surprised that people who would read gizmag would not know of the existence of a thermometer for purposes other then ghost hunting . Truly amazing . <p> For those who have a fascination with what are commonly referred to as \" ghost \" - I have a question . It is easy to establish that creatures do exist in the invisible realm , so I will not try to discredit that . However , the same people who believe in them have no idea about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

aimed at within a room . <h> digital audio recorder <p> ghosts supposedly do sometimes want to talk to us , but not in a way that 's easy to understand in real time with the unaided human ear . proponents of electric voice phenomenon ( evp ) tell us that if you record the room noise while asking questions aloud to the ghost , although you may hear nothing in response at the time , you 'll be able to make out some replies when you play back the audio file . if you 've heard evp on any of the numerous paranormal reality tv shows , however , then you will know that a lot of those \" replies \" can be pretty faint and ambiguous . <p> having to pick out the ghost 's end of a conversation after the fact kind of limits what you can talk about , but a new product offers a way around that limitation . connecticut 's das distribution makes a gizmo called the rt-evp , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on a time delay -- that delay can be from 1 to 60 seconds , as set by the user . if you were to set the delay for five seconds , for instance , you would ask a question , then hear a recording of yourself asking the question , followed by an ongoing playback of whatever audio the device recorded in the room just five seconds ago . <p> because it can pick up sounds down to 15hz , which is below the threshold of human hearing , it can indeed \" hear \" things that we ca n't ... possibly even the voices of lost loved ones , according to product designer and das president gary galka . \" since the completion of the rt-evp instrument , we have received three beautiful etheral messages from our daughter melissa , \" he tells us . <h> ghost box <p> while evp can allegedly be found in ambient sound , it 's said to be easier for ghosts to work their voice messages into white noise , which is where something called the ghost box or spirit box comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposedly allowing ghosts to use stray bits of static , squeal and other noise to form and\/or carry their messages . the rt-evp , in fact , has a \" frequency sweep \" feature that lets it operate as a ghost box . <p> for her part , anderson believes that ghost boxes have their place , but ca n't be relied upon . this is due to the simple fact that what is being heard could very likely just be distant radio broadcasts . \" the only way you know is probably what they 're saying , \" she says . \" if they say ' help me , ' or ' my name is joan , ' you 're going , ok well that does n't sound like a radio station . \" <p> a somewhat similar device is the ovilus . it takes temperature and emf readings , combines those readings into one number , chooses a word from an onboard database that matches up with that number , and then \" speaks \" the word aloud . the idea is that a ghost , knowing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will purposely make changes to the temperature and emfs so that it can communicate through the ovilus . should you not want to shell out for the device itself , though , you can always download the iovilus app to your iphone . just do n't believe everything it tells you ... <p> the ovilus \" works \" on the same principle as ouija boards , which many ghost-hunters steer clear of , as they are said to open up portals that anyone or anything could come through . \" you 're not necessarily going to get who you think you 're going to get , \" says anderson , of the boards . \" we 've had people who have called us to come and do an investigation because they 've used a ouija board and someone 's dropped in and has n't left . \" <p> in other words , go ahead and download iovilus , but do n't blame us if you end up getting sucked into your tv . <h> motion detector or beam barrier alarm <p> \" these are also used for security by creating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodfield . \" paranormal activity can trigger these beams and set off an alarm . of course it is important to set up a digital video camera to eliminate tampering from other people or animals . \" <p> rona and ben also use a trail master camera trap , in which a motion detector is wired directly to a digital still camera , which snaps a shot whenever the detector is tripped . the setup is commonly used in the wilderness by wildlife photographers , or even cryptozoologists looking for bigfoot ... but that 's another article . <h> infrared wireless cameras <p> when it comes to digital video cameras , paranormal explorers and most other groups use the infrared variety , running several of them into a split-screen display on a laptop . that way , they can show the client what their eyes might be missing , and make a dvd copy of the footage for them . just what might that footage show ? <p> \" sometimes you might just see something floating around , \" says myckan . \" you might see just a ball of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ectoplasm , and it might be in the shape of something . \" <p> \" usually , when people watch it on tv , they really seem to have an epiphany , and they seem to be not frightened anymore , \" adds anderson . <p> digital still cameras are also considered essential gear , both for showing up things that us humans ca n't see ( such as in paranormal explorers ' shot below , possibly ) , and simply for documenting locations where investigations are carried out . <p> it could be that one of the most useful things to have , however , is simply good \" ghost sense . \" <p> \" when we go into a house that is supposed to be plagued by stuff , i do rely on my intuition , \" says anderson . \" usually i can pick up right away if there are spirits . \" <p> so , is it possible that any of these instruments -- or even the human subconscious -- could be detecting anything from the great beyond ? we look forward to receiving your comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" do n't cross the streams . \" <p> advertisement <p> about the author <p> an experienced freelance writer , videographer and television producer , ben 's interest in all forms of innovation is particularly fanatical when it comes to human-powered transportation , film-making gear , environmentally-friendly technologies and anything that 's designed to go underwater . he lives in edmonton , alberta , where he spends a lot of time going over the handlebars of his mountain bike , hanging out in off-leash parks , and wishing the pacific ocean was n't so far away . <p> there are no \" ghost \" outside of ones imagination , but there is something to be aware of . it is true \" you ca n't destroy energy \" - that is why when we die our life force goes out with our last breath and we return to the dust or elements we are made with . when we are cremated , we still end up as ashes or elements . the invisible realm does have living and powerful wicked spirit forces which take delight in misleading mankind . why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be destroyed ? the answers are easy to find . and peace of mind and a happy future is your reward by searching for the truth . <p>

A serial spouse who famously married seven men , Taylor bounced between properties with similar whimsy . Born in 1932 to American expat parents in North London , she spent the first years of her life in the United Kingdom at Heathwood House , the family home ( above ) . The 5,092-square-foot brick Georgian , built in 1926 , featured six bedrooms , three bathrooms , and expansive gardens tended by Elizabeth 's mother , Sara Taylor . In 2008 , the home came to market for over $10M and quickly sold . Despite her British upbringing , it was n't until she came to America in 1940 that her many love affairs with real estate were kindled . <p> ? Taylor lived briefly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were married for less than a year before divorcing , which is when Taylor moved out on her own , to an apartment block at 1060 Wilshire Boulevard in L.A. that 's now been replaced with new construction . Her downstairs neighbors in the building were star couple Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis . <p> ? Once married , Taylor and second husband Michael Wilding began a haphazard house hunt that involved purchasing a Beverly Hills home in the summer of 1952 for $75K -- $600K in today 's dollars -- and spending another $40K sprucing it up , before abandoning the house two years later for the comfort of an even more opulent home at 1375 Beverly Estate Drive(above) . She and Wilding decided to buy after scaling the fence surrounding the property for an impromptu open house . As luck would have it , architect George MacLean had designed the home with Taylor in mind . <p> ? After Taylor divorced Wilding in 1957 , she took up with film producer Mike Todd . Todd tragically died in a private plane crash the following year , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 715 Park Avenue(above) . The building , set on the southeast corner of 70th Street and Park Avenue , was built in 1948 . The apartment -- which , according to the brokerage Corcoran , once also served as the home of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous host Robin Leach -- features two bedrooms and a 775-square-foot terrace that probably served as a garden for green thumb Taylor . <p> Photo : Reportair ? Taylor went on to marry Mike Todd 's best friend , crooner Eddie Fisher . Fisher and Taylor soon purchased a getaway in the Swiss mountain town of Gstaad , which was becoming increasingly popular with jet-setters in the 60s . Taylor entertained a slew of stars at Chalet Ariel , including Julie Andrews , Peter Sellers , Robert Wagner , Natalie Wood , and Roger Moore , and retained ownership of the property after divorcing Fisher in 1964 . <p> ? Taylor was enamored with the snows of the Swiss Alps , but that did n't keep her from sunning herself on occasion . For those purposes , she and fifth husband Richard Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Puerto Vallarta , Mexico . Joined by a bridge modeled after the Bridge of Sighs in Venice ( above ) , the residences were operated as a bed-and-breakfast , after Taylor sold the property in 1990 , before it fell into disrepair . <p> Photo : dbking\/Flickr ? In 1976 , Taylor fell in love with Virginia politician John Warner and shacked up with him at his 2,700-acre Atoka Farm and his Georgetown pied-a-terre , a lavish red brick Georgian ( above ) near the famous Dumbarton Oaks estate . Warner 's long hours as a U.S. Senator led to their divorce in 1982 , and Taylor soon moved back to the West Coast . <p> ? Since the early ' 80s , Taylor had been living in this stealthy two-story in Bel Air , Calif .

This morning our Everest team have made the summit of Mt . Everest <p> A 32 years lady from Arunachal Pradesh , India Anshu Jamsenpa along with team Sirdar Mr Lakpa Rangdu Sherpa , Nima Nuru Sherpa , Lakpa Chiree Sherpa , and Miss Churim Sherpa reached on the summit of Everest on 12th May , 7.00 am ( Nepali local time ) in the morning . Anshu and Sherpas have started their summit push from South Col last night at about 8pm . They are now descending for Camp II and will arrive at Base Camp by tomorrow . <p> Miss . Churim Sherpa , age 27 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 days starting from KTM on 18th April and reach on the summit of Mt . Everest on 12th May . I think this is some thing special and it might be a new record among the Nepalese women Mt . Everest Summiteers . <p> Our 2nd Summit team has started from Base Camp today morning and they have planned to attempt summit on 15th morning , as 16th morning looks pretty high wind speed . <p> This is a picture of the popular South Col Route up Mt . Everest . Base camp is located at 17,500 feet . This is where climbers begin their true trip up the mountain . This is also where support staff often remain to monitor the expeditions and provide medical assistance when necessary . Many organizations offer hiking trips which just go to base camp as the trip is not technically challenging ( though you must be very fit ) . <p> From base camp , climbers typically train and acclimate ( permitting the body to adjust to the decreased oxygen in the air ) by traveling and bringing supplies back and forth through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues throughout the climb , with the final summit push often being the only time to climbers do not go back and forth between camps to train , bring supplies , and recuperate for the next push . <p> The Icefall is in constant motion . It contains enormous ice seracs , often larger than houses , which dangle precariously over the climbers heads , threatening to fall at any moment without warning , as the climbers cross endless crevasses and listen to continuous ice creaking below . This often acts as a testing ground to judge if less experienced climbers will be capable of continuing . The Icefall is located between 17,500 and 19,500 feet . <h> Camp I - 5900 meters <p> After the Icefall , the climbers arrive at Camp I , which is located at 19,500 feet . Depending on the type of expedition , Camp I will either be stocked by the climbers as they ascend and descend the Icefall , or by Sherpas in advance . <p> The area between Camp I and Camp II is known as the Western Cwm . As the climbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily out of sight of their support at Base camp . Nonetheless , modern communication devises permit the parties to stay in contact . <h> Camp II - 6500 meters <p> As the climbers leave Camp II , they travel towards the Lhotse face ( Lhotse is a 27,920 foot mountain bordering Everest ) . The Lhotse face is a steep , shiny icy wall . Though not technically extremely difficult , one misstep or slip could mean a climber 's life . Indeed , many climbers have lost their lives through such mishaps . <h> Camp III - 23,700 feet ( 7200 meters ) <p> To reach Camp III , climbers must negotiate the Lhotse Face . Climbing a sheer wall of ice demands skill , strength and stamina . It is so steep and treacherous that many Sherpas move directly from Camp II to Camp IV on the South Col , refusing to stay on the Lhotse Face . <h> Camp IV - 26,300 feet ( 8000 meters ) <p> As you ? re leaving C4 ? it ? s a little bit of a down slope , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow on the ledges to walk down on , interspersed with rock , along with some fixed rope . The problem with the rope is that the anchors are bad , and there ? s not much holding the rope and a fall could be serious . Fortunately it ? s not too steep , but there is a ton of exposure and people are usually tired when walking down from camp . The rock is a little down sloping to the right as well , and with crampons on , it can be bit tricky with any kind of wind . There ? s a little short slope on reliable snow which leads to the top of the Geneva Spur , and the wind pressure gradient across the spur can increase there as you ? re getting set up for the rappel . Wearing an oxygen mask here can create some footing issues during the rappel , because it ? s impossible to see over the mask and down to the feet . For that reason , some people choose to leave Camp 4 without gas , as it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s important to see all the small rock steps and where the old feet are going . Navigating down through all of the spaghetti of fixed ropes is a bit of a challenge , especially with mush for brains at that point . One lands on some lower ledges which aren ? t so steep , where fixed ropes through here are solid . At this point , it ? s just a matter of staying upright , and usually , the wind has died significantly after dropping off the Spur . The route turns hard to the left onto the snowfield that leads to the top of the Yellow Bands . <p> Camp IV , which is at 26,300 on the Lhotse face , is typically the climbers ' first overnight stay in the Death Zone . The Death Zone is above 26,000 feet . Though there is nothing magical about that altitude , it is at this altitude that most human bodies lose all ability to acclimate . Accordingly , the body slowly begins to deteriorate and die - thus , the name \" Death Zone . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely illness ( HACE - high altitude cerebral edema - or HAPE - high altitude pulmonary edema ) or death will occur . Most climbers will use oxygen to climb and sleep at this altitude and above . Generally , Sherpas refuse to sleep on the Lhotse face and will travel to either Camp II or Camp IV . <p> Camp IV is located at 26,300 feet . This is the final major camp for the summit push . It is at this point that the climbers make their final preparations . It is also a haven for worn-out climbers on their exhausting descent from summit attempts ( both successful and not ) . Sherpas or other climbers will often wait here with supplies and hot tea for returning climbers . <p> From Camp IV , climbers will push through the Balcony , at 27,500 feet , to the Hillary Step at 28,800 feet . The Hillary Step , an over 70 foot rock step , is named after Sir . Edmond Hillary , who in 1953 , along with Tenzing Norgay , became the first people to summit Everest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes , often becomes a bottleneck as only one climber can climb at a time . Though the Hillary Step would not be difficult at sea level for experienced climbers , at Everest 's altitude , it is considered the most technically challenging aspect of the climb . <h> Summit - 29,028 feet ( 8848 meters ) <p> Once the climbers ascend the Hillary Step , they slowly and laboriously proceed to the summit at 29,028 feet . The summit sits at the top of the world . Though not the closest place to the sun due to the earth 's curve , it is the highest peak on earth . Due to the decreased air pressure , the summit contains less than one third the oxygen as at sea level . If dropped off on the summit directly from sea level ( impossible in reality ) , a person would die within minutes . Typically , climbers achieving the great summit will take pictures , gain their composure , briefly enjoy the view , then return to Camp IV as quickly as possible . The risk of staying at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great to permit climbers to fully enjoy the great accomplishment at that moment . <p> As most readers of this page know , the return trip can be even more dangerous than the climb to the summit . <p> Millet One Sport Everest Boot Expedition and mountaineering boot for high altitude and extremely cold conditions . The Everest has conquered all 14 mountains over 8,000m and also the Seven Summits- and has now had a makeover to ensure continued peak preformance .

        "text":"<h> Related images ( click to enlarge ) <p> ORNL <p> Researchers at the Department of Energy 's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee have for the first time successfully characterized the earliest structural formation of the disease type of the protein that causes Huntington 's disease . The incurable , hereditary neurological disorder is always fatal and affects one in 10,000 Americans . Huntington 's disease is caused by a renegade protein \" huntingtin \" that destroys neurons in areas of the brain concerned with the emotions , intellect and movement . All humans have the normal huntingtin protein , which is known to be essential to human life , although its true biological functions remain unclear . <p> Christopher Stanley , a Shull Fellow in the Neutron Scattering Science Division at ORNL , and Valerie Berthelier , a UT Graduate School of Medicine researcher who studies protein folding and misfolding in Huntington 's , have used a small-angle neutron scattering instrument , called Bio-SANS , at ORNL 's High Flux Isotope Reactor to explore the earliest aggregate species of the protein that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berthelier , in research published today in Biophysical Journal , were able to determine the size and mass of the mutant protein structures ? from the earliest small , spherical precursor species composed of two ( dimers ) and three ( trimers ) peptides ? along the aggregation pathway to the development of the resulting , later-stage fibrils . They were also able to see inside the later-stage fibrils and determine their internal structure , which provides additional insight into how the peptides aggregate . <p> \" Bio-SANS is a great instrument for taking time-resolved snapshots . You can look at how this stuff changes as a function of time and be able to catch the structures at the earliest of times , \" Stanley said . \" When you study several of these types of systems with different glutamines or different conditions , you begin to learn more and more about the nature of these aggregates and how they begin forming . \" <p> Normal huntingtin contains a region of 10 to 20 glutamine amino acids in succession . However , the DNA of Huntington 's disease patients encodes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that contain this abnormally long glutamine repeat . Consequentially , the mutant protein fragment can not be degraded normally and instead forms deposits of fibrils in neurons . <p> Those deposits , or clumps , were originally seen as the cause of the devastation that ensues in the brain . More recently researchers think the clumping may actually be a kind of biological housecleaning , an attempt by the brain cells to clean out these toxic proteins from places where they are destructive . Stanley and Berthelier set out to learn through neutron scattering what the toxic proteins were and when and where they occurred . <p> At the HFIR Bio-SANS instrument , the neutron beam comes through a series of mirrors that focus it on the sample . The neutrons interact with the sample , providing data on its atomic structure , and then the neutrons scatter , to be picked up by a detector . From the data the detector sends of the scattering pattern , researchers can deduce at a scale of less than billionths of a meter the size and shape of the diseased , aggregating protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SANS was able to distinguish the small peptide aggregates in the sample solution from the rapidly forming and growing larger aggregates that are simultaneously present . In separate experiments , they were able to monitor the disappearance of the single peptides , as well as the formation of the mature fibrils . <p> Now that they know the structures , the hope is to develop drugs that can counteract the toxic properties in the early stages , or dissuade them from taking the path to toxicity . \" The next step would be , let 's take drug molecules and see how they can interact and affect these structures , \" Stanley said . <p> For now , the researchers believes Bio-SANS will be useful in the further study of Huntington 's disease aggregates and applicable for the study of other protein aggregation processes , such as those involved in Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases . <p> \" That is the future hope . Right now , we feel like we are making a positive contribution towards that goal , \" Stanley said . ",

From anthropomorphic animals and objects to low brow live action lessons in caring and sharing , Hollywood can churn out the kiddie chum with shocking regularity . Every week , a new affront to taste and future therapist 's visits . Perhaps even more astonishing is the public 's -- or make that , parent 's -- lack of consideration in making choices for their wee ones . They will literally buy almost anything , just as long as it has the requisite amount of slapstick and stupidity to keep their offspring out of their hair for a while . As an ersatz babysitter , the PG to G rated entertainment has gone from being amiable to merely available . As a result , picking ten examples of cinema 's worst is a lot like shuffling CG penguins around a ritzy Manhattan apartment ... possible , but not a very pleasant experience overall . <p> In creating our list , we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't consider the animated film when compiling this list . Noxious cartoons are their own stagnant slice of Hell . Similarly , we did n't scour the shelves for knock-offs , clear copyright infringements like Ratatoing or The Little Panda Fighter , which leads to another category we tried to avoid . Bless them for their advances in style and concept , but the foreign film community can surely stink up the joint with their jaded , often harsh family fare . From the aforementioned Mr. Popper and his pooping water fowl ( in theaters now ! ) to something like Thunderpants ( about a kid gifted with the ability to fart really well ... no seriously ) , there are plenty of regular choices to choose from . In this case , we guarantee that all ten will challenge your view of viable kid vid material , as well as your will to live . <p> #10 : Ghost Dad ( 1990 ) <p> In the ' 90s , comedian turned ultimate TV dad Bill Cosby was seen as capable of doing absolutely no wrong . Granted , his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this uniformly terrible family film was -- hard to believe -- much , much worse . The tale of a workaholic widower desperate to make sure his kids are taken care of , even after a fatalistic cab rides banishes him to the afterlife , it 's a cloying combination of heart-tugging and sour slapstick . Perhaps the most shocking thing about this supernatural comedy is that Sydney Poitier was sitting the director 's chair . Horror ! <p> #9 : Santa with Muscles ( 1996 ) <p> Unlike many famous athletes who really have no business being up on the big screen , a wrestler like Hulk Hogan should have been a cinematic natural . After all , his entire career was built on successfully selling a grateful , gullible audience on the ' fact ' that his sport was ' real ' . However , his efforts in front of the camera , including the atrocious Mr. Nanny and Suburban Commando argued for a stilted , steroided stiff . Naturally , the next step was stupid , saccharine seasonal fare with the Hulkster playing amnesiac to a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't deserve this steamy , stinking bag of coal . <p> #8 : The Garbage Pail Kids Movie ( 1987 ) <p> How do you celebrate a ripe kid 's fad just waiting to be translated to the silver screen ? Why , you turn the property over to a guy who 'd done little of significance since The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis and then hire has-been Anthony Newley as your leading man . In addition , waste most of your limited budget on creepy costumes which barely resemble the famed collector 's card characters and then add in a bullied human boy to really up the ick factor . Aside from the often surreal visage of little people playing oversized cartoon caricatures , the real revelation comes from the movie 's rude and crude single digit IQ messages . <p> #7 : Kazaam ( 1996 ) <p> Speaking of athletes who should n't be allowed in front of craft services table ... When he abandoned Orlando for the sunny celebrity climes of LA , Shaquille O'Neal wanted to be more than an NBA superstar . Aside from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadly , O'Neal had all the presence of LeBron James during a decisive Game 6 . Playing a genie who wants to help an obnoxious little brat reconnect with his dad , he 's about as believable as the Miami Heat 's Big Three 's chances at multiple championships . Even the less than special effects argue for something that should have been quickly folded up and forgotten . <p> #6 : The Country Bears ( 2002 ) <p> You ca n't talk about lousy family films and not send a little karmic creosote Disney 's way , right ? After all , the House of Mouse more or less invented the crappy kids movie during those depressing dog days of the 1970s ( Super Dad ? Gus ? ) . In this case , the company was trying to parlay their famed theme park rides into substantial film franchises . In the case of this moronic costumed creature feature , nothing worked . The suits looks stupid . The casting was questionable and , worse of all , the actual attraction was cast aside for more formulaic flotsam . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nuance and acting ability than the stiffs here . <p> Since deciding to employ his underdeveloped muse muscles over five years ago , Bill has been a significant staff member and writer for three of the Web 's most influential websites : DVD Talk , DVD Verdict and , of course , PopMatters . He also has expanded his own web presence with Bill Gibron.com a place where he further explores creative options .

        "text":"<h> Got a hot tip ? tell us about it ! <h> Six questions hoteliers should ask providers of cloud-based systems <p> IBM did just that and surveyed 3,000 of them in its 2011 IBM Global CIO study , which found that CIO interest in cloud computing notched the greatest category increase compared with results from its survey two years earlier . <p> And , if you consider virtualization -- when virtual servers are created on a single piece of hardware -- part of a private cloud strategy , and you should , then interest is even greater in cloud technologies than the chart indicates . <p> However , in most cases , I would n't expect to see hoteliers deploy their own cloud instances , but they are more likely to use CRS , PMS and RMS systems via a Software-as-a-Service model . Cloud\/SaaS can bring many advantages over on-premise solutions for hoteliers . Among them : <p> Access to the latest version without the pain often associated with upgrades ; <p> Removal of the burden of application and infrastructure management ; and <p> Potential for heightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry voice concerns regarding availability , security and disaster recovery . And , Wolfe notes that part of HFTP 's role is to help educate its members about the pros and cons of cloud computing and help eliminate misinformation , which fuels fear , uncertainty and doubt . <p> I understand that hoteliers worry about being cut off from their PMS and not being able to check in guests , or their CRS and not being able to take reservations , which can be disastrous given that room nights are a perishable good . Further , I can understand how events such as cloud outages and the ensuing headlines can fan the flames . <p> The cloud does not fix poorly designed applications automagically , but good software design and architecture can address availability and security issues and it must take the computing environment into consideration . <p> But in evaluating whether to choose a cloud\/SaaS solution over on premise you also need to do an honest evaluation of your own IT organization 's ability to manage your infrastructure . Google 's cloud-based Gmail service offers 99.984% availability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation . <p> In addition , the cloud is being used by the federal government and financial institutions , both of which likely have stricter , more complicated regulatory requirements than most hotels . <p> And , major cloud platforms offer better physical and network security than virtually all hotel chains can provide . These examples show that the cloud is not inherently less secure or less available than on premise solutions . <p> So , that being said , what are the six questions that you should ask hospitality software suppliers about their cloud offering , whether you 're at HITEC or not : <p> 1 . Is it really cloud ? You may think this a bit pedantic , but there is an awful lot of cloud-washing going on in the enterprise software business , so there 's no reason to think that hospitality software should be any different . There is so much buzz about \" the cloud \" that some may use the term while not implementing their solution in a public cloud manner . Some may simply be offering a hosted model in their own datacenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like virtualization , but this is not necessarily the same thing . Some of the key aspects of real cloud offerings include : infinite bi-directional elasticity ; pay for what you use ; and detailed monitoring and reporting ( governance ) <p> 2 . Do you have Service Level Agreements on RTO\/RPO ? OK , let 's start with a few definitions . RTO is Recovery Time Objective and RPO is Recovery Point Objective . These are critical disaster recovery attributes . Bascially they translates into how fast will you get my application back up and how far back in time are you backing up my data . If vendors do n't have SLAs on RPO then they 're likely not using continuous data protection techniques and you have a greater risk of losing data if the app crashes . <p> 3 . What are the availability SLAs ? It 's one thing to quote uptime in marketing materials , but at some point you have to put your money where your mouth is . The penalties never truly make up for the loss of service , but it gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for how you should evaluate that performance against an existing solution . <p> 4 . Is there an offline mode ? Just because something is cloud-based does n't mean it only works when you 're online . There are techniques that can enable some level of offline functionality and then automatically synchronize when you 're back online . <p> 5 . What about integration ? A PMS or a CRS have to talk with other solutions , whether it be restaurant , golf facility , spa or accounting systems . One of the challenges in the early days of SaaS in the enterprise was that it was difficult to knit together different systems . Some companies build their own integrations , others use platforms like Boomi ( acquired by Dell last year ) . But you need to find out what systems they integrate with automatically and check that against the other systems that you need to connect with . If there are gaps , ask the company how it will help you close them . <p> 6 . How can I get my data back out ? This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will gladly tell you how easy it is to get onboard , but rarely are they forthcoming about how you can get your data back out . Some refer to this as data portability . It 's critically important as you may need to change systems if you change flags or if you just do n't like the way the platform works . Be sure you are comfortable with the flexibility provided . <p> Cloud computing can be a very useful tool for hoteliers . But before you make the move , be sure that you ask the right questions and get the right answers when choosing a platform . <p> Hi Glean , i agree with your 6 points . Especially in the first point you have raised a important question that is \" is it really cloud \" , cause as a Hotel Management software provider hoteliers mostly ask us the different between cloud based and web based hospitality management software . <p> A good piece and I agree with Glenn , not just restricted to hoteliers in the travel industry . These questions apply just as much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in questions pertaining to the security of data . Especially in light of the recent data loss by giants like Sony . <p> These are great questions but are not just limited to hoteliers . I think it would be safe to say that any business considering porting to a cloud based SaaS should be asking these key questions . Thanks Glenn . ",

        "title":"D-Dalus - an entirely new genre of aircraft\n",
        "text":"<h> D-Dalus - an entirely new genre of aircraft arrives <p> Austrian research company IAT21 has presented a new type of aircraft at the Paris Air Show which has the potential to become aviation 's first disruptive technology since the jet engine . <p> The D-Dalus ( a play on Daedalus from Greek mythology ) is neither fixed wing or rotor craft and uses four , mechanically-linked , contra-rotating cylindrical turbines , each running at the same 2200 rpm , for its propulsion . <p> The key to the D-Dalus ' extreme maneuverability is the facility to alter the angle of the blades ( using servos ) to vector the forces , meaning that the thrust can be delivered in your choice of 360 degrees around any of the three axes . Hence D-Dalus can launch vertically , hover perfectly still and move in any direction , and that 's just the start of the story . <p> Like most cars and aircraft these days , it sounds very complex but it 's all controlled by computer algorithms , so it 's simple joystick control for the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Existing rotary wing aircraft offer VTOL capabilities but have vulnerabilities which make them unsuitable for many applications . They are challenged in bad weather , at long ranges , at high speed and in operating to and from lurching platforms , such as boats in rough weather . <p> By contrast , D-Dalus is particularly suited for such conditions and can thrust upwards and hence \" glue down \" on landing , which it can also do on a moving vehicle . Indeed , landing on a moving vehicle is one of the D-Dalus ' many party tricks , and it 's a natural for landing on watercraft . Not surprisingly , since it initially broke cover at the Royal Aeronautical Society conference a few days ago , it has already attracted a lot of interest from military quarters . <p> The D-Dalus is also near-silent , and has the dynamic stability to enter buildings and handle rough weather with ease - things which existing rotorcraft simply can not achieve . The aircraft also has a sense-and-avoid system which , in conjunction with its complete lack of vulnerable external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hover in very close proximity to vertical rock faces and walls , making it suitable for search-and-rescue operations , as a surveillance drone with hover-and-stare capabilities and as a proactive tool for urban battlefield situational awareness . <p> The lack of vulnerable external moving parts will give a small D-Dalus-type drone the ability to fly into buildings through windows , and its unique capabilities also offer 360 degree vision , another aspect lacking in traditional rotor craft which have blind spots due to the rotors , and nowhere near the same maneuverability as the D-Dalus . <p> IAT21 forsees many applications based on these key new criteria - apart from being able to enter and search buildings , it could conceivably remove radioactive contamination or explosives , extract casualties , or hold and direct water hoses for fire fighters . <p> As it can lift heavy loads , and becomes even more efficient in doing so as it scales upwards in size , it is also envisaged as a platform for loading and unloading ships when cranes are not available . <p> The D-Dalus is also so simple mechanically that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an auto mechanic . It should be noted that all VTOL aircraft capable of carrying large payloads are complex and very costly to maintain . <p> Currently , tests are being conducted using a 120 bhp KTM engine and turbines around five feet long - and the capability of lifting a payload of 70 kg . More tests are planned over the coming weeks . IAT21 is now also working with Cranfield University in the U.K. on a larger , more powerful motor , a new hull shape for the craft , and advanced guidance and control systems . <p> The forces on the blade pivots are understandably huge , and in initial testing it was found that all available bearings failed , so inventor Meinhard Schwaiger , who already has more than 150 patents to his name , knuckled down and invented ( and patented ) his own , near-frictionless swivel-bearing to cope with the stresses . <p> The D-Dalus is constructed of carbon fiber , and appears to be scalable for a range of potential applications including maritime search and rescue , freight transport , operating alongside and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform include a passenger version for public transit . <p> Advertisement <p> About the Author <p> Mike grew up thinking he would become a mathematician , accidentally started motorcycle racing , got a job writing road tests for a motorcycle magazine while at university , and became a writer . As a travelling photojournalist during his early career , his work was published in a dozen languages across 20+ countries . He went on to edit or manage over 50 print publications , with target audiences ranging from pensioners to plumbers , many different sports , many car and motorcycle magazines , with many more in the fields of communication - narrow subject magazines on topics such as advertising , marketing , visual communications , design , presentation and direct marketing . Then came the internet and Mike managed internet projects for Australia 's largest multimedia company , Telstra.com.au ( Australia 's largest Telco ) , Seek.com.au ( Australia 's largest employment site ) , top100.com.au , hitwise.com , and a dozen other internet start-ups before founding Gizmag in 2002 . Now he writes and thinks . <p> Sounds pretty revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing actually flying soon ... <p> Windmaster Hiroaki21st June , 2011 @ 12:30 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> My first thought was that it was a vastly improved ducted relative of the spinning wing ( 1930 ) . But from the info it seems like Centrifugal fans . It would be nice to have more details on the principles of flight involved . \" contra-rotating cylindrical turbines \" suggests it is more like the later . Are we talking turbos like in cars ? Seems like superchargers move more air . The 2,200 RPM sounds more like a fan and less obnoxious sounding than a turbo\/supercharger . The article also does not say where the air intake is . That seems like a major omission to me . Oh well , I guess we will hear more about it . <p> If it really is efficient , powerful , maneuverable , and easy to control , it might work in some sort of \" jetpack \" form . There was the scaling comment though ... so maybe not . <p> The actual numbers provided do not sound heavy lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real deal ... it looks very interesting . <p> I second the request for a video ! <p> Mindbreaker21st June , 2011 @ 4:53 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Someone on another site suggested it is a version of a Voith Schneider Propeller . That seems to fit . <p> Mindbreaker21st June , 2011 @ 5:07 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Sounds great , but I 'll believe it when I see it . I 've been burnt enough times by articles on gizmag making something sound like magic , only to come back the next week and debunk the myth . <p> Anyone remember that new dynamic ratio gearbox that was supposed to radically change the automotive industry forever ? No ? That 's because it turned out to be over-hyped crap . <p> Facebook User21st June , 2011 @ 5:44 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Excellent points Mindbreaker . And in retrospect , exciting as this is it lacks the helicopter 's ability to autorotate and glide from engine failure . Not that it should not still be persued however . Voith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6:04 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> This would be how ' alien ' space ships move about wouldnt it ? ? ? <p> Facebook User21st June , 2011 @ 6:38 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Amost silent ? I find that hard to believe . Anyone knows that air moving at high velocities and volumes make shitloads of noise regardless of how its created . Nontheless it sounds like something worth following to see how it developes . <p> Terry Penrose21st June , 2011 @ 7:51 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Waiting to see a video , but the technology sounds incredible . <p> Alan Hutcheson21st June , 2011 @ 7:52 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> come on . how hard is it to post a video if it 's legit ? <p> Looks bad without one . <p> Adrien21st June , 2011 @ 9:15 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> funny that this company is about 2km away from where I live , and I had never heard of it ... <p> Martin Ankerl22nd June , 2011 @ 5:06 a.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concept to the Fanwing idea by Pat Peebles . That has great potential as well , if thought about from \" outside the box \" of traditional aviation design .

( California Time ) <p> http : \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch ? v=uscW9RLcBpw here 's a video of the original concept - by an italian inventor . but the thing ca n't autorotate and land without engines - so it 's an UAV only technology for now . <p> K ? roly Hoss22nd June , 2011 @ 6:45 a.m .

( California Time ) <p> Thrust vectoring aside , it looks like it must have to rotate 90 degrees in order to change direction . With no lift created by wings , body or rotor , it must have to use substantial energy to stay aloft . I wonder if it can become the engine in a design that has , or can deploy , lifting surfaces for sustained flight ? <p> Muraculous22nd June , 2011 @ 7:37 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Hmmmm I guess there 's no point in mentioning that I had a similar design in mind for some years now , but sadly I never had the resources or the time to put it into practice : ) . My theory is that the concept already existed since the 50 ' and that secret military aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet . <p> This is huge , combined with high capacity energy storage devices , light weight super materials and modern computers it could well lead to the development of transportation devices from as small as individual hovercraft to future space ships . <p> Inertial engines FTW <p> Stefan Padureanu22nd June , 2011 @ 8:46 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Nice to see a Privateer get a novel idea to fly . But you ca n't get something for nothing . It is hard to fathom that this \" Vehicle \" would be practicle in any way . <p> My fear is our stupid Government inspite of all logic and known technologies that have already proven themselves will be duped into spending Taxpayer dollars to figure out that this \" Vehicle \" is a flop . <p> People want something that they ca n't have ( yet ) , an Anti-Gravity machine that runs on something other that Petroleum that out performs proven platforms in use today . <p> David Nance22nd June , 2011 @ 9:02 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Looking at the pictures it clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not engage enough air and will be heavy and inefficient . Hence it is not a disruptive technology . It would be nice if Gizmag authors were more highly trained in the fields they are commenting on . <p> Rohn22nd June , 2011 @ 9:06 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> It appears to be a gang of Tesla turbines . If so , credit should be given where it 's due , instead of attention whoring as to originality . The app seems original , the turbine ? Not so much to me . <p> solutions4circuits22nd June , 2011 @ 9:24 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Well , if they did n't come up with a video or a small prototype , the best I can say is that I wish this was true . I I 've send my full description of a teleportation system to Gizmag and still I 'm waiting for the review to be published . : ) <p> salvatore.forte22nd June , 2011 @ 9:43 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> We now live where Bladerunner and The Fifth Element went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10:37 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Maybe instead of pushing vast columns of air downward with fans it achieves lift as in a wing by moving\/rotating the wing like aerofoils through the air within the 2200 rpm cylinders , is this feasible ? The aerofoils obviously pivot for directional control and each of the four cylinder 's have six of them . By using gyro and computer it could be very stable as described . <p> dgate22nd June , 2011 @ 10:41 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> Like most things on Gizmag , I will wait to see if this ever actually pans out before getting excited about it . Mzungu , If anyone thinks ground traffic is bad , you ca n't imagine how bad it would be once even 0.1% of people fly to work . The constant noise , extreme fuel use , and \" skylock \" will very quickly change your mind and turn the public strongly against anyone flying low over their heads . For anyone in a city or town , imagine waiting in the air for clearance to proceed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) while using the same fuel a car would to drive 150MPH , because it will take the same or more fuel to sit still in the air as it does to fly at speed . Commuting by air is a highly unrealistic pipe dream of people with no foresight . High speed ground transport is orders of magnitude more efficient and less intrusive for large portions of the population travelling every day . Flying to work would be nothing like the freedom of driving a car with the ability to just pull over or stop where you want to . Luckily , the insurance alone will kill \" flying cars . \" <p> Mark in MI22nd June , 2011 @ 10:54 a.m . ( California Time ) <p> I was there until the article said \" frictionless bearing \" . Then I smiled and realised it was a PR article so full of exaggeration and falsehoods . Probably hoping to get dumb investors . <p> Stuart Halliday22nd June , 2011 @ 12:05 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> It 's obvious that the reason that there 's no video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it to the mechanical and aeronautical engineers of the world to assess the real-world viability of this concept , but for my part I am reminded of Moller 's sky car scam . <p> Bob Humbly22nd June , 2011 @ 12:24 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> The D-Dalus is certainly not based on a Tesla turbine , because between the rotating discs there are turnable wings mounted . To me this is a similar principle as is used for some vertical wind turbines . Depending on how the turnable wings are tilted during the rotation of the discs the resulting air draft can be directed into any direction . The noise of this type of turbine is very likely also not as strong as with propellers or gas turbines with high RPM , because there are no stationary wings and with 2200 RPM the whole thing is not extremely fast . But it wont be silent , especially if it is driven by a motorbike engine . <p> Why should we get-off from the ground ? A high speed train system running in low pressure underground tubes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CO2-free produced electricity . For todays aircraft this is absolutely impossible . <p> Newton2k122nd June , 2011 @ 1:50 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> D-Dalus . No it has bladed rotors , therefore it is not using Tesla turbine principle . <p> As with other aircraft , I.E. ducted fan , quad rotor &amp; Coanda effect machines on losing an engine they tend to glide like a brick . Therefore it would need to use a ballistic parachute or maybe mount on flying wing . <p> Otherwise it is brilliant as I would think maintainance is a killer in rotor aircraft . <p> \" As with other aircraft , I.E. ducted fan , quad rotor &amp; Coanda effect machines on losing an engine they tend to glide like a brick .

( California Time ) <p> Maybe the noise wo n't be all that bad as the rotors only turn 2200 rpm and the engine can be muffled . <p> Why does a technical publication such as this always post articles about \" Zero Polution \" vehicles ? There 's no such thing . Just because the vehicle is electric , compressed gas powerd or rubber band powered you have to get the energy from somewhere to start with . Imagane the polution from an electric vehicle if the charging recepticle is energized by an old coal fired generation plant ! <p> VHomer22nd June , 2011 @ 4:18 p.m .

( California Time ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as I am not that bright , but two things come to mind . <p> If you SHOW someone a working model before the patents are granted you run the risk of someone copying it with changes , so no first mover advantage there , litigation to follow . <p> Secondly easier to sell a concept with potential than a prototype that does n't work very well , but what would I know . <p> Nick Rowney22nd June , 2011 @ 5:47 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> Have a look at fanwing dot com and you 'll have the general idea of how this thing works . <p> bas22nd June , 2011 @ 5:58 p.m . ( California Time ) <p> I wonder where its Ah-Killeez heel is ? <p> At 2200 rpm I ca n't imagine it not making noise enough to be considered silent .

( California Time ) <p> Here is a Video of the first Test Flight of D-Dalus . This was broadcast about a month ago on the Austrian\/German Channel Servus TV . It 's in German . ",
        "lower_text":"<h> d-dalus - an entirely new genre of aircraft arrives <p> austrian research company iat21 has presented a new type of aircraft at the paris air show which has the potential to become aviation 's first disruptive technology since the jet engine . <p> the d-dalus ( a play on daedalus from greek mythology ) is neither fixed wing or rotor craft and uses four , mechanically-linked , contra-rotating cylindrical turbines , each running at the same 2200 rpm , for its propulsion . <p> the key to the d-dalus ' extreme maneuverability is the facility to alter the angle of the blades ( using servos ) to vector the forces , meaning that the thrust can be delivered in your choice of 360 degrees around any of the three axes . hence d-dalus can launch vertically , hover perfectly still and move in any direction , and that 's just the start of the story . <p> like most cars and aircraft these days , it sounds very complex but it 's all controlled by computer algorithms , so it 's simple joystick control for the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> existing rotary wing aircraft offer vtol capabilities but have vulnerabilities which make them unsuitable for many applications . they are challenged in bad weather , at long ranges , at high speed and in operating to and from lurching platforms , such as boats in rough weather . <p> by contrast , d-dalus is particularly suited for such conditions and can thrust upwards and hence \" glue down \" on landing , which it can also do on a moving vehicle . indeed , landing on a moving vehicle is one of the d-dalus ' many party tricks , and it 's a natural for landing on watercraft . not surprisingly , since it initially broke cover at the royal aeronautical society conference a few days ago , it has already attracted a lot of interest from military quarters . <p> the d-dalus is also near-silent , and has the dynamic stability to enter buildings and handle rough weather with ease - things which existing rotorcraft simply can not achieve . the aircraft also has a sense-and-avoid system which , in conjunction with its complete lack of vulnerable external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hover in very close proximity to vertical rock faces and walls , making it suitable for search-and-rescue operations , as a surveillance drone with hover-and-stare capabilities and as a proactive tool for urban battlefield situational awareness . <p> the lack of vulnerable external moving parts will give a small d-dalus-type drone the ability to fly into buildings through windows , and its unique capabilities also offer 360 degree vision , another aspect lacking in traditional rotor craft which have blind spots due to the rotors , and nowhere near the same maneuverability as the d-dalus . <p> iat21 forsees many applications based on these key new criteria - apart from being able to enter and search buildings , it could conceivably remove radioactive contamination or explosives , extract casualties , or hold and direct water hoses for fire fighters . <p> as it can lift heavy loads , and becomes even more efficient in doing so as it scales upwards in size , it is also envisaged as a platform for loading and unloading ships when cranes are not available . <p> the d-dalus is also so simple mechanically that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an auto mechanic . it should be noted that all vtol aircraft capable of carrying large payloads are complex and very costly to maintain . <p> currently , tests are being conducted using a 120 bhp ktm engine and turbines around five feet long - and the capability of lifting a payload of 70 kg . more tests are planned over the coming weeks . iat21 is now also working with cranfield university in the u.k. on a larger , more powerful motor , a new hull shape for the craft , and advanced guidance and control systems . <p> the forces on the blade pivots are understandably huge , and in initial testing it was found that all available bearings failed , so inventor meinhard schwaiger , who already has more than 150 patents to his name , knuckled down and invented ( and patented ) his own , near-frictionless swivel-bearing to cope with the stresses . <p> the d-dalus is constructed of carbon fiber , and appears to be scalable for a range of potential applications including maritime search and rescue , freight transport , operating alongside and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform include a passenger version for public transit . <p> advertisement <p> about the author <p> mike grew up thinking he would become a mathematician , accidentally started motorcycle racing , got a job writing road tests for a motorcycle magazine while at university , and became a writer . as a travelling photojournalist during his early career , his work was published in a dozen languages across 20+ countries . he went on to edit or manage over 50 print publications , with target audiences ranging from pensioners to plumbers , many different sports , many car and motorcycle magazines , with many more in the fields of communication - narrow subject magazines on topics such as advertising , marketing , visual communications , design , presentation and direct marketing . then came the internet and mike managed internet projects for australia 's largest multimedia company , telstra.com.au ( australia 's largest telco ) , seek.com.au ( australia 's largest employment site ) , top100.com.au , hitwise.com , and a dozen other internet start-ups before founding gizmag in 2002 . now he writes and thinks . <p> sounds pretty revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing actually flying soon ... <p> windmaster hiroaki21st june , 2011 @ 12:30 p.m . ( california time ) <p> my first thought was that it was a vastly improved ducted relative of the spinning wing ( 1930 ) . but from the info it seems like centrifugal fans . it would be nice to have more details on the principles of flight involved . \" contra-rotating cylindrical turbines \" suggests it is more like the later . are we talking turbos like in cars ? seems like superchargers move more air . the 2,200 rpm sounds more like a fan and less obnoxious sounding than a turbo\/supercharger . the article also does not say where the air intake is . that seems like a major omission to me . oh well , i guess we will hear more about it . <p> if it really is efficient , powerful , maneuverable , and easy to control , it might work in some sort of \" jetpack \" form . there was the scaling comment though ... so maybe not . <p> the actual numbers provided do not sound heavy lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real deal ... it looks very interesting . <p> i second the request for a video ! <p> mindbreaker21st june , 2011 @ 4:53 p.m .

( california time ) <p> maybe instead of pushing vast columns of air downward with fans it achieves lift as in a wing by moving\/rotating the wing like aerofoils through the air within the 2200 rpm cylinders , is this feasible ? the aerofoils obviously pivot for directional control and each of the four cylinder 's have six of them . by using gyro and computer it could be very stable as described . <p> dgate22nd june , 2011 @ 10:41 a.m . ( california time ) <p> like most things on gizmag , i will wait to see if this ever actually pans out before getting excited about it . mzungu , if anyone thinks ground traffic is bad , you ca n't imagine how bad it would be once even 0.1% of people fly to work . the constant noise , extreme fuel use , and \" skylock \" will very quickly change your mind and turn the public strongly against anyone flying low over their heads . for anyone in a city or town , imagine waiting in the air for clearance to proceed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) while using the same fuel a car would to drive 150mph , because it will take the same or more fuel to sit still in the air as it does to fly at speed . commuting by air is a highly unrealistic pipe dream of people with no foresight . high speed ground transport is orders of magnitude more efficient and less intrusive for large portions of the population travelling every day . flying to work would be nothing like the freedom of driving a car with the ability to just pull over or stop where you want to . luckily , the insurance alone will kill \" flying cars . \" <p> mark in mi22nd june , 2011 @ 10:54 a.m .

( california time ) <p> the d-dalus is certainly not based on a tesla turbine , because between the rotating discs there are turnable wings mounted . to me this is a similar principle as is used for some vertical wind turbines . depending on how the turnable wings are tilted during the rotation of the discs the resulting air draft can be directed into any direction . the noise of this type of turbine is very likely also not as strong as with propellers or gas turbines with high rpm , because there are no stationary wings and with 2200 rpm the whole thing is not extremely fast . but it wont be silent , especially if it is driven by a motorbike engine . <p> why should we get-off from the ground ? a high speed train system running in low pressure underground tubes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co2-free produced electricity . for todays aircraft this is absolutely impossible . <p> newton2k122nd june , 2011 @ 1:50 p.m .

Spirit of Hope is a new comic book anthology that aims to help provide some relief for those who have lost their homes , loved ones and livelihoods as a result of the devastating earthquakes . <p> This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links . Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue . <p> Freelance comic writer Alan Cowsill was approached by the Comic Book Alliance shortly after the earthquake and resulting tsunami hit Japan on March 11 this year , to see if he was interested in being involved in small charity project to raise money for the victims . He said \" Yes \" without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinging with messages from artists all over the world offering their help . The project quickly outgrew its \" small \" status and blossomed into a 52-page book . Within a week , it was clear that a 116-page graphic novel was where it was heading , and Alan was spending most of his time collating and organizing the artwork coming in from talented artists such as Nick Abadzis , Liam Sharp and Henry Flint . <p> With the artwork flying in to a special FTP ( donated by one of Alan 's regular employers , Eaglemoss Publishing ) , Alan set about deciding on the running order . <p> \" Jimmy Broxton one of DC Comics ' leading artists sent his amazing image in . It screamed cover to me ... but we already had a great Mike Allred cover . Luckily this is comics where variants are the norm .

You can buy a copy ( with your choice of cover ) directly from the Comic Book Alliance for ? 14.99 plus shipping ( ? 3 for UK , ? 5 for the rest of the world ) with all the proceeds going to Second Harvest and the New Zealand Red Cross . The first 350 copies ordered directly from the CBA will also receive three A5 prints -- of both covers ( shown above ) and Mark Buckingham 's piece ( show on the right ) , and there 's also a digital version in the works too . <p> The best thing about an anthology of this sort is being exposed to new writers and artists that you may not have heard of before , and seeing the myriad of different illustration and writing styles that they use . Fine art watercolors sit side-by-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted art , crisp vector illustrations vie for your attention with digital paintings -- and , not surprisingly , Hokusai 's The Great Wave is a recurring motif . Similarly , the writing styles range from the comedic to the serious , from haikus to diaries , and from poetry to history and science lessons . Some eschew a \" story \" for a few choice words to compliment the pictures , others still forgo words entirely and let the pictures speak for themselves . All make you think about what the victims of these natural disasters are going through . <p> \" The Ship , \" by Richmond Clements and Inko , starts off by showing a baby having his bath and playing with a toy ship whilst his doting mother looks on . The pale blue of the ship is the only color in the strip , and in the later panels we see it lying amongst the debris . It 's eventually found by the mother , but there is no baby in sight . Very strong emotions , all conveyed without a single word . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Time , \" by Michiru Morikawa , we see some of the ' Hope ' as a small boy gives up his chance of getting the latest gadget to donate his savings to the quake appeal . David Leach 's \" Psycho Gran vs . Big T. \" seems to have jumped straight from the pages of Viz , as the Granny of the title battles a Godzilla-esque baddie , seemingly without any connection to the events of March 11th . <p> Spirit of Hope by Chris Weston <p> The stories are filled with mythical legends of the destructors and Superheroes doing their bit to save the day , but it 's the strips with real-life heroes that really make the anthology -- The Dad saving his son in Jason Cobley and Andrew Wildman 's \" Rumble \" or one dog saving another in \" Courage \" by Leonie O'Moore . Having all of the various tales broken up by the occasional single page painting or illustration is a really nice touch too , giving you a pause to reflect on what you 've just read or seen in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course , donating to worthy causes is always a very good thing to do , but it 's even better when you get something more tangible than a glowing sense of goodwill back , so please head over to the Comic Book Alliance and order your copy now .

The finding is reported in this week 's issue of the journal Science . While conservation measures such as putting sharks in the seas may prove unpopular to say the least , the researchers say re-introducing some decimated top predators to nature may be the only way to undo a host of unwanted consequences that have already come back to bite us . Such measures , they add , require the restoration of large tracts to nature rather than piecemeal approaches . \" These animals roam over large areas , \" said James Estes , a marine ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , and lead author of the study . \" You ca n't restore large ' apex consumers ' on an acre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for animals at the top of the food web . The study looked at research results from a wide range of land , freshwater and marine ecosystems and concluded \" the loss of apex consumers is arguably humankind 's most pervasive influence on the natural world . \" Large animals were once ubiquitous across the globe , Estes said . They shaped the structure and dynamics of ecosystems . Their decline , largely caused by humans through hunting and habitat fragmentation , has far-reaching and often surprising consequences , the study found . These include changes in vegetation , wildfire frequency , infectious diseases , invasive species , water quality and nutrient cycles . Plummeting numbers of \" apex consumers \" are most pronounced among the big predators , the researchers said . These animals include as wolves on land , sharks in the oceans , and large fish in freshwater ecosystems . There also are dramatic declines in populations of many large plant eaters , such as elephants and bison . The loss of apex consumers from an ecosystem triggers an ecological phenomenon known as a \" trophic cascade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the food chain . The research \" highlights the unanticipated effects of trophic cascades on Earth systems , including far-reaching processes such as biogeochemical cycles , \" said David Garrison , director of the Biological Oceanography Program at the U.S. National Science Foundation , which helped fund the project . \" The removal of predators like sharks and sea otters , bass and wolves has consequences , \" he added , \" not only for these species , but for all of us . \" \" The top-down effects of apex consumers in an ecosystem are fundamentally important , but it is a complicated phenomenon , \" Estes said . \" They have diverse and powerful effects on the ways ecosystems work , and the loss of these large animals has widespread implications . \" Among the examples Estes and co-authors cite : The extirpation of wolves in Yellowstone National Park led to over-browsing of aspen and willows by elk ; restoration of wolves allowed the vegetation to recover . Dramatic changes in coastal ecosystems followed the collapse and recovery of sea otter populations . Sea otters maintain coastal kelp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decimation of sharks in an estuarine ecosystem caused an outbreak of cow-nosed rays and the collapse of shellfish populations . Despite these and other well-known examples , the extent to which such interactions shape ecosystems was not widely appreciated , scientists say . \" There 's been a tendency to see it as idiosyncratic and specific to particular species and ecosystems , \" Estes said . One reason for this is the top-down effects of apex predators are difficult to observe and study . \" These interactions are invisible unless there is some perturbation that reveals them , \" Estes said . \" With these large animals , it 's impossible to do the kinds of experiments that would be needed to show their effects , so the evidence has been acquired as a result of natural changes and long-term records . \" The study 's findings have profound implications for conservation , he added . \" To the extent that conservation aims to restore functional ecosystems , the reestablishment of large animals and their ecological effects is fundamental , \" Estes said . \" This has huge implications for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to require large-scale approaches . \" ",

        "title":"US Women's Soccer and the Problem of American Exceptionalism\n",
        "text":"<h> U.S. Women 's Soccer and the Problem of American Exceptionalism <p> As I write this article a few hours after the U.S. Women 's Soccer team beat France in the World Cup semifinals , I know that if they lose in the finals , the American excitement toward soccer will wane once again . To be perfectly honest , soccer in our country will continue to be considered a boring , low-scoring game that rarely generates interest or excitement among American sports fans . <p> But , for now , U.S. Soccer -- nay , U.S. Women 's Soccer -- is the talk of the town . Some have argued that it 's the talk of the town by default , because all the other sports are involved in contentious labor disputes ; and baseball , well , September is still far away . Others contend that they have become the darlings of our country because of their flair for the dramatic and the thrill of their quarterfinal victory over Brazil . While these factors have contributed to the sudden popularity of soccer in the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the country is captivated by these women , and it serves as an important reminder to us about our priorities and goals in life . <p> We Americans have this obsessive need to be the best at whatever we do . We are the most powerful country in the world , and we never miss an opportunity to remind others of our superiority . Our culture and politics are based on \" American Exceptionalism , \" which means that we believe that we are better than everyone else . Therefore , if there is an activity or program that we are n't the best at , we tend to quickly rationalize and explain that our deficiency should not be confused with our inadequacy . \" Who needs soccer , \" we say to the rest of the world . It 's not that important to us . We play football , a real man 's sport . <p> However , in our heart of hearts , we know the reality -- that soccer is the world 's sport . And we really want to be the best at soccer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not a championship-caliber team quite yet . We get excited when they win a couple of games , but we do n't expect anything more than that . With the Women 's Soccer team , though , there is a different feeling in the air . We really believe that they can win and that they can be the best . We , therefore , do n't feel ashamed or timid to cheer and brag about our Women 's Soccer team to the rest of the world . We jump on the bandwagon with great enthusiasm . <p> I believe this tendency to jump on the bandwagon when our national team is enjoying success is representative of the American sports culture . We are n't interested in mere competition ; the thrill of participation is not satisfying enough . What matters is that we win -- not just one game , but everything . Indeed , after the U.S. Women 's thrilling victory against Brazil , the sportswriters were questioning the team 's ability to regroup and refocus , and predicted that if they do n't win the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Amy Wambach in extra time . <p> Our collective attitude toward tennis , golf and the Olympics are illustrative of this cultural phenomenon . In years past , when the top tennis players were American , like Connors and McEnroe , tennis boomed in this country . More recently , with no transcendent American star , interest has waned . The same is true in golf . Now that Tiger Woods is no longer dominant , golf is not as big a draw as it was just a few years ago . Similarly , ratings are routinely higher for the Summer Olympics , where the Americans usually win the medal count , compared to the winter games in which we are constantly bested by other countries . <p> We American 's revere the great football coach Vince Lombardi , who famously said , \" winning is n't everything , it 's the only thing . \" But is this credo something we really want to live by ? When we teach our children to play sports , we stress the thrill and value of competition , not winning . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lose , but how you play the game . \" <p> Unfortunately , that ideal is often forgotten once we actually begin to compete . By and large , American culture no longer believes that maxim . Instead , we have become a nation wedded to the concept that \" winning is the only thing . \" How sad . We have lost the joy that comes from challenging ourselves to compete , and from knowing that we have given our best effort , even if we did n't win . <p> The unhealthy emphasis placed on winning in our society , conflicts with one of the basic precepts of Judaism , which values the journey toward perfection and recognizes that true perfection is only found in God . This idea is evidenced by the biblical commandment that every Jew study the Bible . It does n't matter whether he or she will become a scholar , rabbi , businessperson or mailman . From the Jewish perspective , the pursuit of knowledge is far more important and commendable than being the best or most knowledgeable . Every person is obligated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew he can be , even if he never achieves renown or greatness . <p> So while we revel in the achievement of the Women 's Soccer team ( for now ) , we should learn to appreciate athletes who give their all and compete to the best of their ability , even when they fall short of their goals and our national dreams . Win or lose , good or bad , we would be wise to show the same excitement and zeal when we observe valiant competitors in any walk of life , striving for excellence , so that our children will learn to appreciate the thrill and joy of competition . That 's the true American spirit . ",

        "text":"<p> Sue Thoms Press photoThe study participants took 5 grams of fish oil a day in capsules at breakfast and dinner . <p> For several weeks , 48 men with prostate cancer had meals cooked by a chef and delivered to their homes to test the effect of diet on cancer . The result : Those who ate a low-fat diet and took fish-oil supplements had slower cancer cell growth than the men who ate a traditional , high-fat Western diet . <p> \" You truly are what you eat , \" said Dr. William Aronson , a clinical professor of urology at UCLA 's Johnsson Comprehensive Cancer Center . \" We are extremely pleased about our findings , which suggest that by altering the diet , we may favorably affect the biology of prostate cancer . \" <p> He says he 's not ready to make dietary recommendations based on the study just yet : He wants to run a longer-term study with more participants . But the results so far are encouraging , he said . <p> The National Cancer Institutes predict more than 240,000 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease will cause nearly 34,000 deaths . <p> The UCLA study tested the effect of diet on men for four to six weeks before they had their prostates removed . In addition to finding slower cancer-cell growth , the researchers saw a change in the composition of cell membranes in healthy cells and cancer cells in men on the low-fat , fish-oil supplement diet . <p> The cells had higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil and lower levels of omega-6 fatty acids from corn oil . Aronson said that could directly affect the cells ' biology , although he said more study was needed . <p> When researchers studied blood from the patients in test tubes , the blood from those on the low-fat diet slowed the growth of cancer cells .

        "text":"<h> First-ever nationwide test of Emergency Alert System set for Wednesday <p> By Mike M. Ahlers , CNN <p> Updated 6:29 PM ET , Tue November 8 , 2011 <h> Story highlights <p> All previous tests of the network have been local or regional , and optional <p> Wednesday 's test will include a live \" presidential \" alert code , giving it priority <p> People who can not hear their cable TV 's sound will not know it is only a test <p> \" This is a test . This is only a test . \" <p> When millions of Americans hear that warning at 2 p.m . ET Wednesday , the words will sound familiar , but the occasion will be historic . It will mark the first-ever nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System , a system with Cold War roots that enables the president to address the American public within 10 minutes from any location at any time . <p> Although state and local communities regularly use the system to notify communities about tornadoes , child abductions and other events , all previous tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve the voluntary compliance of broadcasters . Wednesday 's test is the first national test featuring a live \" presidential \" alert code , which instructs TV and radio stations that the alert takes priority over all other programming . <p> \" I think the biggest reason nobody ever tested it was because of all the concerns of what could happen and what could go wrong , \" Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Craig Fugate told CNN Tuesday . \" We take a different approach . If we do n't test it , we do n't know what we need to fix . \" <p> Officials at FEMA and at the Federal Communications Commission , which ordered the test , expect things to go smoothly . <p> But there are concerns . Chief among them : cable television systems are worried the test will unduly alarm deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers . That is because some cable systems , unlike broadcast and satellite TV , can not superimpose a visual warning saying \" This is a test \" over the government 's graphic . Instead , they will see only this scrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" which gives no visual indication it is just a test . <p> Some critics also said the test is a stark reminder that -- 10 years after the September 11 terrorist attacks -- the nation is still living with an antiquated warning system in a digital world . <p> The test will air on every broadcast , cable and satellite TV station in the nation , as well as every AM , FM and satellite radio station . But it will not be sent to landline or cell phones , pagers or computers , which millions of people monitor for news and information . <p> The country has made strides in developing an integrated warning system featuring mobile devices , but for most Americans , those systems are years away . <p> And some experts question whether the warning system has much value at the national level . <p> In a local emergency such as a gas leak , emergency management expert Art Botterell notes , the system enables authorities to tell the homeowners to stay inside or to evacuate . \" But if the message is nationwide , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> The system was not used during the September 11 terrorist attack , Botterell noted . But it remains , at a national level , a symbol of the president 's authority and responsibility , he said . <p> \" I think the bottom line is everybody prays to God that we do n't have to use it , because if we do , whether it works or not will probably be the least of everybody 's worries . \" <p> Blink and you 'll miss it <p> The test will be brief -- 30 seconds from start to finish . <p> In the event of a real emergency , the test would originate from wherever the president is . For test purposes , it will originate from a FEMA operations center . The president will not be involved and will not speak . <p> But to duplicate real-world conditions , FEMA will initiate the test by sending a \" live \" presidential alert code , a code that would be used in an actual emergency , to a number of radio stations known as Primary Entry Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information in a daisy chain fashion to other radio and television stations . <p> When a station receives the alert , it must discontinue normal programming and make its transmission lines available for the presidential message . <p> Under the Emergency Alert System agreement , participating stations agree to carry the message , but they have the option of signing off the air . <p> In some systems , the presidential alert automatically interrupts programming ; at other stations , a switch is made manually . <p> At the end of the message , a termination signal is sent to stations allowing them to return to normal programming . <p> After Wednesday 's test , stations must report the results to the FCC within 45 days . The FCC says it will not release test data to the public , saying broadcasters worry that potentially embarrassing results could discourage participation in future tests , and test data could reveal security vulnerabilities . <p> Concerns about confusion <p> Not everyone says the system is ready for a test . <p> Three weeks ago , the National Cable and Telecommunications Association asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of cable households will not see an on-screen message that ' this is a test . ' \" <p> Instead , the on-screen text will simply state : \" This is an Emergency Action Notification , \" and in some cases , \" for the United States \" or \" for the District of Columbia \" depending upon the equipment . <p> \" This raises the possibility that some viewers , particularly the deaf and hard-of-hearing , could mistakenly believe that the test is an actual national emergency , \" NCTA President Michael Powell wrote . <p> Broadcasters and satellite TV providers may be able to superimpose a message that a \" test \" is being conducted , Powell wrote , but cable distributors generally do not have such equipment in place . <p> \" The most prudent course would be to postpone the national test until better functionality exists in the EAS system to visually indicate that it is a test , \" Powell wrote . <p> The FCC responded by limiting the duration of the test to 30 seconds to \" reduce any potential disruptions \" and minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEMA also started a public outreach campaign to notify the hearing impaired , senior citizens , people with mental health issues and people with limited English skills . <p> But reducing the length of the test means one feature of the system can not be tested . <p> \" Under the rules , the president can interrupt ( a broadcast ) and speak as long as they want , \" Botterell said . \" But in the case of other ( non-presidential ) messages , there is a two-minute limit . \" So there is \" lurking fear \" that some equipment may be programmed to cut off emergency alerts after two minutes , he said . <p> Reducing the test to 30 seconds will mean those systems will not be detected , although they are believed to be few and far between , he said . <p> Establishing a benchmark <p> The FCC says the test will establish a benchmark against which future progress can be measured . <p> \" It 's a benchmark that should have been done over a decade ago , \" said Richard Rudman , vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> \" We need to shake out some of the distribution points to see what works and what does n't , \" Rudman said . \" I do not believe it is going to cause panic in the streets . \" <p> He said problems could have been avoided if the FCC had required equipment upgrades sooner . \" We 've known about this for over a decade , \" he said . <p> Experts say the Emergency Alert System being tested Wednesday is unlike the system that Americans will someday use , which will allow messages to be transmitted through TVs , radios , mobile phones , pagers and other means . But change has come slowly , some say . <p> \" We 've been nine months away from the ( integrated system ) for about five years now , \" Botterell said . \" It has slipped continually . \" <p> But FEMA 's Fugate is optimistic . <p> Tests are already being conducted in New York City of devices that receive emergency alerts , and they will become more commonplace as new technology replaces the old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the next year and in other locations , it may be another year or two .

        "text":"<h> Related <p> Hating Twilight is so 2009 , and with the newest installment , Breaking Dawn , ruling the box office , the juggernaut hardly needs defenders . But the virulent seriousness of the haters is surprising . Many of the reviews have heaped disproportionate and moralizing scorn on an Oscar-winning director 's fantasy enactment of a young girl 's dreams and fears . Kristen Stewart and her co-stars have been excoriated for their \" sullen \" and \" wooden \" performances despite receiving respectable and sometimes highly favorable reviews in other movies in which they have starred . <p> The negative reactions fall in two camps : The dismissive camp simply mocks Twilight 's incorporation of silly , \" moony \" elements like undying love and the surprisingly authentic portrayal of wedding ritual , honeymoon jitters and the shock of unintended pregnancy ; the topics are apparently too boring and unrelatable for most reviewers . The deluded camp , conversely , takes Twilight far too seriously , faulting it for leading young girls to mistake fantasy for reality in dangerous , disempowering ways . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of millions of females , like their male counterparts , enjoy their fantasy life straight-up weird , sexy , and implausible . <p> Why is it that female fantasies are such a source of derision and fear ? The male species is allowed all manner of violent , creepy , ludicrous and degrading movie tropes , and while we may not embrace them as high art , no one questions them seriously as entertainment , even when sometimes we probably should . ( Violent imagery is , after all , associated with violent behavior . ) You want to saw someone in half or put their head in a vise ? Showcase naked strippers as a fake plot device ? Pair a beautiful and successful career woman with a slovenly , unemployed man ? Pretend you are Wolverine ? Go right ahead . We know you ca n't really be serious . But watch a tender wedding night between a virginal , undead superhero and his teenage , human bride , and the scolds come out in force . Are parents worried that their teenage daughter actually wants to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands ( and perform an emergency C-section with his teeth ) ? <p> Maybe part of the reason critics deplore these movies is not only because they are so unfamiliar with kooky heterosexual female fantasies but also because they do n't really like what these fantasies say about men . <p> The discomfiting reality of the Twilight phenomenon is the way it strips off the veneer of d ? tente between the sexes . For all the progress we promised our daughters , women 's bodily experiences mark them in ways not only unimaginable , but also uninteresting and even repulsive , to men . When was the last time ( or only time ) you saw a movie that featured menstruation ? ( The Runaways , directed by ... a woman . ) <p> Most mothers know the sense of their body being taken over by aliens , and more than 500,000 women still die in childbirth every year worldwide . Is it really so surprising that we would be drawn to Bella 's gruesome tribulations ? For all its tremendous ick factor and craziness , the vampire-hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward 's bloodied face ) that attends a birth when things go badly wrong . You could hear a pin drop at the screening my daughter and I attended . The gothic horror felt more palpable because it merely exaggerated , rather than imagined sui generis , what many women go through every day . We sure know blood . <p> The other thing women know all too well is the lurking danger of men . The idea of a wildly earnest romantic lead who is n't demanding oral sex in the high school parking lot ( and who happens to look like Robert Pattinson ) is all very appealing , no ? Yet our perfect vampire man , alas , also has the capacity to inflict serious harm -- much like in the non-cinematic world , as even 5-year-old girls can intuit . <p> You do n't have to read Steven Pinker 's fine new book on violence , The Better Angels of our Nature , to grasp that women have always been its singular victims . The devastating power of rape , which results in pregnancy 5% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology , is its ability to \" change the progeny \" of a woman forever . This threat often clouds our real lives and it certainly clouds our confused notions of entertainment . Is it any wonder that the young man whose heart Bella tosses aside for Edward is , you guessed it , a wolf ? As one of my jaded neighbors once opined , \" All men is half dog . \" <p> If this offends you , take a number . Women have long endured men 's insulting and unhinged fantasies . Just lie back and enjoy the estrogen drip . ",

( the runaways , directed by ... a woman . ) <p> most mothers know the sense of their body being taken over by aliens , and more than 500,000 women still die in childbirth every year worldwide . is it really so surprising that we would be drawn to bella 's gruesome tribulations ? for all its tremendous ick factor and craziness , the vampire-hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edward 's bloodied face ) that attends a birth when things go badly wrong . you could hear a pin drop at the screening my daughter and i attended . the gothic horror felt more palpable because it merely exaggerated , rather than imagined sui generis , what many women go through every day . we sure know blood . <p> the other thing women know all too well is the lurking danger of men . the idea of a wildly earnest romantic lead who is n't demanding oral sex in the high school parking lot ( and who happens to look like robert pattinson ) is all very appealing , no ? yet our perfect vampire man , alas , also has the capacity to inflict serious harm -- much like in the non-cinematic world , as even 5-year-old girls can intuit . <p> you do n't have to read steven pinker 's fine new book on violence , the better angels of our nature , to grasp that women have always been its singular victims . the devastating power of rape , which results in pregnancy 5% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal of obstetrics and gynecology , is its ability to \" change the progeny \" of a woman forever . this threat often clouds our real lives and it certainly clouds our confused notions of entertainment . is it any wonder that the young man whose heart bella tosses aside for edward is , you guessed it , a wolf ? as one of my jaded neighbors once opined , \" all men is half dog . \" <p> if this offends you , take a number . women have long endured men 's insulting and unhinged fantasies . just lie back and enjoy the estrogen drip .

        "text":"<h> The New Challenge of Leading Financial Firms <p> Running a financial organization , never easy to begin with , has quickly become one of the most difficult leadership challenges that an executive can undertake , requiring mastery of talent management , change management , and ethics . An interview with Professor Boris Groysberg , who teaches a new HBS Executive Education program on the subject with Professor Paul M. Healy . Key concepts include : <p> Leading a financial firm is very different from leading any other kind of institution , requiring deep skills in a multitude of areas . <p> Financial firms make expensive bets on top talent , but often make hiring decisions without enough deliberation . <p> Risk management , strategy for growth , and competing in emerging markets are especially critical for financial firms to get right . <p> Running a financial institution , never easy to begin with , has quickly become one of the most difficult leadership challenges that an executive can undertake , requiring mastery of talent management , change management , and ethics . <p> \" The business today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" -- Paul M. Healy <p> \" The business today is much more complex than ten or twenty years ago , \" said Harvard Business School Professor Paul M. Healy in a recent interview . \" The firms in the business have much more complexity in the types of the risks they are managing , in the types of diversity of the businesses they are in , in terms of how global they are . \" <p> Realizing that the headaches and rewards of these leaders are somewhat singular to their field , Healy and colleague Boris Groysberg have created an HBS Executive Education program called Leadership in Financial Organizations . Combining a mix of case studies , lectures , and interactive exercises , the program is designed for high-level managers or executives at banks , insurance companies , asset management or private equity firms , or hedge funds . Groysberg and Healy will teach the program in England , in India , in China , and on the HBS Boston campus throughout 2012 and 2013 . <p> \" Leading a financial institution is very different from leading any other kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a leader in a manufacturing company , for example , all you 're basically going to have to do is manage . When you become a leader in a major financial institution , you must do several major things and do them really well . If you 're a trader , for example , you have to trade , you have to lead , and you have to manage . You have three jobs . \" <p> One way leadership of a financial firm differs from others is in the emphasis that must be placed in recruiting and retaining talent . <p> \" It always fascinates me how an investment banker who has spent months and months and months analyzing a particular deal between two companies can spend only a few minutes making a hiring decision for his team , when the firm is sometimes paying millions of dollars in guaranteed compensation , \" Groysberg says . <h> Hiring And Managing <p> Talent acquisition , development , and retention is a key topic for financial firms that Groysberg raises in his new book , Chasing Stars : the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one firm to another . Too often , managers fail to consider that a top performer 's success may have been due in large part to the culture of the previous organization ; hence , the type of person who thrived at Goldman Sachs might flounder at Credit Suisse . <p> But there 's a broader reason for performance declines : banks often do n't spend much time on training and development , a symptom of a general culture of impatience in the financial world . <p> \" Hiring is not an event . It 's a process \" -- Boris Groysberg <p> \" Hiring is not an event , \" Groysberg says . \" It 's a process . When that person arrives Monday at eight o'clock , it 's just the beginning , but companies often spend zero time in integrating talented people . It used to be that we 'd let people take some time to learn the culture of a new organization , but it 's not like that anymore . Our expectations are immediate : ' We 've paid you a lot of money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing something useful yet ? ' If the twentieth century was a learning century , then the twenty-first century is a performance century . \" <p> In considering whether job performance is a matter of each person 's innate natural ability or a matter of how well a company trains its new employees , CEOs often place too much weight on the former , Groysberg argues . \" Even the best and the brightest can benefit from a nurturing environment , \" he says . \" You can turn a talented person into a superstar if you combine nature and nurture . \" <p> That said , he adds , in the program there will be much discussion on compensation : short term versus long term , fixed versus variable , and how to disperse compensation fairly among the firm . <h> Growth Strategies , Risk Management , And Globalization <p> Other issues of importance to the leader of modern-day financial organizations to be discussed in the program include : <p> Growth strategy . One key question financial leaders must decide is whether it is better to grow the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would be surprised by the batting averages of most institutions , \" Groysberg says . \" So , so many acquisitions are not successful . \" <p> Risk management . Even a cursory reading of recent headlines shows how vulnerable financial firms can be in this interrelated world , making risk management strategies crucial to success . \" We 'll spend time talking about leading through crises and about what we have learned from recent events , \" Groysberg says . \" We 'll look at how we can deal with it if we have to go through another crisis . Considering what 's happening in Europe , it 's a good time to start doing that . \" <p> Globalization . Financial leaders must realize the increasing importance of doing business not only in New York , London , and Tokyo , but in the emerging markets of India , China , and Brazil as well . \" I think many companies are realizing that their track record of going outside their home country is n't great , because , to be completely honest , not that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who works in London , for instance , to attend our program in Mumbai . It will let them be in a different environment and build different relationships . \" <h> About the Author <p> Carmen Nobel is the senior editor of HBS Working Knowledge . <h> Post A Comment <p> Chirag Swamy <p> Manager Pre-Sales , Animika Studios <p> I believe that one of the biggest challenges that Financial institutions face today is a ' trust deficit ' . A leader should ideally look at regaining public confidence for his firm and this can be achieved through concentrated , innovative marketing and advertising efforts . The bad PR that they have constantly been subjected to since 2008 needs to be reversed at the earliest . <p> Zulkani SAHIN <p> after sale manager , PSA Peugeot Citoren <p> I think that a very important factor among many is to obtain a cohesion from peers to indicate them the direction to take ( vision , goal ) . What makes the difference is the way how people in an organization have been involved and felt essantial in the strategy will create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult situation . <p> Anonymous <p> Leaders have to fight in many fronts . To cite a few : Financial services are becoming complex and more regulated . Integration of major economies is adding exchange risk considerably . Provison requirements are increasing due to International Banking norms . <p> Anonymous <p> Indeed , modern financial institutions have become impatient organisations and the industry 's employment practices are clear evidence of this impatience as mentioned in your article . <p> Perhaps the fast-moving and ever-demanding environment of financial markets have influenced the industry through time . In your view , what is your thought on solving the imbalance between expectation and results ( that may be the cause of impatience ) in the industry ? <p> Anonymous <p> I agree that hiring and staff development is a critical process in financial organisations . A close analysis really confirms that the difference between firms is not so much its assets but its staff . <p> Ravi Parsi <p> Director , Kantech Engineers Pvt . Ltd . <p> The present is very complicated world with greater integration of cultures , different styles of managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cross hairs of everybody in the management of organisations especially for financial firms and future will become even more complicated . <p> So the need for financial firm is more to depend upon to do what it knows to do and encourage the leaders &amp; their teams to stick to there own knitting . This will mean sometime your quarterly numbers will not be what the stock market wants ! ! ! <p> This is the very great challenge in managing financial organisation to remove the focus from quarterly numbers to its main reason for existing in the financial world . <p> The complicated world will throw up newer ways of doing looking very attractive to make money in a difficult world . The challenge here is not to pressure the teams to take un-calculated risks without understanding the nature to new ways of doing . This is again possible if the focus is not on Joneses making spectacular quarterly numbers by employing to newer ways of doing but to support &amp; encourage the team to learn and consider risks before taking the plunge and supporting them if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed ! ! ! ! <p> shantha <p> Director\/Lecturer , Agape International <p> One of the greatest challenges is the management of emerging risks in a new business paradigm . Some financial institutions , especially in emerging economies , still consider traditional borrowing and lending as their business . For example , identity fraud and hacking have become major risk factors and thus our risk models should also change accordingly . Large investments in \" managing new risks \" is likely to increase the cost to income ration further . <p> Suhas Bindu <p> Consultant , NA <p> In my opinion , the most important challenge is to prioritize and focus on the business objectives.As a matter of fact , the firms must stay away from the greed of the business and lucrative opportunties without proper exercize . Working on too many fronts in the financial world of random behaviour could hit the firm at a later stage <p> Johanna Lubahn <p> Managing Director , Cohen Brown Management Group <p> I agree with the complexity of managing and leading financial institutions as I work globally in this industry . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all areas and fast tracking changes that need to be implemented . Not easy when at the top of the structure but doable as evidenced by some CEO 's who understand the power of their people , know how to engage them and motivate them around the vision <p> Kapil Kumar Sopory <p> Company Secretary , SMEC(India) Private Limited <p> The level of responsibility cast on financial companies is very high as they deal directly with the money of their customers . They have to possess exemplary acumen to ensure their acceptability by acting cleanly . Their misdemeanours come to the fore fast and they can not live through dubious means for long . Responsibility is also cast on them on choosing right borrowers who have got to repay come what may . We need performing assets only and bad debts would come as sharp killers . This holds generally for other organisations too but since a financial firm - a bank for instance - lends its depositors ' money , it is to be ensured that the deposits are not frittered away for these have u8ltimately to be repayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anonymous <p> The industry has not been lead too fully understand the \" threat \" of its competition and with insufficient \" risk management \" processes . Before we can \" fix \" it the hard truth about the situation needs to be understood and told . We must return to the basics and teach this next generation the true valule of how to evelate and underwrite risk . <p> Regular Simulation of Stress Testing ( based on very well defined and tough parameters taking care of risk aspects ) by any financial institution especially when the global scenario turns merkier is most important . With sudden change in the external environment and incumbent impact becomes capable of spoiling fortune of any robust financial compainy . Secod comes ' value systems ' which is inculcated by the Leader of the organisation . If both these aspects are there all other becomes subsidiary and could be retrofitted automatically . In developing economies like India if banks could survive the onslaught of 2008 global melt down it is only beause strong prudential norms and compliance . Many privately financial companies meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is exacerbated equally by greedy clients looking forward astronomical higher returns not possible under given economic conditions ..

We checked a Facebook Post that charged that members of Congress are disproportionately wealthy . <p> Over the past two months , the Occupy Wall Street movement has spread to cities around the country , and those other movements are busy putting out messages that protest against income inequality . <p> A reader recently sent us an example from Facebook , which was an online message credited to Occupy D.C. The posting says : <p> \" 1 percent of Americans are millionaires . \" <p> \" 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires . \" <p> \" 56 percent of Senators are millionaires . \" <p> \" What would the country be like if our representative government was actually representative ? \" <p> The reader asked us to check it out , and we were curious ourselves if the division of wealth between the country as a whole and our elected leaders was quite that stark . So we decided to unpack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts . <p> \" 1 percent of Americans are millionaires . \" <p> A millionaire is a person whose net worth is $1 million or more . Net worth is cash , home value , stocks , bonds and other property minus any debts owed . <p> The Federal Reserve Board conducts a Survey of Consumer Finances every three years . Its last survey was in 2007 , with an update in 2009 . The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute analyzed that data and determined that the average wealth of the top 1 percent was close to $14 million in 2009 , down from $19.2 million in 2007 ( in part because of a decline in housing values ) . Still , many in the top 1 percent clearly were multimillionaires . <p> A 2011 study by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services estimated there are around 10.5 million households in the U.S. in 2011 with net worth of more than $1 million . <p> That 's around 9 percent of all households , which is far larger than 1 percent . <p> If you measure how many individuals have incomes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the mark . <p> The Internal Revenue Service recently released income statistics for 2009 . It found the top 1 percent of the country included people who made adjusted gross income $343,927 and up . But adjusted gross income can leave out some types of income , particularly types of income not subject to tax . <p> For a fuller pictures , we turned to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center . It created an economic analysis of total cash income for 2011 , not just taxable or adjusted income . The center found that the top 1 percent in 2011 had an average income of $1.5 million a year . However , some elites made slightly less the a million . The least wealthy of the top 1 percent had cash income of $532,613 . <p> Interesting , but income only does n't define millionaires . <p> \" 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires . 56 percent of Senators are millionaires . \" <p> Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate are paid $174,000 annually , with leadership positions paid slightly more . But many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial net worth . <p> Members of the House and Senate are required to file financial disclosures that include their assets and liabilities , and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics compiles those disclosures . <p> The representatives and senators are not required to disclose precisely how much they are worth , but they do have to indicate a range of amounts for their assets and liabilities . The center calculates the midpoint between these high and low estimates , then uses that midpoint to rank-order lawmakers from richest to least rich . <p> According to the center 's most recent analysis , 183 members of the House had a midpoint net worth estimate of at least $1 million . Meanwhile , the center calculated that 67 senators had a midpoint net worth estimate of $1 million or higher . These numbers were for the calendar year 2010 . <p> The wealthiest member of Congress was Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , the head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . \" Issa 's minimum estimated net worth in 2010 was $195 million , while his maximum estimated net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in its analysis . The midpoint estimate in that range is $448 million . <p> Rep. Alcee Hastings , D-Fla. , is the least wealthy member of Congress . Hastings ' liabilities exceed his assets ; the center reported that his minimum estimated net worth is negative $7.3 million while his maximum estimated net worth is negative $2.1 million . <p> The median net worth of House members was an estimated $756,765 , while the median net worth of a senator was $2.63 million . <p> So , using these estimates -- and remember , these are only estimates -- 42 percent of House members are millionaires , while 67 percent of senators are millionaires . <p> Our ruling <p> The Facebook posting from Occupy D.C. said , \" 1 percent of Americans are millionaires . 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires . 56 percent of Senators are millionaires . \" One recent study found that around 9 percent of all U.S. households have net assets of more than $1 million . So the claim on Facebook significantly understates the wealth of individuals . <p> It 's closer if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans has an average income of $1.5 million . But the relevant figure would be net worth . <p> As for members of Congress , the most recent estimate shows that 42 percent of House members and 67 percent of senators are millionaires in net worth . That means the Facebook post is a bit high in its estimate of House millionaires and a bit low in its estimate of Senate millionaires . <p> The numbers support the underlying point of the Facebook post -- that members of Congress are disproportionately wealthy . But not on the scale suggested . We rate the Facebook post Half True . ",

        "text":"<h> Addressing Fashion 's Communications Conundrum <p> NEW YORK , United States -- In recent years , the main fashion weeks in New York , London , Milan and Paris have attracted unprecedented interest from end consumers , with brands live streaming their shows and bloggers reporting from the runway in realtime on their sites and social channels like Twitter and Instagram . But in most cases , the actual clothes showcased during fashion week are n't available to consumers until many months after the shows have finished . <p> In short , fashion 's communication cycle has become wildly out of sync with its retail cycle . Would the film industry ever hold a movie premiere 6 months ahead of its release to the public ? Would Apple make its buzzy product announcements a half-year before said products were available for sale ? <p> By shortening lead times , planning production in advance , and using other lean manufacturing techniques , fashion brands may be able to get product to consumers more quickly . But these kinds of structural changes could take years to implement , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . <p> One solution has been to let consumers order -- but not receive -- products immediately after the shows . Mega-brands like Burberry have offered pre-ordering for several seasons now , while a number of mid-sized and emerging brands have collaborated with ' pre-tail ' trunk-show start-up Moda Operandi to do the same . But market reports suggest that the sales volume of pre-orders has been limited . There are only so many consumers who are willing to plonk down money in advance to guarantee they will get a specific garment in their size months later . Most consumers still seem to prefer to purchase in-season , close to the time of need . <p> So if enabling consumers to pre-order clothes is not the ideal solution , why not engage consumers just before the collections arrive in store ? Based on the evidence of blowout events from Victoria 's Secret and H&amp;M for Versace in New York earlier this month , consumer appetite for this kind of engagement , and the impact it has on sales , seem very promising indeed . <p> VICTORIA 'S SECRET 'S GLOBAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite possibly the largest fashion event of its kind . From its humble beginnings in August 1995 , with a budget of only $120,000 , the Victoria 's Secret show has grown into a blockbuster multi-media event , with six different themes , featuring 38 models in 69 different looks , and costing more than $13m this year . <p> \" Our show is seen , in one way or another , in over 200 countries in print , Facebook , YouTube , and television specials , \" explained Ed Razek , Chief Marketing Officer of creative services of Limited Brands ( the parent company of Victoria 's Secret ) as we sat backstage before the first of two tapings of this year 's show . \" It is must-watch television for young women in the United States . They learn to walk in high heels in this show . \" <p> While Mr. Razek explained how Victoria 's Secret has honed the show format over the past 16 years , Kanye West and the assembled Victoria 's Secret models were doing a backstage photo call in a crush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be described as an all out media frenzy . <p> \" Candidly , I think the first show was an aesthetic failure , \" he said . \" We did n't much know what we were doing , except the next day papers all over the world were calling it the lingerie event of the century . We knew that we had an idea . \" <p> Over the years , the production values of the show and the quality of the collection have improved dramatically . Just last year , the brand began working with respected stylist and fashion editor , Sophia Neophitou-Apostolou , who is better known for her work with high-end fashion designers like Roland Mouret and Antonio Berardi . This year , Ms. Neophitou-Apostolou spent more than 40 days working on Victoria 's Secret runway collection , providing her input throughout the creative process . <p> Another parameter that has changed over the years is timing . The first show back in 1995 was held in August . For several years after that , the shows were held in the days preceding Valentine 's Day . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just in time for the holiday season . \" Christmas is the single biggest commercial opportunity of the year and it 's also a great time to do a fashion show special , \" said Mr. Razek . This year 's show was taped on November 9th and will air on November 29th on CBS , one of the three major American broadcast television networks . <p> Interestingly , the Victoria 's Secret show is not broadcast live , which Mr. Razek says comes down to maintaining production values and managing risk . \" You 're on network television in the United States . It is our responsibility to show our girls in their best light , \" he said . \" The reward is n't worth the risk . We want a beautifully produced show ; something that is compelling and interesting . \" In 2004 , the Victoria 's Secret show was cancelled in the wake of the backlash following Janet Jackson 's so-called ' wardrobe malfunction ' during the Superbowl half-time show . <p> But even without a live broadcast , Mr. Razek said : \" You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show you see substantial increases in our web business from all of the news coverage . The day after the fashion show runs on television , you see substantial increases in our web business . \" <p> While he declined to provide any detailed numbers to back this up , Victoria 's Secret Direct , which includes both the online and catalogue businesses , chalked up $1.5 billion in sales in 2010 , roughly one-third of Victoria 's Secret 's overall sales . To provide a sense of scale , this makes Victoria 's Secret Direct about twice the size of Neiman Marcus Direct ( $715 million in revenues in 2010 ) and more than eight times the size of Yoox or Net-a-Porter ( about $200 million in annual sales each ) . <p> But importantly , the Victoria 's Secret show is about more than just driving online sales . It is the cornerstone of an integrated communications strategy that drives brand awareness as well as bolstering revenue across direct retail , catalogue and online channels . <p> Indeed , an integrated communications and sales strategy has long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case study published in 2002 by Tuck Business School at Dartmouth College , when Leslie Wexner bought Victoria 's Secret in 1982 , he sought to make it \" stand out as an integrated world-class brand . Across all channels -- catalogue , stores , Internet -- the same products are launched at the same time , in exactly the same way , with the same quality , and same positioning . \" <p> When asked to compare Victoria 's Secret 's marketing and communications initiatives to those deployed by luxury fashion brands , Mr. Razek offered : \" The obvious difference is that we 're showing fashion in real-time , during the season , things that are accessible in the stores now . They are showing Fall in Spring , Spring in Fall . How does the end customer connect with that , particularly with all of the live-streaming ? \" <p> \" They 're living in the past , \" he concluded . \" There are n't three fashion magazines anymore ... the world is so broad , there are so many opportunities to communicate . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that a substantial portion of the designer community is involved in an exercise of mass collective denial . \" <p> H&amp;M FOR VERSACE INCITES PANDEMONIUM <p> The day before the Victoria 's Secret show , H&amp;M put on its own fashion spectacle in New York to celebrate its latest high-fashion collaboration , this time with Versace . With 500 fashion editors , bloggers and media from all over the world in town to cover the show , and a celebrity red carpet entrance to rival that of a major Hollywood event , this was another striking example of timing integrated brand communications to coincide with the arrival of product in stores . <p> The event began with a fashion show in an elaborate replica of the Versace show space in Milan at Pier 57 , overlooking the Hudson River . When the show concluded , a beaming Donatella Versace unveiled a vast room behind the show space , filled with disco balls and an intimate stage set , where rising hiphop star Nicki Minaj soon took to the stage , decked out in Versace for H&amp;M . Ms. Minaj 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop legend Prince . <p> All the while , anecdotes , photos and videos were being beamed out to the world via the Twitter , Instagram and Facebook accounts of the attendees . When the concert eventually concluded at 15 minutes past midnight , the walls opened up once more to reveal a fully-stocked Versace for H&amp;M pop-up store , which created pandemonium unlike anything I have ever seen , and this , even amongst the fashion elite who have access to almost any kind of fashion they want . <p> As we waited in the crush to enter the store , someone asked American Vogue 's Hamish Bowles why he was subjecting himself to this kind of mob . \" It 's all a part of the experience , \" he said , gesturing towards the shoppers stripping the mannequins bare , just behind a thick layer of burly security guards who were doing their best to hold back the throng . \" Please stand back , \" they repeated . \" There is plenty of stuff for everyone . \" <p> As it turned out , the security guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes as the first wave of shoppers snapped up everything in sight , filling four or five or six bags each with clothes . It was not a luxury shopping experience , that 's for sure , and the huge demand was in no small part due to prices which started at $17.95 for a pair of men 's printed underwear . But the collaboration could n't have come at a better time for Versace . It put a short , sharp spotlight on the once-struggling brand which is also having a bit of a fashion renaissance . East London creatives have been scouring vintage stores over the past couple of years to find vibrant Versace prints from the brand 's heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s , when Versace was still at the head of the fashion vanguard . <p> \" It is about bringing Versace to a whole new generation , and showing them the true essence of the house , \" Donatella Versace told BoF . \" Versace is already interacting with them in other ways . We are very active on Twitter and other social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the collaboration with H&amp;M has allowed us to connect with even more people . \" The day after the New York event , the show video was already available online , and a quirky fashion film was also rolled out across the fashion blogosphere . <p> Commenting on the immediate communications formula employed by H&amp;M to promote the collaboration , Ms. Versace said : \" It made me think about how there are too many rules in fashion and how too often we get caught in these rules . I have never felt the need to follow the rules , but the system is so rigid these days with deadlines , so many collections to produce every year . This collaboration with H&amp;M taught me that it was absolutely possible and necessary to break the rules . \" she said . \" I really enjoyed working with a company that felt very strongly that we had to push things further . \" <p> Last week , the collection finally arrived in cities around the world just as the Versace for H&amp;M show buzz was cresting online , selling out almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer demand . <p> LESSONS FOR FASHION BRANDS <p> So , apart from synchronising the timing of brand communications and product delivery , what can a luxury fashion brand learn from these mass consumer fashion events ? <p> Ms. Neophitou-Apostolou said that fashion brands need to learn to dream again . \" It 's about selling the dream , that 's the main thing . Do n't be too literal . Create the fantasy . Do n't be afraid of it , \" she suggested a few days later , at a lunch in honour of Antonio Berardi . \" I think people become so concerned about : ' Is it wearable ; Is it wearable ? ' McQueen in the day was always about fantasy . John Galliano was always about fantasy . Even Azzedine Ala ? a takes you on a journey ; in his little shows he creates his own universe . I think that 's the trick . Do n't be afraid to dream ! \" <p> That said , \" every look in the Victoria 's Secret show has a piece of product so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these were mixed in with dream-like pieces including the now famous angel wings . \" It 's the best piece of marketing I 've ever been involved with , \" she added . <p> Indeed , the consumer events in New York could n't have been more different from fashion shows designed for an industry audience . They must be conceived and designed to have maximum impact on screen , drive online conversation , and ultimately drive sales online and in-store . <p> Even for a behemoth like H&amp;M , this kind of initiative requires a huge investment of time and resources . \" It 's a huge undertaking to organise a fashion show for editors from all 41 markets , \" said Margareta van den Bosch , Creative Director of H&amp;M . <p> What 's more , having an integrated supply chain from design to production to retail , makes it much easier to align the communications and sales cycles . According to the Tuck Business School case , Victoria 's Secret is \" equipped with vertically integrated factories that manufacture and deliver goods directly to the company without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We own all our own stores , \" added Mr Razek . \" There are n't any buyers from department stores sitting in the front row writing orders . Our ultimate customer is not a merchant with a pencil , which is different from most designers . \" ",

set , where rising hiphop star nicki minaj soon took to the stage , decked out in versace for h&amp;m . ms. minaj 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop legend prince . <p> all the while , anecdotes , photos and videos were being beamed out to the world via the twitter , instagram and facebook accounts of the attendees . when the concert eventually concluded at 15 minutes past midnight , the walls opened up once more to reveal a fully-stocked versace for h&amp;m pop-up store , which created pandemonium unlike anything i have ever seen , and this , even amongst the fashion elite who have access to almost any kind of fashion they want . <p> as we waited in the crush to enter the store , someone asked american vogue 's hamish bowles why he was subjecting himself to this kind of mob . \" it 's all a part of the experience , \" he said , gesturing towards the shoppers stripping the mannequins bare , just behind a thick layer of burly security guards who were doing their best to hold back the throng . \" please stand back , \" they repeated . \" there is plenty of stuff for everyone . \" <p> as it turned out , the security guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes as the first wave of shoppers snapped up everything in sight , filling four or five or six bags each with clothes . it was not a luxury shopping experience , that 's for sure , and the huge demand was in no small part due to prices which started at $17.95 for a pair of men 's printed underwear . but the collaboration could n't have come at a better time for versace . it put a short , sharp spotlight on the once-struggling brand which is also having a bit of a fashion renaissance . east london creatives have been scouring vintage stores over the past couple of years to find vibrant versace prints from the brand 's heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s , when versace was still at the head of the fashion vanguard . <p> \" it is about bringing versace to a whole new generation , and showing them the true essence of the house , \" donatella versace told bof . \" versace is already interacting with them in other ways . we are very active on twitter and other social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the collaboration with h&amp;m has allowed us to connect with even more people . \" the day after the new york event , the show video was already available online , and a quirky fashion film was also rolled out across the fashion blogosphere . <p> commenting on the immediate communications formula employed by h&amp;m to promote the collaboration , ms. versace said : \" it made me think about how there are too many rules in fashion and how too often we get caught in these rules . i have never felt the need to follow the rules , but the system is so rigid these days with deadlines , so many collections to produce every year . this collaboration with h&amp;m taught me that it was absolutely possible and necessary to break the rules . \" she said . \" i really enjoyed working with a company that felt very strongly that we had to push things further . \" <p> last week , the collection finally arrived in cities around the world just as the versace for h&amp;m show buzz was cresting online , selling out almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer demand . <p> lessons for fashion brands <p> so , apart from synchronising the timing of brand communications and product delivery , what can a luxury fashion brand learn from these mass consumer fashion events ? <p> ms. neophitou-apostolou said that fashion brands need to learn to dream again . \" it 's about selling the dream , that 's the main thing . do n't be too literal . create the fantasy . do n't be afraid of it , \" she suggested a few days later , at a lunch in honour of antonio berardi . \" i think people become so concerned about : ' is it wearable ; is it wearable ? ' mcqueen in the day was always about fantasy . john galliano was always about fantasy . even azzedine ala ? a takes you on a journey ; in his little shows he creates his own universe . i think that 's the trick . do n't be afraid to dream ! \" <p> that said , \" every look in the victoria 's secret show has a piece of product so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these were mixed in with dream-like pieces including the now famous angel wings . \" it 's the best piece of marketing i 've ever been involved with , \" she added . <p> indeed , the consumer events in new york could n't have been more different from fashion shows designed for an industry audience . they must be conceived and designed to have maximum impact on screen , drive online conversation , and ultimately drive sales online and in-store . <p> even for a behemoth like h&amp;m , this kind of initiative requires a huge investment of time and resources . \" it 's a huge undertaking to organise a fashion show for editors from all 41 markets , \" said margareta van den bosch , creative director of h&amp;m . <p> what 's more , having an integrated supply chain from design to production to retail , makes it much easier to align the communications and sales cycles . according to the tuck business school case , victoria 's secret is \" equipped with vertically integrated factories that manufacture and deliver goods directly to the company without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we own all our own stores , \" added mr razek . \" there are n't any buyers from department stores sitting in the front row writing orders . our ultimate customer is not a merchant with a pencil , which is different from most designers . \" ",

        "text":"<p> By Robert D. KaplanRobert D. Kaplan is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and the author of The Revenge of Geography : What the Map Tells Us About Coming Conflicts and the Battle Against Fate . <p> November 28 , 2011 <p> Fundamentally , the past year has been about grappling with the most profound question in political philosophy : how to create legitimate central authority . In one Arab country after another -- Tunisia , Egypt , Libya , Yemen , Syria -- populations have taken to the streets to demand the downfall of their rulers , even as it is unclear what will follow in their wake . <p> And the question applies not only to the Arab world . It is unclear , for example , whether Iran 's quasi-clerical system of revolutionary rule has a long-term future , given the intense infighting within the regime and the intense dislike it stirs within significant swaths of the population . Can China 's one-party system of control last indefinitely ? Can Burma 's ? Whereas the United States basically inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama over more than two centuries has been about limiting central authority , the challenge in too many other places is the opposite : how to erect responsive government in the first place . <p> No thinker has tackled these questions as painstakingly and as eloquently as the 19th-century English philosopher John Stuart Mill , which is why he is such an appropriate guide for these complicated times . Mill asserts , in On Liberty , and especially in Considerations on Representative Government , that while democratic government is surely to be preferred in theory , it is incredibly problematic in its particulars . This , of course , is part of Mill 's larger exploration of liberty , and why ultimately the only justification a government has to curtail that liberty is when a person 's behavior impinges on the rights of others . Despotism may work better in some instances , if only as a temporary measure , he writes ; democracy is not suited for each and every society during significant periods of its development . I am crudely simplifying Mill , who is so clear while being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" Progress includes Order , \" Mill writes in Considerations , \" but Order does not include Progress . \" Tyranny may be the political building block of all human societies , but if they do n't get beyond tyranny , the result is moral chaos and stagnation . Middle Eastern despots of our day too often supplied only Order ; Asian ones have brought Progress , too . Thus China 's rulers , who must retire at a certain point , who bring technical expertise to their rule , and who govern in a collegial style , are much to be preferred over the North African variety , to say nothing of those in Syria or Yemen . Yet even in those cases , the prospect of a collapse of central authority indicates that , pace Mill , there may be no alternative to some sort of dictatorship , at least in the very short term . <p> Mill 's philosophy actually builds on that of his 17th-century compatriot , Thomas Hobbes , another thinker all too relevant for our times . Hobbes is often regarded as a preacher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stared into the abyss of anarchy and realized there was , indeed , a solution that could lead to order and progress . That solution was the state . Hobbes extols the moral benefits of fear and sees violent anarchy as the chief threat to society . For Hobbes -- best known for observing that the lives of men are \" nasty , brutish , and short \" -- fear of violent death is the cornerstone of enlightened self-interest . By establishing a state , men replace the fear of violent death with the fear that only those who break the law need face . So while Hobbes made the case for central authority , Mill built on him to help us understand how humanity must get beyond mere authority in order to erect a liberal regime . <p> Such concepts are sometimes difficult to grasp for today 's urban middle class , which has long since lost any contact with man 's natural condition . But the horrific violence of a disintegrating Iraq , or this year 's fears of state collapse in places such as Yemen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's original state . In fact , as more and more nondemocratic systems find it harder and harder to survive in this age of instant electronic communications , Mill and Hobbes will top the dead thinkers list for years to come . Iraq , with its mixture of democracy , creeping authoritarianism , and anarchy , is a place made for Mill and Hobbes , while Afghanistan is pure Hobbes . Imagine the relevance of Hobbes in the event of a regime collapse in North Korea ; or of Mill as Egypt struggles for years to transform a military dictatorship into a civil democracy . These men may be long dead , but their philosophy is a sure guide to today 's headlines . The need for order -- even as order must be made free from tyranny -- is precisely the issue that hangs over the Greater Middle East . ",

The multimillion-dollar urban renewal project called for strip mines to contain the fire and then eradicate it . The fire had raged beneath the city 's west side for nearly 15 years in mines owned by the Carbondale Coal Co. , a subsidiary of the Glenn Alden Co . <p> The Carbondale Redevelopment Authority had purchased 80 homes in the vast redevelopment area to make way for the project .

Temperatures in those holes were among the hottest since the project began , burning up to 1,200 degrees - which meant a change in the blasting schedule .

This is now changing , as investors are questioning France 's solvency and demanding higher rates . Germany should strive to prevent even the most remote risk of a French downgrade , which would jeopardize the euro zone 's stability more than sovereign refinancing by the European Central Bank ever could . However , the German government is currently more concerned with its own domestic popularity and internal tensions , blind to the French president 's need for some success during a difficult electoral campaign and -- more regrettably -- blind to the economic and political needs of both the euro zone and the wider European Union . <p> For Germany , the role of the European Central Bank has become a question of principle rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been differences between France and Germany throughout the crisis -- most evident in the disputes over automatic sanctions , economic governance and eurobonds . This is nothing new : it has been the ability to bridge the differences between the two nations that historically characterised the Franco-German tandem as the engine of European integration . However , the current situation is bringing this engine to its limits . While Nicolas Sarkozy 's chances of re-election are waning with the speculation over a downgrade , Angela Merkel risks a revolt within her own party should she agree to any measures that might impose costs on German taxpayers or diverge from German economic dogmatism , especially the mantra of central bank independence . From the beginning of this crisis , the involvement of the European Central Bank has been a sore point for Germany . It has become a question of principle rather than a question of economic reasoning . <p> To outsiders this may be astonishing , considering the ramifications it may have . To cling to economic principles that predate monetary union and the evident market failures of the past years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible fallout of a French downgrade . But to discuss alternatives to Germany 's central banking dogmatism is taboo for Germany 's right , regardless of advice from Nobel laureates and German economists . <p> Merkel is primarily playing to her ( national ) audience , much in the same way that Sarkozy is . This is , in other words , not a stand-off between nations but between schools of thought and political actors , guided by their needs .

        "text":"<h> Tags : <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , this is what a lender of last resort looks like . What you 're looking at here are three lines . The black line is Morgan Stanley 's market capitalization , which tends to hover in the $40 billion range but which fell as low as $9.8 billion in November 2008 . The orange line is the amount that Morgan Stanley owed to the Federal Reserve on any given day -- an amount which peaked at $107 billion on September 29 , 2008 . And the red line is the ratio between the two : Morgan Stanley 's debt to the Federal Reserve , expressed as a percentage of its market value . That ratio , it turns out , peaked at some point in October , at somewhere north of 750% . <p> Many congratulations are due to Bloomberg , for extracting this information from the Fed after a long and arduous fight . It could n't have come at a timelier moment : if the ECB wants to avert a liquidity crisis , charts like this give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , and how quickly it might have to act . <p> On September 16 , 2008 , Morgan Stanley owed $21.5 billion to the Fed . The next day , that number doubled , to $40.5 billion . And eight working days later , on the 29th , the bank 's total borrowings from the Fed reached $107 billion . The Fed did n't blink : it kept on lending , as much as it could , to any bank which needed the money , because , in a crisis , that 's its job . <p> The Fed likes to say that it was n't taking much if any credit risk here : that all its lending was fully collateralized , etc etc . But it 's really hard to look at that red line and have a huge amount of confidence that the Fed was always certain to get its money back . Still , this is what lenders of last resort do . And this is what the ECB is most emphatically not doing . I find it very hard to imagine the ECB lending some random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keeping liquidity flowing . <p> And it 's frankly ridiculous that it 's taken this long for this information to be made public . We 're now fully ten months past the point at which the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission 's final report was published ; this data would have been extremely useful to them and to all of the rest of us trying to get a grip on what was going on at the height of the crisis . The Fed 's argument against publishing the data was that it \" would create a stigma \" , and make it less likely that banks would tap similar facilities in future . But I can assure you that at the height of the crisis , the last thing on Morgan Stanley 's mind was the worry that its borrowings might be made public three years later . When you need the money , and the Fed is throwing its windows wide open , you do n't look that kind of gift horse in the mouth . <p> Every time the Fed fights tooth and nail to prevent certain information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain feeling of anticlimax : we get the information , and ask what on earth is so dangerous about normal people knowing it . The Fed is one of the most vital and least trusted institutions in America , and there 's a reason why a book called End the Fed is still riding high in the Amazon charts , more than two years after it was published . If the Fed wants to get Americans back on its side -- and it needs to get Americans back on its side -- then it will have to stop fighting these silly battles against transparency . Especially since the release of this data has a lot to teach the Fed 's counterparts in Frankfurt . ",

Ranchers are slaughtering starving herds rather than take a total loss . While this has created a brief beef glut with lower prices , expect the long-term loss of herds to bring higher costs for hamburger next year , and for t-bones and roasts in 2013 , says American Public Media 's Marketplace . Many global crops grow best within strict limits of temperature , rainfall and altitude . Half the world 's chocolate , for example , is made from Ghana and Ivory Coast cocoa grown only between 72 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit , at an altitude of 330 to 820 feet .

As urban migration continues apace , these figures are only expected to rise in the short term . While this may initially lead to more pollutants being pumped into the earth 's atmosphere , some experts believe it could work out better in the long term .

        "text":"<h> Scale-up in effective malaria control dramatically reduces deaths <p> News release <p> 9 December 2014 ? Geneva -The number of people dying from malaria has fallen dramatically since 2000 and malaria cases are also steadily declining , according to the World malaria report 2014 . Between 2000 and 2013 , the malaria mortality rate decreased by 47% worldwide and by 54% in the WHO African Region - where about 90% of malaria deaths occur . <p> New analysis across sub-Saharan Africa reveals that despite a 43% population increase , fewer people are infected or carry asymptomatic malaria infections every year : the number of people infected fell from 173 million in 2000 to 128 million in 2013 . <p> \" We can win the fight against malaria , \" says Dr Margaret Chan , Director-General , WHO . \" We have the right tools and our defences are working . But we still need to get those tools to a lot more people if we are to make these gains sustainable . \" <p> \" We have the right tools and our defences are working . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people if we are to make these gains sustainable . \" <p> Dr Margaret Chan , WHO Director-General . <p> Between 2000 and 2013 , access to insecticide-treated bed nets increased substantially . In 2013 , almost half of all people at risk of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa had access to an insecticide-treated net , a marked increase from just 3% in 2004 . And this trend is set to continue , with a record 214 million bed nets scheduled for delivery to endemic countries in Africa by year-end . <p> Access to accurate malaria diagnostic testing and effective treatment has significantly improved worldwide . In 2013 , the number of rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) procured globally increased to 319 million , up from 46 million in 2008 . Meanwhile , in 2013 , 392 million courses of artemisinin-based combination therapies ( ACTs ) , a key intervention to treat malaria , were procured , up from 11 million in 2005 . <h> Moving towards elimination <p> Globally , an increasing number of countries are moving towards malaria elimination , and many regional groups are setting ambitious elimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Asia Summit to eliminate malaria from the Asia-Pacific region by 2030 . <h> Fragile gains <p> But significant challenges remain : \" The next few years are going to be critical to show that we can maintain momentum and build on the gains , \" notes Dr Pedro L Alonso , Director of WHO 's Global Malaria Programme . <p> In 2013 , one third of households in areas with malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa did not have a single insecticide treated net . Indoor residual spraying , another key vector control intervention , has decreased in recent years , and insecticide resistance has been reported in 49 countries around the world . <p> Even though diagnostic testing and treatment have been strengthened , millions of people continue to lack access to these interventions . Progress has also been slow in scaling up preventive therapies for pregnant women , and in adopting recommended preventive therapies for children under 5 years of age and infants . <p> In addition , resistance to artemisinin has been detected in 5 countries of the Greater Mekong subregion and insufficient data on malaria transmission continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Alonso believes , however , that with sufficient funding and commitment huge strides forward can still be made . \" There are biological and technical challenges , but we are working with partners to be proactive in developing the right responses to these . There is a strong pipeline of innovative new products that will soon transform malaria control and elimination . We can go a lot further , \" he says . <p> While funding to combat malaria has increased threefold since 2005 , it is still only around half of the US$ 5.1 billion that is needed if global targets are to be achieved . <p> \" Against a backdrop of continued insufficient funding the fight against malaria needs a renewed focus to ensure maximum value for money , \" says Fatoumata Nafo-Traor ? , Executive Director of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership . \" We must work together to strengthen country ownership , empower communities , increase efficiencies , and engage multiple sectors outside health . We need to explore ways to do things better at all levels . \" <p> Ray Chambers , who has served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 , highlights the remarkable progress made in recent years . \" While staying focused on the work ahead , we should note that the number of children dying from malaria today is markedly less than 8 years ago .

Kathy Kmonicek\/AP <h> What 's Up With That : Why Running Hurts Every Part of Your Body <p> A sea of feet pound the pavement as runners cross the Pulaski Bridge to enter the Queens borough of New York during the New York City Marathon on Sunday , Nov. 2 , 2014 , in New York . Kathy Kmonicek\/AP <p> I 'm already dreading my New Years resolution , and it 's still weeks away . Like millions of other Americans , I 'm going to start working out -- specifically , running . I love the way running makes me feel , but only when I 'm not running . This is because even when I 'm racking up modest mileage , my legs burn , my chest itches , and my lungs feel like they 're filled with a thousand burning matches . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll explain the science behind a strange phenomenon that you may be wondering about , or may be hearing about for the first time right here . If you 've seen or heard of something you 'd like us to explain , send us an email . View the entire collection . <p> I want to be a runner , but even Bruce Springsteen 's exercise anthem \" Born to Run \" ca n't get me excited . ( What 's that ? The song is actually about teenage angst ? Oh , maybe that 's why . ) I do n't want these factors to derail my resolution . To find out why running feels so sucky ( and hopefully make it suck less ) , I called Steven Magness , coach to several Olympians and the University of Houston cross country team , and author of the book The Science of Running . <h> The seven-step itch <p> I do n't want to totally shock my system once January 1st comes around , so I 'm going to prepare myself with short jogs before New Year 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints flooded in from every part of my body . The first came from my skin . I had n't made it to the end of my block before my chest started itching . It was like someone had stuffed my shirt full of wood chips . What 's actually happening , says Magness , is blood flowing into tiny unused capillaries in my skin . In non-runners like me , these capillaries are dormant . When they get flooded with blood irregularly , they swell . This irritates nearby nerve endings , which sends itchy sensations to the brain . <h> Burning muscles <p> Not long after this , a familiar fire started burning inside my leg muscles . Magness assured me that even top runners feel the burn . It 's caused by a buildup of lactic acid , but is really a signal your muscle is using to let your brain know it 's running out of energy . \" Pain is feedback for your brain to let you know how hard you 're working , \" Magness said . Thing is , this pain signal typically comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eventually the burn will simmer down , says Magness . Eventually , you 'll build up enough endurance that your muscles wo n't freak out so soon . <h> Side stitches <p> Not long after I pushed through the burning in my legs , I was assaulted by side cramps . Like a big , invisible hand had grabbed the side of my belly , I doubled over and immediately started walking with my hands on top of my head . The pain subsided , but left me wondering where it came from to begin with . For a while , says Magness , researchers thought was that side stitches would come from the body getting low on electrolytes like sodium and potassium . But , studies showed that electrolyte-depleted athletes are no more prone to side cramps as those drinking healthy amounts of Gatorade . <p> Currently , says Magness , there are two prevailing hypotheses . The first is that running causes you to strain a ligament connecting your diaphragm to the abdominal muscles . \" When you 're running , your diaphragm is working harder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also tied to the abdominal muscles , but has to do with a decrease in calcium , which can prevent muscles from relaxing . <h> Gasping for air <p> Not long after my legs started burning , the fire spread to my lungs and I began gasping for air . This happens , says Magness , because our bodies are n't perfect at cycling CO2 out of our lungs . \" You are breathing so intensely that you ca n't get all of the bad air out , \" Magness said . Even when you 're breathing normally , there 's never a perfect exchange of oxygen to carbon . With running , your muscles get so starved for air that they do n't leave you time to exhale completely . Eventually you build up such a huge deficit that you get a burning sensation similar to holding your breath . \" At this point , you stop , and bend over , and suck in , and you can finally catch up , \" Magness said . <h> \" Bubbleguts \" <p> I had planned a two-mile run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd catch my breath while looking at beautiful San Francisco , then return . I did n't make it so far because my tummy started burbling before I was close to the first sloping street . I ended up speed walking the last few blocks home . \" This is pretty common , \" Magness graciously told me . Many runners also get gassy because their bodies are breaking down energy ( in the form of sugary carbohydrates , solid proteins , or rich fats ) , causing muscles cells to release gas . A lot of this gas ends up not making it to the lungs , where it can be expired without embarrassment . As Magness tactfully put it : \" Gas gets stuck in places where it should n't be , and you got ta get it out some way . \" Also , he says , the mechanical jarring of running helps along the digestion process . <p> Magness says these problems are most common with beginning runners , but even the Olympians he coaches admit to suffering . So maybe I was n't born to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in my misery . Maybe one day I can catch up to the pros , and take my complaining to a whole new level . ",

Franklin The Associated Press ) Willie Jessop , a former spokesperson and head of security of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints before leaving the sect in 2011 , leaves the Sandra Day O'Connor United States District Court after a day of testifying during a federal civil rights trial against two polygamous towns on the Arizona-Utah line on Tuesday in Phoenix . <p> Charlene Wall Jeffs ? Former wife of Lyle Jeffs , the man now running FLDS operations , says lying to the government is OK as long as it 's \" a white lie . \" <p> \" Being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Charlene Wall Jeffs , as she introduced herself to a Phoenix courtroom from the witness stand Wednesday . <p> She has since divorced Lyle Jeffs , the man running the day-to-day operations of the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints . <p> The U.S. Justice Department called Charlene Jeffs as a witness in its discrimination lawsuit against the towns of Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Ariz. , collectively known as Short Creek . The Justice Department alleges the two municipal governments collude with the church to discriminate against people who are not FLDS . <p> While a few wives have testified in proceedings against the FLDS through the years -- including two of Charlene Jeffs ' half-sisters -- Charlene Jeffs may be the first who was legally married to someone so high in the FLDS hierarchy . Lyle Jeffs is believed to have eight other spiritual wives . <p> Charlene Jeffs , 50 , told the jury that her parents joined the FLDS when she was 2 years old and that she grew up in the Salt Lake Valley . <p> \" It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FLDS . \" It was all about family , about love . \" <p> FLDS members were taught that if the government apprehended them , they should agree with their captor until their release , she said . Then they could resume how they were living before . <p> Justice Department attorney Sean Keveney asked her whether that mean it was OK to lie to the government . <p> Her marriage at age 18 to Lyle Jeffs was arranged . The couple went on to have 10 children . They lived in the Salt Lake Valley until 2001 , when the faithful were ordered by her father-in-law , then-FLDS President Rulon Jeffs , to move to Short Creek .

And do n't panic -- these sharks typically have little interest in people , Kajiura told Live Science . <p> Kajiura began surveying the blacktip sharks in 2011 , counting them after they migrate to south Florida during the winter .

He later downloads the stills and footage to count all the visible sharks in the water . <p> \" We see lots more sharks on the other side of the plane , so there 's a lot more out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \" Kajiura told Live Science . \" We simply do n't know how big this school is , how far it extends off into deeper water , \" he said . <p> But people have little to fear from these seasonal visitors , Kajiura added .

And when the water is murky or when it 's dark out , a shark may be more likely to confuse light signals from human movement with prey activity . <p> Otherwise , \" they 're not curious types , \" Kajiura said , and as long as people exercise common sense and do n't harass the sharks , the blacktips will likely just avoid them completely . <p> And lucky beachgoers might even catch a glimpse of the colony without ever entering the water . <p> \" You can literally sit on the beach and you can watch the blacktips jumping and spinning and splashing back into the water , \" Kajiura said . \" They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their diet , so you may as well go to the beach and enjoy the phenomenon . \" ",

Republican wailing over his prospective nomination aside , Donald Trump could beat Hillary Clinton like a drum in November . <p> Indeed , only the fear that Trump can win explains the hysteria in this city . Here is the Washington Post of March 18 : \" As a moral question it is straightforward . The mission of any responsible Republican should be to block a Trump nomination and election . \" <p> The Orwellian headline over that editorial : \" To defend our democracy , the GOP must aim for a brokered convention . \" <p> Beautiful . Defending democracy requires Republicans to cancel the democratic decision of the largest voter turnout of any primaries in American history . And this is now a moral imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures , the Post celebrates democracy -- so long as the voters get it right . <p> Whatever one may think of the Donald , he has exposed not only how far out of touch our political elites are , but how insular is the audience that listens to our media elite . <p> Understandably , Trump 's rivals were hesitant to take him on , seeing the number he did on \" little Marco , \" \" low energy \" Jeb and \" Lyin ' Ted . \" <p> But the Big Media -- the Post , Wall Street Journal , New York Times -- have been relentless and ruthless . <p> Yet Trump 's strength with voters seemed to grow , pari passu , with the savagery of their attacks . As for National Review , the Weekly Standard and the accredited conservative columnists of the big op-ed pages , their hostility to Trump seems to rise , commensurate with Trump 's rising polls . <p> As the Wizard of Oz was exposed as a little man behind a curtain with a big megaphone , our media establishment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once was . <p> And the GOP ? <p> Those Republicans who assert that a Trump nomination would be a moral stain , a scarlet letter , the death of the party , they are most likely describing what a Trump nomination would mean to their own ideologies and interests . <p> Barry Goldwater lost 44 states in 1964 , and the GOP fell to less than a third of Congress . \" The Republican Party is dead , \" wailed the Rockefeller wing . Actually , it was n't . Only the Rockefeller wing was dead . <p> After the great Yellowstone fire in the summer of ' 88 , the spring of ' 89 produced astonishing green growth everywhere . The Yellowstone fire of the GOP was in ' 64 , burning up a million acres of dead wood , preparing the path for party renewal . Renewal often follows rebellion . <p> Republican strength today , on Capitol Hill and in state offices , is at levels unseen since Calvin Coolidge . Turnout in the GOP primaries has been running at levels unseen in American history , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Obama-Clinton race of 2008 . <p> This opportunity for Republicans should be a cause for rejoicing , not all this weeping and gnashing of teeth . If the party in Cleveland can bring together the Trump , Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and John Kasich forces , the White House , Supreme Court and Congress are all within reach . <p> Consider . Clinton was beaten by Bernie Sanders in Michigan , and pressed in Ohio and Illinois , on her support for NAFTA and the trade deals of the Clinton-Bush-Obama era that eviscerated American manufacturing and led to the loss of millions of factory jobs and the stagnation of wages . <p> Sanders ' issues are Trump 's issues . <p> A Trump campaign across the industrial Midwest , Pennsylvania and New Jersey featuring attacks on Hillary Clinton 's support for NAFTA , the WTO , MFN for China -- and her backing of amnesty and citizenship for illegal immigrants , and for the Iraq and Libyan debacles -- is a winning hand . <p> Lately , 116 architects and subcontractors of the Bush I and II foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will not vote for , nor serve in a Trump administration . <p> Talking heads are bobbing up on cable TV to declare that if Trump is nominee , they will not vote for him and may vote for Clinton . <p> This is not unwelcome news . Let them go . <p> Their departure testifies that Trump is offering something new and different from the foreign policy failures this crowd did so much to produce . <p> The worst mistake Trump could make would be to tailor his winning positions on trade , immigration and intervention -- to court such losers . <p> While Trump should reach out to the defeated establishment of the party , he can not compromise the issues that brought him where he is , or embrace the failed policies that establishment produced . This would be throwing away his aces . <p> The Trump campaign is not a hostile takeover of the Republican Party .

A lot of the movie does n't deliver on what the title promises . But there are also a lot of other issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , this was not how the film 's studio , Warner Bros. , was hoping to launch one of its biggest movies of the year , which will be followed by other franchise entries from DC Comics . <p> So before you throw down your money on the movie this weekend , let us tell you the problems that critics had with it . <p> The movie finds no joy in itself . <p> Warner Bros . <p> Taking a page from the \" Dark Knight \" franchise , director Zack Snyder attempts to make a movie that is very , very serious . And critics did n't buy it . <p> \" There 's zero humor or self-deprecation , as there was in Joss Whedon 's pitch-perfect ' The Avengers ' ; no performance of unlikely depth , like the one Heath Ledger pulled off in ' The Dark Knight ' ; and no animating spirit of decency , a trait Christopher Reeve 's Superman had in spades , \" Time Out New York writes . <p> And Indiewire points out a major disappointment of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice ' to justify its title , and another 30 to establish it 's a red herring . \" <p> The Hollywood Reporter questions any collaboration between the two comic-book characters going forward : \" It 's hard to say what ought to happen between Batman and Superman in the future , even , indeed , if they actually should share the screen again . \" <p> This version of Superman is n't likable . <p> Warner Bros . <p> Page 2 of 3 - Henry Cavill as Superman . <p> This is Henry Cavill 's second time playing the character , following 2013 's \" Man of Steel , \" and many critics have been turned off by a Kal-El who seems more jaded than how we 've seen the character portrayed in the past . <p> \" I would have given anything to watch Clark Kent open up his shirt , to reveal that big ' S , ' then go off to save the day as the music swells . But this Superman is n't that Superman , \" Uproxx writes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck with a character who spends far too much time reacting to others , whether it 's to Batman 's taunts or the romantic overtures of Lois Lane ( Amy Adams ) . \" <p> Director Zack Snyder is more interested in blowing things up than telling a story . <p> Warner Bros . <p> Snyder , right , with Ben Affleck . <p> The direction by Snyder , responsible for previous comic book adaptations like \" 300 \" and \" The Watchmen , \" is getting a lot of the blowback . Many critics felt he was too focused on the visuals in \" Batman v Superman . \" <p> \" Although director Zack Snyder is a great visualist , all he has here is pretty pictures and giant ( and confusing ) action sequences , \" NJ.com said . <p> \" Snyder is not without skills , or ideas , \" the Chicago Tribune writes , \" but when a critic finds himself at odds with almost every aspect of a director 's visual approach to material like this , material like this becomes pretty joyless . \" <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Warner Bros . <p> Though critics universally praise the performance by Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and many believe Affleck does a good job as Batman , something about the film 's length and lack of a coherent plot led to the vicious reviews . <p> Page 3 of 3 - \" There 's a lot that 's dumb in ' Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , ' but the dumbest thing is right there in the title , \" The Guardian wrote . \" I could n't really figure out why these two guys were fighting . The film spends time setting up Superman as an unwanted alien ... but I feel that if anyone is going to understand the nuances of being a superhero , it would be Bruce Wayne . \" <p> \" The film is too long by half and yet it never finds time to do any character work , focusing instead on relentlessly moving forward its over-complicated , unmotivated plot , \" Birth Movies Death said . <p> And The New York Times believes \" Batman v Superman \" sums up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that produce movies like this one , and the ambitious hacks who sign up to make them , have no evident motive beyond their own aggrandizement .

        "title":"Larry Sanders, Garry Shandling, and the Refuge of Comedy\n",
        "text":"<h> Larry Sanders , Garry Shandling , and the Refuge of Comedy <p> Comedy is a refuge for unhappy people . At its best , the genre lets you cover up with a blanket in the dark and be around people who are not going to yell at you or call you a loser or rub your failure in your eyes . Here are people who want to make you laugh . And there 's security in that . It 's calming . Being alive means being around people who are meaner than hell , and comedy can have the nobility to say \" all right , let 's make somebody 's day better for half an hour . \" <p> That 's the real appeal , beyond the superficial entertainment value , of something like Cheers , or Sanford and Son . These shows do n't try to teach you , they 're just taking you someplace nicer than you were before . And they can do it in an aspirational way . Where science fiction or pure fantasy asks you to live in an alternate universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can say , \" Here are real people , and they do n't have to be mean to you . This is a version of people that 's better than the one you knew . \" <p> I was 14 when I started watching The Larry Sanders Show -- created by and starring the great Garry Shandling , who passed suddenly on Thursday at the age of 66 -- during its first syndication run outside pay cable . I was a miserable kid , constantly fighting off widescreen grayscale loneliness and alienation , and I was desperate for what I realize now was just normal human interaction and emotion . On paper , I should have hated the show , because it looks and smells like a meta-comedy about a rich guy in Los Angeles with a pretty successful network talk show . Just utter L.A. inside baseball , nothing but Ventura Boulevard and canyons and the 405 at rush hour ; Entourage before Entourage . I should have hated it . It checked every box on my list of TV writing pet peeves . <p> But I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up taping the entire run , in order , on a VCR , because DVD recorders -- the DVR was still many years away -- were still too expensive . Somewhere in the purgatory of my father 's shed , I still have a carefully labeled box containing all episodes of the show on TDK cassettes . <p> I watched it over and over . I memorized not just the words but the beat and melody of the words . I know the damn blocking on some of my favorite scenes . It changed my whole concept of what comedy was allowed to do , and what writers were allowed to do , and I probably would n't be working without it . <p> HBO <p> The reason is this : The Larry Sanders Show certainly looked like a behind-the-scenes comedy about comedy , a self-reflexive intellectual exercise that only clicks with people who know what it 's like to fly from Los Angeles to New York and understand why TV tapings are ultimately sad . But it 's not . That 's just the frame . That was the easiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitcom about real human emotion , the real inner workings of people . It had an emotional intelligence I had no idea could exist in comedy . <p> Before Larry Sanders , as much as I liked sitcoms , I thought every player in the idiom was a stock character , a variant of a type , and had one of about five possible punch lines to a given setup . But here was something where a setup would take place , and the characters would respond like real people . <p> Extreme example : Hank Kingsley ( Jeffrey Tambor ) , Larry 's often-buffoonish sidekick , is meeting the Wu-Tang Clan . In any sitcom before Larry Sanders , the only punch line to that setup , which is , essentially , \" the world 's most uncool uncle meets the world 's coolest musicians , \" is \" Hey , you fellas are rap singers , so I thought I could sing you a rap ! \" <p> But Larry Sanders never fell on stock jokes . So Hank tries to ingratiate himself to them like a real person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest-to-God uncool uncle . The result is a lethal jumble of racism and bewildered hideous ignorance . He calls Ol ' Dirty Bastard \" Dirty Old Bitch \" and claims he hates cops entirely on the basis of his parking tickets . The scene is so uncomfortable you 'll want to scream , and you 'll want to scream because it feels like it 's really happening . There is no artifice . This is a real mistake a real person could make . <p> Moments like that gave the show a sense of danger . Without the artifice of sitcoms that came before , without stock players , stock gags , there were no safety nets . Any bad thing was capable of happening . Characters could break down , try to kill themselves , fail in a way that was n't reversible by next week 's episode . And it was unafraid to go to these places . As funny as Larry Sanders could be , what made it one of the greatest achievements ever in television was how much real pathos it found . It could be downright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonate . Funny moments weigh more when they are surrounded by the real human condition , which is one of constantly staving off sadness and hiding vulnerability and dread . Lots of shows would go on to do that , most notably The Office , alongside the overwhelming majority of tone-blending \" prestige \" comedies -- from Louie to Transparent ( which , perhaps not coincidentally , co-stars Tambor ) to Togetherness -- now on the air . But none of them would exist without Larry Sanders . <p> The triumph of Shandling 's career is that he did n't need to do this show . He had enormous skill as a stand-up . He was a successful sitcom writer . He could have made a great conventional sitcom -- though , years before Sanders , he created and starred in the groundbreaking , convention-subverting It 's Garry Shandling 's Show -- and he was a regular guest host on Johnny Carson 's Tonight Show , where he was even offered the opportunity to make that a permanent fill-in gig . ( It goes without saying he would have been better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But he did n't take any of these paths before him . He made something with soul instead . <p> And this is not the sentimental overrating of a recently deceased performer 's work . Garry Shandling is on record about his ambitions for the show . In Judd Apatow 's interview collection Sick in the Head , he spells it out : <p> \" When we were doing Larry Sanders , it was all about life and the question of self and what you were bringing to it . ... And what people are always covering up -- the tension between what they 're covering emotionally in life and what 's really going on inside them . What you really want to write is what they 're covering ; otherwise you end up writing the exposition -- which is just words . \" <p> A couple moments jumped out at me when I got the call yesterday and learned Garry Shandling had died . They were both from the Larry Sanders finale , and they both underline its emotional depth . The first is when Larry has ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there , the lights are still on him , he 's on a stool . His producer , Artie ( Rip Torn ) , comes over to him and says it was a great show . They embrace . Then Larry chokes out the words \" I ca n't get off the stool . I ca n't move my legs . \" It 's a pitch-perfect depiction of a panic attack , and that just was n't done in comedy at that time , and if it was , it was melodramatic . This was real . <p> The other moment comes just a bit later . The studio is empty . Everyone is gone . Larry 's walking around absently , missing what is now his old life . Artie is sitting in the back drinking booze out of a coffee cup . And they talk about their plans and their regrets , quietly internalizing the fact that the active part of their adulthood is over . They 're old men now . Then Hank shows up . And this is the perfect example of what Shandling was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . <p> Hank is superficially furious that his segment got cut . He seems prepared to kill somebody . And he delivers a fire-and-brimstone monologue most people ca n't walk back . <p> \" What is my problem ? I spent the last 10 years being the butt of your jokes . The little fucking dog at the end of the couch ! And you know , it 's my fault , because I smiled and I let it happen because this face was being seen by millions of people every night and there was lots of money and there was lots of pussy ! \" <p> Larry tries to defuse with a joke . <p> \" More money than pussy . \" <p> Hank lunges at him , and this is not a comedy about comedy anymore . This is Greek tragedy . <p> \" No more ! \" roars Hank . \" I swear to God , no more , one more remark and I , I , I swear , I 'll fucking choke you with my hands ! \" <p> He tries to walk off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leaves , backs his car into a dumpster , and comes back in tears . They all reconcile and agree to go to the Smoke House for drinks . Hank and Artie leave , but Larry stays behind a second , surveying the darkened stage , aware that his set will be torn down by morning and thrown into the garbage . Any other show would have tried to arrange a more cinematic happy ending . But this is an honest happy ending . None of these men is happy , but they 've found acceptance , and that 's a more honest victory . ",

Steve Van Kuiken is the pastor . Traditionally at the end of the Easter service , the congregation releases helium-filled balloons that float to the ceiling of the Gothic-style sanctuary , and slowly descend to the floor during the following week . <p> It 's not the way most congregations celebrate Easter , but Lake Street is n't like most churches , and Van Kuiken is n't like most Christian ministers . <p> When he was the pastor of Mount Auburn Presbyterian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the local Presbyterian governing body defrocked him because he had performed marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples . <p> The Presbytery of Cincinnati , a group of 86 local churches that included Mount Auburn , voted to remove Van Kuiken as pastor of the church . Almost a year later , a higher Presbyterian church court , the Permanent Judicial Commission of the Synod of the Covenant , reversed that decision and reinstated him as a minister . <p> The vindication came a little late for Van Kuiken , who had already accepted a separation agreement from Mount Auburn , which he said included about a year 's worth of pay . <p> At that time , the Presbyterian Church USA permitted \" holy union \" ceremonies between same-sex couples , but nothing , such as an exchange of rings , that might cause people to confuse them with a real marriage ceremony . In those holy union ceremonies , ministers were not allowed to imply that they were blessing sexual intimacy , either . <p> \" It 's a travesty , \" Van Kuiken told the Cincinnati Post at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the case ? \" <p> After he left Mount Auburn , Van Kuiken served as pastor for a small group of former Mount Auburn members that called themselves The Gathering . They met initially at one another 's houses , then at the former St. George Catholic Church building in Clifton , then in an Over-the-Rhine storefront . <p> The congregation could only pay him for part-time work , so he took a job working in a halfway house in Over-the-Rhine for former federal prisoners . After about seven years of doing both jobs , he said , it began to wear on him , and he started looking for a full-time pastoral job . <p> Meanwhile , The Gathering continued to grow , and in 2007 became part of the United Church of Christ . Last May , the congregation merged with Northern Hills Unitarian Church at 460 Fleming Road , and the two congregations became The Gathering at Northern Hills . <p> Van Kuiken loved living and working in Tucson , he said , but it was a bit far from his grown daughters in Cincinnati and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also live nearby . <p> Three years ago , he took the job in Evanston because it was closer to home , he said , but also because the congregation felt like a better fit for his beliefs . It 's officially part of the American Baptist Churches USA , which he said is the most liberal Baptist denomination , he said , but \" it 's way to the left \" of any other American Baptist church . <p> Visitors would recognize Sunday worship as being rooted in the Christian tradition , he said , with readings from the Bible , organ music and some familiar hymns . But they would also hear some Buddhist or Hindu readings , he said , because many of the church 's 200 or so members also identify with other religious traditions . <p> The congregation also believes strongly in working for social justice , he said , and the church has been \" welcoming and affirming \" toward gay and lesbian members since 1993 . <p> Since the PCUSA defrocked Van Kuken , much has changed in that denomination and in attitudes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 , the PCUSA agreed to change its definition of marriage from a covenant between a man and woman to one between two people . In June , in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges , the Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states . <p> It surprised Van Kuiken how quickly things changed , he said , and he thinks that what he did helped move the needle a bit in the Presbyterian Church . He 's proud to have played a small role in changing society 's attitudes , and the rapidity of the change gives him hope for other social justice struggles . <p> \" One thing I 've learned is that it 's not hopeless . It can change , \" he said . \" All these causes we 're working for now , whether it 's racial justice , or universal health care , any kind of thing , we 're working for victories that we ca n't even imagine will happen . It 's a very hopeful thing . \" <p> Copyright 2016 Scripps Media , Inc . All rights reserved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or redistributed. ",

        "text":"<h> Only three of the top 50 free agents remain unsigned <p> Posted by Zac Jackson on March 27 , 2016 , 5:45 PM EDT <p> Getty Images <p> Just about all the big-ticket shopping is done . <p> With NFL teams turning their full attention to the draft , the first phase of free agency is all but over . Following some notable transactions last week , just three players on the PFT Hot 100 Free Agent List remain unsigned : No. 25 Ryan Fitzpatrick , No. 33 Reggie Nelson and No. 45 Nick Fairley , who 's reportedly getting close to a deal with the Saints . <p> Only a couple major Pro Day workouts remain on the calendar , so teams are turning their attention toward private workouts and the final round of pre-draft meetings . There still could be a signing or two pop up on the transaction wire , but sometimes players still available after the first wave of movement choose to wait , thinking they 'll have more leverage or more options following the draft . <p> This year 's draft is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bit of a staredown , with the Broncos looming as a possible contender . Nelson will have multiple options , too , though one of them probably disappeared last week when the Titans signed former Cardinals safety Rashad Johnson . It 's not just the first wave that went fast ; with the Cowboys having signed running back Alfred Morris last week , players 51-66 on the Hot 100 list all have new contracts . <p> How was Ronnie Hillman not in the top 50 ? I did n't look at the list before I wrote this comment but I 'm sure he 's better than some of the players that were at the bottom-end of the top 50 . For example , Nick Fairley . Are you kidding me ? Hillman 100% has more value than him , IMO . Yes , Hillman is a change of pace back , but he can provide homerun-type plays and carry the load for a few games if the starter goes down . <p> intrafinesse says:Mar 27 , 2016 5:55 PM <p> Kind of sad when a back up level QB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you watch the Jets games last year , he got huge help from Brandon Marshall . Fitzpatrick could lob it up and Marshall hauled it in . If Fitzpatrick had just an average WR , his stats would have been much worse . <p> \" How was Ronnie Hillman not in the top 50 ?

Most were post patterns in the middle of the end zone . Tight throws necessary . You can find a lot of receivers that are considered top guys that had less than 12 TDs , and Decker was the second target for Fitz . <p> Nelson would be a good fit in Pittsburgh on a one or two year deal . Of course the fact that they are division rivals make the extremely unlikely to happen but it would be a great fit for the player and the team <p> Fits played good last year , minus the last game . They should give him a fair one year contract for $10-$12 mil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> tedmurph says:Mar 27 , 2016 6:58 PM <p> Fitzpatrick had a career year last year . 3900 yrds , 31 TDs , 19 INTs , 88 rating . He 's absolutely a starting level QB . Not a superstar , but a middle of the pack guy . With Bowles and their personnel on D , they have a shot to make some noise this yr . Shoulda made the playoffs last yr . If they go from Fitz to GSmith , IMO , they go from having a shot to no shot . <p> On another note , the Jags did a nice job in free agency . Giants spent a lot of money . Meh . I think the Raiders did a nice job too . Watch out for the Jags and the Raiders this year , as sleeper teams . <p> Fitzpatrick should curb the ego and be thankful to be in the NFL . He 's a journeyman veteran qb that happened to have a big year . Whoopedy doo . Jets should give him a one year deal to prove he can do it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrafinesse says : Mar 27 , 2016 5:55 PM Kind of sad when a back up level QB ( Ryan Fitzpatrick ) is a top 50 free agent . <p> If you watch the Jets games last year , he got huge help from Brandon Marshall .

If Fitzpatrick had just an average WR , his stats would have been much worse . <p> Ryan Fitzpatrick may be better than Geno Smith , but he 's not a starting quality QB . <p> -- - <p> Unfortunately , in today 's NFL , Fitz is actually a starting QB . Can you honestly name 32 QBs better than him ? And that just goes to show you why QBs like Osweiler are getting paid . Because there just are n't enough even average QBs out there to field one for each NFL team . And today 's NFL is a QB driven NFL , so even backup quality QBs are in the top 25 . Because Fitz may not be that good , but he 's a better option than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted to oblivion , and that 's understandable . He was not a top 50 FA . But the fact that people are upvoting that he sucks , just shows that not many of you watched the Broncos this year . Hillman is definitely not a true #1 , but he is a decent change of pace back . <p> stoneydog1000 says:Mar 27 , 2016 8:35 PM <p> Why is \" nhpats \" so infatuated with the Bengals and Andy Dalton ? Do the Patriots bore you ? <p> cont ... On Hillman . Chris Ivory was n't much better than Hillman , and he was the AFC 's leading rusher . Give Hillman the same amount of carries and his numbers would 've been almost identical to Ivory , except Hillman would 've had more touchdowns . Look it up , dude definitely did n't suck <p> Its not as hard as you think to be a top 50 FA . First of all , you need to be a FA .... most players that easily would be near the top of that list , teams refuse to let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 10 and 50 and its pretty good size gap . <p> Then when you play premium spot like QB it drives up your value , just like playing Kicker or Punter , hurts it . Fitz is holding the cards , he knows he could be the starter in NY or Denver , so why not put the pressure on him , he knows this is probably his last contract so he is trying to maximize it , especially when he is looking around at players like Cousins and Oswieler getting big money yes those players have upside , but a starter in the NFL now after the rookie contract gets 15 mil . <p> Fitzpatrick .... ugh ..... If the Jets had n't gotten Petty for Discount Store prices , they would put more stock in him and he would be much further along . He needs to be somewhere he can develop behind one of the Stud QB 's . <p> I am surprised Denver has n't made a run @ Fitz , they do n't have much more time with their present team <p> boltergeist19 says:Mar 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ways after the draft . Fits will sign with an incentive laden contract for 1 maybe 2 years or just in case there is trade talk with Wilkerson and movement with some other teams backups like Glennon , or McClown , or Hoyer or if they draft another project behind Geno and Bryce and convince everyone the team is going into camp with a QB battle and the best one will be there QB . Which means they will have screwed up team chemistry and Brandon Marshall will flip out and use the retire card and it will be a mess with 3 guys who do n't know where any stand during the QB round robin season of qbs . It will turn out like Houston 's problems with qbs last year . They all will start games and be up and down 1 good game 1 bad then they go to the next guy 1 good 1 bad then they finally give up at 3-6 and explain they are going with the rookie ( insert here ) for the rest of the year which means a lost season and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mgmt when they can push the Patriots for the division . Never get teams that do this . <p> Nelson will get a call when someone and it always happens where a knee gets hacked or someone tweaks an achilles ' tendon . But it wo n't be more then league minimum with incentives . I am thinking most GMs think his year last year was due to a good supporting cast and wo n't repeat his performance coupled with age to be cautious here . <p> And Hardy will get picked up by a team on another 1 year deal , by Seattle , Buffalo if they can find $ , or back with Dallas . If it 's Dallas , Garret will tell the media he is impressed with how he has come in humbled and a great teammate and is working very hard to put the past behind him and of course \" prove all the doubters wrong . \" With his play . Another words \" total spin , \" from the comment he made a few weeks back , \" Greg Hardy is a free agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 33 year old QB 11 seasons and 6 different teams to have his best season . <p> Ryan , Cutler and Stafford all had a better QB rating and completion % . 2 of the 3 threw for more yards ... all 3 are younger and already signed . None of the 3 are a career journeyman . Ask Tampa how they fell about throwing money at Josh McCown . <p> You can debate if Matt Ryan , Jay Cutler and Matt Stafford are \" franchise \" QBs but there is no debate about Ryan Fitzpatrick . <p> I am not too surprised Nelson is n't signed , he is going to be 33 yrs old by the 3 or 4th game of the season , while he did have a great season , the 07 class is winding down .. you have players like Megatron , Lynch , Patrick Willis retired . <p> AP , Joe Thomas , and Greg Olsen are all getting up there in age , he may be like a James Jones where if someone gets hurt you may bring him in , but other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think we should all take a moment to thank the Houston Texans and the Philadelphia Eagles for the fact that we now live in a world where Ryan Fitzpatrick thinks he 's worth $18m a year . <p> If a completely unproven backup who got benched for a 40 year old who could n't throw the ball 15 yards down the field and a rag armed china doll who ca n't stay on the field and has never won anything can get that much , why should n't he ? <p> Ca n't really blame him . He has , in fact , shown better results over a larger sample size than both of those guys put together . ",

        "text":"<h> The inside story of why the WNBA draft picks did the same fist bump at the draft <p> UNCASVILLE , Conn. -- After being announced as the top WNBA draft pick , former UConn star Breanna Stewart strode to the stage . She hugged her parents , her former teammates who in a few minutes would go second and third in the draft . She hugged UConn coach Geno Auriemma . <p> Finally , she arrived at the stage to greet WNBA president Lisa Borders . Instead of the familiar awkward hug or handshake that often accompanies WNBA drafts , the two went in for a fist bump and then flashed three fingers in the air to form a ' W ' . <p> \" So we 're giving each other a pound and then showing three fingers . This is actually a W , \" Borders explained later , with her fingers in the air in a W shape . \" It 's for the WNBA and in sign language this is actually a W. So W for women and W for the WNBA . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our 20th season , \" Borders said . \" We want to celebrate in so many different ways ... we thought we have to have some way to great one another on a regular basis for the W for the 20th and beyond and this is what we came up with . \" <p> Borders , a former Coca-Cola executive who is in her first season with the league , introduced the fist bump to the potential draft picks at pre-draft orientation . <p> Former South Carolina player Tiffany Mitchell , who was selected as the ninth pick at the draft , said there was a bit of pressure to get the fist bump right -- especially with all of the emotion surrounding the night .

        "text":"<p> For the first time in the modern primary era , the New York presidential primary election , happening today , is actually important in the races for both the Republican and Democratic nominations . For the conscientious citizen , this is lousy news . You can no longer engage in the beloved New York tradition of just writing in Howard Stern , confident that your vote would n't have mattered anyway . <p> We are sensitive to the terrible burden this places on our readers , and so we have decided to undertake the rare of step of issuing endorsements in both the Republican and Democratic primaries . While our writers are free to support candidates of their choosing , Gawker , which is based in New York , has historically been reluctant to officially endorse particular candidates in local or national elections . ( Though we have not avoided endorsements entirely . ) <p> Chances are good that you ca n't vote anyway , because you were self-righteous ( or ill-informed ) enough to register as an independent , or as a member of the Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register as a Democrat or Republican , your vote today matters . Please consider our plea to not exercise this terrible power . <p> Advertisement <h> Do n't Vote For Donald Trump <p> Yeah , this one 's a no-brainer , right ? <p> Though you 'd be surprised ! There are , theoretically , reasons a thinking person might vote for Donald Trump . Trump is actively sabotaging the Republican Party and breaking the conservative movement 's hold on it , two very laudable goals . He is , counterintuitively , the least-conservative Republican in the race , and the most likely to govern as something resembling a moderate . Because he is beholden to none of the traditional ideological stakeholders in the Republican Party , Trump might even be uniquely suited to break the hold the most reactionary elements have over the GOP . <p> Sponsored <p> But , you know , there 's also the xenophobic ethnonationalism bordering on support for ethnic cleansing , the shameless embrace of political violence , the unmistakable parallels to the rise of the new European crypto-fascist right , the grotesque sexism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sausage fingers on the button the survivors of his presidency would end up living in The Road . <p> You should n't vote for Donald Trump . But you knew that already . <h> Do n't Vote For Ted Cruz <p> Again , it may seem like a no-brainer . <p> There is no good outcome to a Trump versus Cruz fight . Trump is a rabble-rousing racist white populist with no core principles . Cruz is a true-believing extremist . Trump would probably be a horrible president . Cruz would definitely be a horrible president . He 's a right-wing zealot , an evangelical fanatic , and an agent of plutocracy . The scariest thing about Ted Cruz is that he 's apparently smart enough to become hugely successful despite lacking any ability to win allies or even friends . If he was even slightly personable he 'd be unstoppable . <p> Advertisement <p> However , even a conservative -- a rabid conservative -- should n't vote for Cruz . He 'd be the most conservative candidate since Barry Goldwater , and , barring an extremely unlikely Democratic collapse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's defeat marked the beginning of the long ascendance of the conservative movement , Cruz 's defeat would look much more like its closing bookend . He would discredit movement conservatism for a generation , and the \" moderate \" business interests of the party would immediately work to seize control of the GOP from both the insurgent ideologues and the rowdy populists . ( This is also sort of the reason to hope that conservatives do vote for Cruz . ) <h> Do n't Vote For John Kasich <p> This is less of an issue in New York , thanks to our closed primaries , but every ostensible Democrat or liberal who casts a vote for Kasich because they feel some responsibility to help \" stop Trump \" is doing nothing but making it a bit more likely that our next president will be a very conservative Republican . <p> The idiotic supporters of Marco Rubio liked to claim that \" the media \" and liberals enjoyed watching Rubio fail because they were scared of him . Nope . We liked watching Marco Rubio fail because it was very funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'm speaking both for the left and the press , I 'll be totally honest : Kasich has always been the most plausibly electable candidate in the entire GOP field , and I 'm pretty sure he 'd beat Hillary Clinton . Hell , I think Romney should have picked him as his running mate in 2012 . The worst-case scenario for Democrats is that Kasich emerges from a contested convention with the nomination . <p> President Kasich would be George W. Bush 's third term , only with a large ( and significantly more conservative ) Republican Congressional majority baked in . Can you even imagine how much damage he and Paul Ryan could do in one term ? Just about every upwardly redistributive policy the American Enterprise Institute can think of would be jammed through before liberals had time to catch their breath . <p> Just about the best thing we can hope for with Kasich is that his rote hawkishness is completely insincere , because otherwise we 'll get sequels both to the Bush tax cuts and the Iraq War . <h> Do n't Vote For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . It will be a disaster mainly because our entire political system is a disaster . <p> This is not particular to her . Clinton 's first term would be , in large part , a continuation of the Obama presidency , featuring similar domestic priorities , appointees , nominees , and arguments . It would also be a continuation of the Democratic Party 's odd semi-decline , which has seen it effectively become a party that is capable only of winning the presidency and , in extraordinarily good years , tenuous control of the Senate . If Clinton represents the Democratic Party establishment , it 's an establishment that is guilty of electoral malpractice on a grand scale . The party is totally unprepared to capitalize on the fact that the Republican presidential nominee is likely to be among the least-liked in modern history : As David Dayen pointed out in The New Republic last month , there will be at least 27 Congressional races this November in which no Democrats will appear on the ballots at all ; two of those races are for seats Democrats held prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically Clinton 's fault , of course , but neither will it be specifically her fault when the feebleness of the Democratic Party and the general brokenness of our entire presidential system causes her first term to be a depressing continuation of the alienating gridlock that has characterized the Tea Party era . Whatever gains the Democrats make in 2016 will likely be wiped out in 2018 . Assuming Republicans maintain statehouse control nationwide -- a safe enough assumption , considering the fecklessness of the Democratic Party -- the 2020 census will lock in a Republican House for another decade . <p> This is why praise for Clinton 's \" realism \" is so misguided . Want to talk about what 's realistic ? Even the most modest center-left agenda imaginable stands no hope of being enacted legislatively no matter who the next president is . Clinton , for all that her supporters talk of her ability to get things done within the system , will have no magical ability to work with a Republican Congress on anything substantive . If they do find common ground , watch out : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Republicans in Congress , those compromises have involved the Clintons supporting conservative policy -- from welfare reform to then-Senator Clinton 's odd 2005 decision to co-sponsor a bill that would make flag-burning illegal . <p> That incident is actually a fine example of how Clinton 's reactionary political instincts have been out-of-date for more than a decade . The flag-burning bill was supposed to be a \" compromise \" from the conservative priority of a flag-burning Constitutional amendment , which Republicans introduced in every Congress following the 1994 \" Republican Revolution . \" They have n't introduced it again since 2006 , because even by then it was clearly no longer a wedge issue voters actually cared about . <p> Even if Penn , Sydney Blumenthal , and Lanny Davis are too toxic to return to a Clinton White House in major official capacities , there 's little reason to believe that Clinton wo n't just fill her administration with spiritual successors to those craven loyalists . ( This even before we get to the likely return of economic advisers and appointees in the Rubin\/Summers mold , or maybe even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foreign policy , an area in which there is actual daylight between Clinton and the man she hopes to replace . Barack Obama seems more skeptical of America 's ability to improve the world through hegemonic displays of force than any president since World War II . Even that skepticism did n't stop him from from regularly intervening across the world , with very little to show for it but a large death toll and yet more \" instability . \" <p> Clinton does not share Obama 's skepticism , at all . She 's always been naturally hawkish , and when the Democratic debates touch on foreign policy , she tends to sound like she 'd be right at home on stage with Kasich and Cruz . Her serene self-confidence in her demonstrably poor judgment on matters of war and peace is her most troubling quality . <h> Do n't Vote For Bernie Sanders <p> There are plenty of perfectly legitimate political reasons for a left-leaning voter not to support Sanders , of course . He has his unliberal gun record , he voted for the same crime bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dabbled in anti-immigration rhetoric in the recent past . As president , he may outsource his defense policy-making to the same sorts of \" liberal interventionists \" who have kept us in constant war even after we elected a president whose popularity was due in part to his opposition to the Iraq invasion . Perhaps his policies , if actually instituted , would actually lead to a tax revolt or mass middle class backlash . <p> There 's also the fact Bernie Sanders will probably not win the Democratic nomination , barring a completely unforeseeable development -- Clinton decides she 's sick of this shit and drops out of the race , basically . <p> Still , if you find that you are closer to Sanders than to Clinton on most of the issues on which they differ , then by all means vote for him . There 's always a shot , no matter how unlikely it currently seems . But that unlikely Bernie Sanders victory could still end up turning out horribly even for people inclined to support him . <p> First of all , if Sanders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party establishment would respond with fury . They 'd purge leftists , rig the nominating process even further , and do everything they could to eliminate any trace of economic populism from the party 's platform . The next nominee would probably be young , probably a person of color , and -- most importantly -- they would be deeply allied with the investor class wing of the party . ( Cory Booker , in other words , or someone very much like him . ) Just as McGovern 's landslide loss led directly to the DLC and the Third Way , so would a Sanders loss lead to the further gentrification of the Democratic Party . <p> If Sanders did win it all ? It could still end up being an unmitigated disaster for the American left , because making him a failed president would be the top priority of the entire American monied elite . <p> Not to exaggerate Sanders ' radicalism , but the phenomenon of his campaign can be understood as a popular revolt against the dominant ideology of our era , which is ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a lot of contested meanings , and is too often simply leftist shorthand for \" stuff I do n't like , \" but it 's still a useful umbrella term for what the Marxist economist Chris Dillow recently described -- accurately , I think -- as \" not so much a coherent intellectual project as a series of opportunistic ad hoc uses of capitalist power . \" <p> Power is the operative word there : The rentiers have pretty much all of it , and they are willing to exercise it to protect their interests . <p> When the left-wing , anti-austerity Syriza party took power in Greece , that nation 's creditors -- the European Commission , European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund -- effectively blackmailed the entire country into accepting austerity , exercising veto power over democracy itself . A hypothetical Sanders presidency probably would n't face a quashing quite that brutal -- or blatant -- but Greece shows how few compunctions the investor class has about undermining democracy to ensure the success of its preferred economic arrangements . <p> Sanders would be an ineffective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because the system itself would rebel against him . He would n't just face an intransigent Republican-controlled Congress , he 'd likely also face an open revolt by the business class element of the Democratic Party -- the element that has totally dominated the party since the decline of big labor . If President Sanders tried anything truly radical , he could expect to see skittish \" centrist \" Democratic senators joining Republicans in blocking his appointees , the Supreme Court blocking his executive actions , and perhaps even the Federal Reserve working to undermine his economic policy . The worst-case scenario ? Impeachment , and the foreclosing of any hope of the left building on his presidency to establish true social democracy in America . There 's no reason to believe that Sanders ' \" political revolution , \" a naive belief in mass electoral action to fix structural problems baked into our political system , would be able to overcome the unprecedented opposition that would arise in response to any attempt to enact his agenda . <p> All of that assumes President Sanders actually would make good on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . There 's also the chance that he 'd just be a mostly conventional Democratic president . If that 's true , what 's worth getting so excited about , exactly ? <p> It would be better , surely , for the left to build on what Sanders accomplishes in defeat , and seriously plot a systematic takeover of the Democratic Party , rather than pin the movement 's hopes on one presidential candidate . Fixating on the presidency might be a waste of activist energy and donor funds , when there are Andrew Cuomos and Rahm Emanuels out there who need defeating first . ",

( CBS4 ) -- Centennial Airport may be leading the way in the return of supersonic flight . <p> The Concorde was a supersonic jet the hopped the pond , New York City to London , in just 3 ? hours . The jet was retired in 2003 after guzzling jet fuel and creating sonic booms for decades . <p> \" We offer something completely different which is getting there in less than half the time , \" said CEO of Boom Blake Scholl . <p> Conventional aircraft take about seven hours to reach Europe . <p> Boom ( credit : CBS ) <p> Scholl has hired his 13th engineer with more to come . He dreams of reviving supersonic flight and showed CBS4 's Howard Nathan an engine that has already flown at the supersonic speed of more than twice the speed of sound . <p> Scholl and Nathan walked on a tape outline of the jet being developed at Centennial Airport . <p> CBS4 's Howard Nathan interview Blake Scholl ( credit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how big it 's going to be , this is what ? \" <p> Scholl replied , \" This is one third scale the prototype , 50 feet long . \" <p> Plans call for building the prototype this August with hundreds more of the full sized jet that will carry about 40 passengers . Compared to the old 100-seater that charged $20,000 for a ticket , the Boom ticket might run about $5,000 . <p> The possibility of business in Britain means a departure from New York at 6 a.m. followed by a full day of work in England . <p> \" Catch a 9:30 flight from London , back to New York , you land in New York at 8 o'clock , the day you left , you can tuck your kids into bed , \" said Scholl . <p> Initially the plane will not fly at supersonic speed over land . Aviation regulations say the plane can reach supersonic speed only when it 's over the ocean . Scholl is hoping the return to supersonic flight will change that rule . <p> Scholl is supported by aviation industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines fame wants to buy 10 of his supersonic jets . <p> Howard Nathan is a veteran newsman .

        "text":"<h> The UK economy is slowing -- and it 's not just because of the ' Brexit ' vote <p> What is likely to happen in the event of a \" Brexit \" ? Bank of England governor , Mark Carney debates the scenarios and talks about the central bank 's position on giving forecasts versus risks . <p> The Bank of England cut its growth outlook for the U.K. from 2016 through to 2018 on Thursday , as it announced no change to its main interest rate and stock of purchased assets . <p> Members of the Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted unanimously to keep the main rate at the record-low of 0.5 percent and maintain the bank 's stock of purchased assets at ? 375 billion ( $543.4 billion ) . The follows the MPC 's meeting this week and came as no surprise after seven years of holding rates . <p> \" In the United Kingdom , activity slowed in the first quarter and a further deceleration is expected in the second quarter . There are increasing signs that uncertainty associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee 's latest projections , activity growth recovers later in the year , but to rates that are a little below their historical average , \" the bank 's summary of the MPC meeting said . <p> Bloomberg <p> Guests wearing pro-Brexit t-shirts arrive for the premiere of \" Brexit : The Movie \" in London . <p> U.K. gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth is now seen averaging 2.0 percent in 2016 , down from the 2.2 percent forecast by the bank in February . Growth is seen at 2.3 percent in both 2017 and 2018 , down from the 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent annual rates forecast in February . <p> The bank said U.K. economic activity growth would pick up by mid-2017 in the event of a \" remain \" vote , but would be weaker than forecast in February . It attributed this to disappointing productivity growth , fiscal consolidation and relatively high debt-to-income ratios that suggested households would be less likely to cut back on saving and spend more than assumed previously . <p> \" The biggest risk to the forecast remains the referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a media conference on Thursday . <p> \" If there were a vote to leave ... we would expect a material slowdown in growth and a notable rise inflation -- a challenging trade-off , \" he later said . <h> Recession risk <p> Carney added that in a downside a scenario , a \" Brexit \" could result in a technical recession -- a risk several economists have touted in recent weeks . <p> U.K. GDP growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year , down from 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 . The bank sees growth slowing further between April and June this year , to 0.3 percent . <p> The U.K. Treasury estimated in April that Britain would be worse off by ? 4,300 per household per year after 15 years outside the European Union ( EU ) . <p> Carney said a Brexit would likely result in a higher risk premium on sterling assets and a decline in foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . <p> \" It would appear that some of the considerations behind FDI is the U.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said at the conference . <h> Sterling fall partly due to referendum <p> Sterling has declined by around 9 percent since in a peak in November 2015 . The bank said in its inflation report on Thursday that roughly half of that decline reflected the perceived risks of the Brexit vote . <p> Carney said the currency could suffer a further sharp fall if the country quit the EU . <p> In its report , the bank addedthat the cost of insuring against a depreciation in sterling , versus an appreciation , had increased substantially , suggesting market participants saw a further steep decline in the U.K. pound as relatively likely following the referendum . <p> The impact on other U.K. assets , such as equities , was harder to quantify , the central bank said . <p> Carney added that it was a fair assumption that international financial markets would suffer negative spillovers from a Brexit . He said this was the no. 1 issue raised when he met with fellow central bank governors , foreign ministers and heads of major international corporations , banks and asset management firms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to negative spillovers : BoE Carney <p> CNBC 's Geoff Cutmore asks Bank of England governor , Mark Carney about the global repercussions that could take effect , in the event that the U.K. chooses to leave the European Union . <h> Further easing ? <p> The fallout from a Brexit vote could be such that the bank introduces new monetary easing measures . These could include quantitative easing , credit easing or additional liquidity facilities for banks , Carney said on Thursday . <p> He added that the Brexit referendum posed a more serious economic risk than 2014 's Scottish independence vote . <p> \" The issues around Scotland principally affected financial stability in the short-term ... these were issues that we took seriously ... but they were not issues that at the time , in the judgement of the MPC , rose to the level of being the biggest risk to the economic outlook to the U.K. , \" Carney said . <p> He denied the bank was breaching its political independence by setting out the risks of leaving the EU . <p> \" We are providing information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives a sense of the major risk , \" Carney said . <h> Rates seen lower for longer <p> The Bank of England held its forecast for consumer inflation at 0.4 percent for the second quarter of 2016 -- far below the targeted 2.0 percent . <p> \" This shortfall is due predominately to unusually large drags from energy and food prices , which are expected to fade over the next year , \" the bank said in its summary of the MPC meeting . <p> It cut its forecast for the second quarter of 2017 to 1.5 percent from 1.6 percent and held its estimate for second quarter 2018 at 2.1 percent . Inflation is seen at 2.2 percent in the second quarter of 2019 . <p> The bank now sees its base rate remaining at 0.5 percent until the second quarter of 2017 at the earliest , having previously forecast the rate would reach 0.6 percent by then . It also cut its predicted rate for the second quarter of 2018 to 0.6 percent from 0.9 percent . <p> External forecasters are more bullish , forecasting the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 and 1.3 percent by the same period in 2018 , according to the Bank of England .

375 billion ( $543.4 billion ) . the follows the mpc 's meeting this week and came as no surprise after seven years of holding rates . <p> \" in the united kingdom , activity slowed in the first quarter and a further deceleration is expected in the second quarter . there are increasing signs that uncertainty associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee 's latest projections , activity growth recovers later in the year , but to rates that are a little below their historical average , \" the bank 's summary of the mpc meeting said . <p> bloomberg <p> guests wearing pro-brexit t-shirts arrive for the premiere of \" brexit : the movie \" in london . <p> u.k. gross domestic product ( gdp ) growth is now seen averaging 2.0 percent in 2016 , down from the 2.2 percent forecast by the bank in february . growth is seen at 2.3 percent in both 2017 and 2018 , down from the 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent annual rates forecast in february . <p> the bank said u.k. economic activity growth would pick up by mid-2017 in the event of a \" remain \" vote , but would be weaker than forecast in february . it attributed this to disappointing productivity growth , fiscal consolidation and relatively high debt-to-income ratios that suggested households would be less likely to cut back on saving and spend more than assumed previously . <p> \" the biggest risk to the forecast remains the referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a media conference on thursday . <p> \" if there were a vote to leave ... we would expect a material slowdown in growth and a notable rise inflation -- a challenging trade-off , \" he later said . <h> recession risk <p> carney added that in a downside a scenario , a \" brexit \" could result in a technical recession -- a risk several economists have touted in recent weeks . <p> u.k. gdp growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year , down from 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 . the bank sees growth slowing further between april and june this year , to 0.3 percent . <p> the u.k. treasury estimated in april that britain would be worse off by ? 4,300 per household per year after 15 years outside the european union ( eu ) . <p> carney said a brexit would likely result in a higher risk premium on sterling assets and a decline in foreign direct investment ( fdi ) . <p> \" it would appear that some of the considerations behind fdi is the u.k. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said at the conference . <h> sterling fall partly due to referendum <p> sterling has declined by around 9 percent since in a peak in november 2015 . the bank said in its inflation report on thursday that roughly half of that decline reflected the perceived risks of the brexit vote . <p> carney said the currency could suffer a further sharp fall if the country quit the eu . <p> in its report , the bank addedthat the cost of insuring against a depreciation in sterling , versus an appreciation , had increased substantially , suggesting market participants saw a further steep decline in the u.k. pound as relatively likely following the referendum . <p> the impact on other u.k. assets , such as equities , was harder to quantify , the central bank said . <p> carney added that it was a fair assumption that international financial markets would suffer negative spillovers from a brexit . he said this was the no. 1 issue raised when he met with fellow central bank governors , foreign ministers and heads of major international corporations , banks and asset management firms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to negative spillovers : boe carney <p> cnbc 's geoff cutmore asks bank of england governor , mark carney about the global repercussions that could take effect , in the event that the u.k. chooses to leave the european union . <h> further easing ? <p> the fallout from a brexit vote could be such that the bank introduces new monetary easing measures . these could include quantitative easing , credit easing or additional liquidity facilities for banks , carney said on thursday . <p> he added that the brexit referendum posed a more serious economic risk than 2014 's scottish independence vote . <p> \" the issues around scotland principally affected financial stability in the short-term ... these were issues that we took seriously ... but they were not issues that at the time , in the judgement of the mpc , rose to the level of being the biggest risk to the economic outlook to the u.k. , \" carney said . <p> he denied the bank was breaching its political independence by setting out the risks of leaving the eu . <p> \" we are providing information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives a sense of the major risk , \" carney said . <h> rates seen lower for longer <p> the bank of england held its forecast for consumer inflation at 0.4 percent for the second quarter of 2016 -- far below the targeted 2.0 percent . <p> \" this shortfall is due predominately to unusually large drags from energy and food prices , which are expected to fade over the next year , \" the bank said in its summary of the mpc meeting . <p> it cut its forecast for the second quarter of 2017 to 1.5 percent from 1.6 percent and held its estimate for second quarter 2018 at 2.1 percent . inflation is seen at 2.2 percent in the second quarter of 2019 . <p> the bank now sees its base rate remaining at 0.5 percent until the second quarter of 2017 at the earliest , having previously forecast the rate would reach 0.6 percent by then . it also cut its predicted rate for the second quarter of 2018 to 0.6 percent from 0.9 percent . <p> external forecasters are more bullish , forecasting the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 and 1.3 percent by the same period in 2018 , according to the bank of england .

Larry Hogan said Thursday he 's \" very pleased \" with the decision of the state 's school construction chief to resign amid the ongoing battle over school air conditioning in Baltimore city and county . <p> David Lever has headed the Interagency Committee on School Construction , a state agency that reviews school construction projects and spending , since 2003 . <p> On Wednesday , Lever criticized the vote by Hogan and Comptroller Peter Franchot on the Board of Public Works to withhold $15 million from Baltimore city and county school systems unless they install portable air conditioners in schools over the summer . <p> Lever said the decision politicized school construction funding and prompted his decision to step down , effective in September . <p> Hogan said he 's glad to see him go . <p> At a news conference in Annapolis , the Republican governor called Lever \" a major part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with his resignation , \" Hogan said . \" My only regret is it does n't take effect immediately . <p> \" Quite frankly , anyone who has the arrogance and the sense of entitlement that they do n't feel like they have to be accountable for their actions to the Board of Public Works , to the people who are responsible for overseeing these things , does n't deserve to be working in state government , \" Hogan said . <p> Lever declined to comment on the governor 's remarks . \" I do n't have any response to that , \" he said . <p> Hogan 's statement came as politicians continued a war of words over school air-conditioning policies . <p> Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz , a Democrat , issued a lengthy statement defending his position that installing portable air conditioners would be a poor use of taxpayer dollars compared to his plan to install central air conditioning in all schools by 2019 . <p> The state Board of Public Works has voted to hold back millions of dollars in school construction money from Baltimore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classrooms by the start of the next school year . <p> \" In his desire to punish Baltimore County and Baltimore City , the Governor intentionally misstated the county 's plan , refused multiple opportunities to be presented with the facts , and disregarded the clear legal advice of the Attorney General of the State of Maryland , \" Kamenetz wrote . <p> County officials say it 's logistically impossible to install air conditioners by the deadline set by Hogan and Franchot of the start of the next school year . <p> Kevin Smith , chief administrative and operating officer for the county school system , said state procurement laws outline steps for a project of this scale . The earliest the process could be completed is August 2017 , he said , if it started immediately . <p> The system would have to hire a consultant to design the work and have plans approved by the state , Interagency Committee on School Construction , which could take until fall .

No doubt he 'll have even more excuses next week . \" <p> Peter Hamm , a spokesman for Franchot , also dismissed the county 's timetable , saying of Kamenetz : \" If he wants to make it that hard , he can make it that hard . \" <p> Baltimore city and county are the only jurisdictions in the state with a significant number of classrooms that lack air conditioning . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 175 public school buildings lacked air conditioning . In Baltimore , 76 schools lack air conditioning . <p> Hogan and Franchot have criticized leaders of both jurisdictions for not providing air conditioning for classrooms . Franchot , a Democrat , went on the \" C4 Show \" on WBAL radio Thursday to continue to blast Kamenetz . <p> \" The foot-dragging by local elected officials for the last five years is a disgrace , \" he said . <p> Franchot said Kamenetz is \" committing a mass dereliction of duty \" by allowing children to attend schools without air conditioning .

He just is n't that fast or big either . <p> They 're not worried about that , though . Not now . They got a place to work and in this place , guys like them can stick . <p> \" Right now , it 's like Coach Belichick always says , ' It does n't matter about how you get here , it matters what you do when you get here ' , and right now I 'm just enjoying every opportunity and chance that I can have , \" said Bentley . <p> Asked about Butler , Bentley said , \" All the guys serve as inspiration to me .

Hartford Superior Court Judge Carl E.

He said she was happy and energetic and took great pride in her daughter and her grandson . <p> \" Alex is not fit to live in society , \" Ortega said . \" He needs to live the rest of his life behind bars . \" <p> Prosecutor Anne Mahoney told the judge that she made the plea offer of 32 years in prison in exchange for a guilty plea to murder because of the uncertainty of a trial .

        "text":"<p> As the copyright infringement lawsuit between Spirit and Led Zeppelin gets closer to its trial date , the defendants continue to fight back . Today ( May 24 ) , lawyers for Led Zeppelin suggested that Spirit are \" playing to the press \" and \" tainting the jury pool . \" <p> The Hollywood Reporter quotes a brief filed that reads , \" Plaintiff 's motion is a PR stunt in the hope of tainting the jury pool . Despite being told that Jimmy Page , Robert Plant and John Paul Jones fully intend to appear at the trial , plaintiff 's counsel misrepresented to the Court at the April 25 , 2016 Pretrial Conference that Messrs . Page , Plant and Jones ' are refusing to appear in this court in the claims against them , ' and plaintiff 's counsel repeated that misrepresentation to news cameras on the Courthouse steps , causing a flurry of press reports repeating plaintiff 's false accusation . When those reports died down , plaintiff triggered renewed reports of his misrepresentation by now filing a belated motion that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing to the press . \" <p> Although a U.S. District Judge 's ruling last month removed the last hurdle for the case to go to trial , Led Zeppelin 's lawyers once again voiced their opposition to the case , adding , \" There simply is no merit to plaintiff 's attempt to pursue a 45-year-old claim that the actual copyright owner and Randy Wolfe never bothered to file . \" <p> The estate of Randy Wolfe , whose stage name was Randy California , and former Spirit bassist Mark Andes are suing Led Zeppelin on the grounds that the introduction to \" Stairway to Heaven \" is very similar to their song , \" Taurus , \" that appeared on Spirit 's 1968 debut . Led Zeppelin 's first U.S. concert was as Spirit 's opening act . The plaintiff 's lawyers have said that they would be willing to settle the case for $1 and a share of the songwriting royalties .

        "text":"<p> By now we all know the story of Nick U'Ren , the Warriors lackey who , during last year 's Finals , famously suggested to the team 's coaching staff that they start Andre Iguodala for the first time all season . It was a feel-good anecdote to take away from a Finals that at times bordered on nihilistic -- a perfect bow on top of a magical , fairytale season . <p> But perhaps more importantly , the story of U'Ren 's helped foster the idea that the Warriors as a franchise were just different from the rest of the NBA . This thesis would later be spelled out by team co-owner Joe Lacob in a New York Times Magazine cover story in which he said his organization was \" light-years ahead \" of the rest of the league . <p> Steve Kerr was probably just being a good boss when he dropped U'Ren 's name in a press conference after Golden State flipped the series with a win in Game 4 , but the residual effect of the U'Ren story becoming public was a deepening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warriors ' owner , general manager , coach , and players smarter than yours , but their ballboy is , too . And like every great Silicon Valley companies , the franchise is a meritocracy , where the best ideas float to the top , no matter where they originated . <p> Advertisement <p> It did n't really matter that what U'Ren proposed was far from radical . As he explained to Tim Kawakami recently , the Warriors had used their now-vaunted Death Lineup during the 2014-2015 regular season , and had observed its prowess . U'Ren merely suggested that they begin the game with it . Anyway , it might not have mattered had Draymond Green and Stephen Curry not unclenched their sphincters , or had David Lee not risen from the crypt , or had Andre Igoudala not made a long succession of jumpers he often misses , or had LeBron James -- many months before the creation of the Mr. Krabs meme -- not suddenly found himself throwing court-warping passes to James Jones and Mike Miller . <p> Rarely does one key unlock a championship . The Warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cute story . Then , this season , the Death Lineup started ravaging the league , turning the Warriors into a traveling circus poised to break an unbreakable record and , well , you can probably understand why they started getting high on their own supply . <p> Sponsored <p> This brings us , unexpectedly , to James Michael McAdoo . McAdoo was a five-star recruit out of high school with impeccable genes . He chose to attend UNC , where he was kind of a bust . He went undrafted , but the Warriors liked him just enough to shuttle him between their D-League team in Santa Cruz and the end of the bench in Oakland . He picked up some garbage time scraps , averaging six-and-a-half minutes played across 41 games , shooting roughly twice per game . He was about as important to the Warriors ' historic season as the hot dog vendor . <p> And then , all of a sudden , after being left inactive for much of the playoffs , McAdoo was jogging onto the floor in this year 's thrillingly well-played Game 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavs before inevitably clinching their second straight championship at home in a game that would be a mere coronation for a budding dynasty that could go down as one of the NBA 's greatest . McAdoo made a few good plays , scoring at the rim once and dishing to Shaun Livingston for a layup . Curry , Klay Thompson , and Harrison Barnes rained down threes , Iguodala played cephalopodic defense , and that was that . <p> But what McAdoo did on the court was less important than the fact that Kerr unsheathed him in the first place -- a magician unveiling his boldest trick yet . You could feel the reverence for the Warriors ' sorcery when , through some sort of clerical error or trickery , McAdoo was initially announced as the replacement for the suspended Green in the Game 5 starting lineup . The Warriors were set to make the Cavs disappear on live TV once again , and this time the degree of difficulty was going to blow your mind . <p> Alas , you know what happened . With Draymond watching the game from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineup , and the Warriors got carved up by LeBron James and Kyrie Irving , both of whom had unusually hot jumpers but also encountered little resistance at the basket . McAdoo played eight minutes , picking up two rebounds and three fouls . He did n't shoot once . He was what we thought he was : an athletic but green big man who can shuffle his feet but who ca n't really shoot or score or protect the rim . In his eight minutes on the court , the Warriors were outscored by 10 points . <p> Advertisement <p> It 's fine for James Michael McAdoo to be useless . He 's 23 and has barely played in the NBA . But that he carried the implication of being this year 's sequel to last year 's checkmate -- ? for even just a moment -- means that we , just like Joe Lacob himself , have the Warriors fucked up . They are not wizards . They can not see into the future . They are ? reaching desperately ? to plug leaks , like every team must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible basketball players , but James Michael McAdoo is n't one of them . He is n't saving anyone from anything . ",

        "title":"Brands: Learn the Language to Get the Most Out of Social\n",
        "text":"<h> Brands : Learn the Language to Get the Most Out of Social <p> The rise of digital , and social media in particular , has opened loads of new pathways for brands and consumers to connect , with even more platforms continuing to emerge . But the nature of these new channels has changed the way brands and consumers connect and , therefore , it comes with a whole new set of rules . <p> Luckily , the common denominator is pretty simple : Be human . OK , to be fair , brands ca n't really be human , and proposing that they could be shows no respect to humanity . So what 's a brand to do ? Being self-aware enough to understand your role in the conversation is a good place to start . Here are some things to keep in mind : <h> It 's not about you <p> With social media in particular , people use it to escape , even if only for a few moments . They escape by connecting with their friends , or people they wish were their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important to keep that in mind when you try to interject . We 've all met some jerk at a party who keeps interrupting and trying to change the topic of conversation to themselves . No one likes that jerk , so do n't be that jerk . <h> Add something valuable <p> Ever been in a group conversation with someone who keeps chiming in , always a little off-topic , and it seems like they do n't quite get what 's going on , but they desperately want to be included ? You do n't want to be that poor wretch , either . Spend some time listening to the conversations that are happening , and ask yourself honestly if you have something valuable to add . No , truly stop and ask yourself : If I were talking with my friend about x , and someone else interjected with y , would I appreciate it , or get annoyed ? Now think about how you want users to feel about your brand . <h> Listen before speaking <p> Every digital channel , just like every conversation , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs are often fluid and may not be immediately apparent to an outsider . At first glance , Snapchat is all about video . So would a cut-down of a highly produced broadcast spot make sense there ? No , it would n't . Pay attention to the nuance of the language . <p> Another example : People are communicating with emojis everywhere , but does it make sense for your brand to use emojis ? Does it come naturally ? Do you know all of the double-entendres associated with your chosen emoji ? Spend some time watching and listening to get to know the local customs before you inadvertently make a faux pas . Credibility is your brand 's backbone : Do n't risk it over something silly . <h> Mind your manners <p> If you 're noticing a pattern here , it 's that these are all basically ground rules for partaking in civilized conversation . This sometimes requires sensitivity . As much as a brand wants to find a relevant way to join conversations , it 's equally important to know when to shut up . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's passing or national disaster . Even if the sentiment is kind , too often it comes off as opportunistic and tacky . Sometimes the best way to show respect is by staying silent . <h> Be yourself <p> Every other item on this list is about understanding others , but all is for naught if you do n't understand yourself . Every brand has something honest and valuable to offer , and that 's what you should be talking about .

        "lower_text":"<h> brands : learn the language to get the most out of social <p> the rise of digital , and social media in particular , has opened loads of new pathways for brands and consumers to connect , with even more platforms continuing to emerge . but the nature of these new channels has changed the way brands and consumers connect and , therefore , it comes with a whole new set of rules . <p> luckily , the common denominator is pretty simple : be human . ok , to be fair , brands ca n't really be human , and proposing that they could be shows no respect to humanity . so what 's a brand to do ? being self-aware enough to understand your role in the conversation is a good place to start . here are some things to keep in mind : <h> it 's not about you <p> with social media in particular , people use it to escape , even if only for a few moments . they escape by connecting with their friends , or people they wish were their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important to keep that in mind when you try to interject . we 've all met some jerk at a party who keeps interrupting and trying to change the topic of conversation to themselves . no one likes that jerk , so do n't be that jerk . <h> add something valuable <p> ever been in a group conversation with someone who keeps chiming in , always a little off-topic , and it seems like they do n't quite get what 's going on , but they desperately want to be included ? you do n't want to be that poor wretch , either . spend some time listening to the conversations that are happening , and ask yourself honestly if you have something valuable to add . no , truly stop and ask yourself : if i were talking with my friend about x , and someone else interjected with y , would i appreciate it , or get annoyed ? now think about how you want users to feel about your brand . <h> listen before speaking <p> every digital channel , just like every conversation , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs are often fluid and may not be immediately apparent to an outsider . at first glance , snapchat is all about video . so would a cut-down of a highly produced broadcast spot make sense there ? no , it would n't . pay attention to the nuance of the language . <p> another example : people are communicating with emojis everywhere , but does it make sense for your brand to use emojis ? does it come naturally ? do you know all of the double-entendres associated with your chosen emoji ? spend some time watching and listening to get to know the local customs before you inadvertently make a faux pas . credibility is your brand 's backbone : do n't risk it over something silly . <h> mind your manners <p> if you 're noticing a pattern here , it 's that these are all basically ground rules for partaking in civilized conversation . this sometimes requires sensitivity . as much as a brand wants to find a relevant way to join conversations , it 's equally important to know when to shut up . no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's passing or national disaster . even if the sentiment is kind , too often it comes off as opportunistic and tacky . sometimes the best way to show respect is by staying silent . <h> be yourself <p> every other item on this list is about understanding others , but all is for naught if you do n't understand yourself . every brand has something honest and valuable to offer , and that 's what you should be talking about . because all of this is really about making connections based on common values , and if you 're true to yourself , the people who share your values will take notice . <p> when you 're planning a social campaign or any sort of communication on the web , keep these things in mind . remember that your brand will never be human , but a little situational and self-awareness goes a long way toward ensuring that people can connect with you on a human level . <p> ethan martin is the director of user strategy at digital agency bukwild . <h> subscribe to adweek <h> featured courses <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and digital outreachlearn more &gt;digital content strategyapply your editorial skills to create an effective content strategylearn more &gt;copywriting for social mediamaximize your clicks , shares , retweets , and pinlearn more &gt;skills in 60 : how to name your brand or productdevelop a unique name for any brand , product , or businesslearn more &gt;see more courses &gt; ",

We 're going to be okay . <p> Does this count as a SPOILER ALERT ? Maybe , if knowing the year of a CG background prop will kill your enjoyment of a talking fish movie . So , you 're warned . <p> I took my son to see the fish-based movie ( he 's fond of all sorts of fish-related entertainment ; an all-cod production of Man of La Mancha delighted him ) and noticed a prominent cameo of an old Beetle patiently soaking on the ocean floor . <p> Advertisement <p> Once I saw it , I knew the global public had a right to know what year that Beetle was , and , ideally , what model . I could n't let them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with envy at those preening bastards who can identify the year of any classic ... Read more Read more <p> The Beetle is shown twice ; first from the rear , and then , in the post-credit sequence after the movie , from the front-quarter . The rear shot gave me a lot of crucial data , but I was n't able to confirm until I saw the front . After processing both images through my dedicated VW Identificatron 2100 ( made from an Odyssey 2 connected to a bunch of flea collars wired in parallel , for image processing ) , I had my answer : <p> It 's a 1962 Beetle , a 1200 Standard ( non-export ) model . <p> Now , I need to explain why I think it 's a 1962 instead of a 1963 . The rear shot clearly established it as a ' 62 or ' 63 -- it has the three-chamber all-red taillights and the smaller , inverted cup-like license plate light . That combination only existed in 1962 or 1963 . <p> In the front , the visual difference is the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While that crest is absent here , I noted that the chrome strip on the hood seems a bit too short to reach all the way to the hood handle , suggesting a gap that once could have housed the small crest . That 's why I think this one is a ' 62 , just missing its crest after all those years in the deep . Some crab is probably wearing it like a pendant . <p> Advertisement <p> As far as the model goes , I know it 's a non-export 1200 Beetle because the bumpers lack the ' towel rail ' overriders of the export cars . So , I suspect this bit of ocean floor is well outside US territorial waters . <p> As far as how it ended up there , I have no idea . But , since Beetles have been known to float , at least for a bit , the range of where an ocean-going Beetle may be is probably a bit larger than for most other cars . ",

        "text":"<p> Different points of view are valuable when discussing any event or describing an object . Sure , you might have your own analysis , but somebody else is going to have seen something different . By combining all angles , a clearer picture emerges . <p> The same concept can be seen in a recent MIT study that found a cluster of three to eight small , \" shoebox-sized satellites \" are more accurate than a traditional , large satellite . Since the smaller satellites have multiple angles , their measurements were around twice as accurate . <p> In a paper set to be published in Acta **31;1398;TOOLONG issue , researchers simulated how accurate a single orbiting satellite with nine sensors can measure albedo , or the amount of light reflected from Earth , versus a cluster . Those measurements were compared with the statistics gathered by NASA Goddard 's Cloud Absorption Radiometer , which can obtain data from thousands of different angles on a single spot . The more satellites were in the cluster , the more accurate the measurements . <p> Advertisement <p> It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth is a three-dimensional object and has multiple angles of its own . In order to measure anything , you 'd need more than just a front-facing image . <p> \" The Earth does not reflect equally in all directions , \" said research leader Sreeja Nag . \" If you do n't get these multiple angles , you might under- or overestimate how much it 's reflecting , if you have to extrapolate from just one direction . \" <p> Sponsored <p> This is also useful if a researcher has to deal with a faulty satellite . If one of the pieces in a cluster fails , there will be others to provide backup . If you lose one solo satellite , you run the risk of losing all information . It 's the same in any team : if someone calls out sick , you 'll have someone to take over any workload . <p> More importantly , researchers emphasize that providing more accurate measurements of Earth will help in the fight against climate change . By providing better estimates , scientists can calculate long-term trends and projections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the biggest uncertainties in climate change , because it is a complex function of where on Earth you are , what season it is , what time of day it is , and it 's very difficult to ascertain how much heat leaves the Earth ... If we can estimate the reflectance of different surface types , globally , frequently , and more accurately , which a cluster of satellites would let you do , then at least you 've solved one part of the climate puzzle . \" <p> To replace every satellite with a cluster would be too expensive , but Nag suggests at least using them in cases where satellites need to hold a strict formation .

        "title":"Is the DNC Hack an Act of War-And Are We Prepared to Defend ...\n",
        "text":"<h> Is the DNC Hack an Act of War ? <h> And is the U.S. prepared to defend itself from the foreign powers who would meddle in our elections ? <p> If Russia is behind the DNC hacks , how should we respond ? ( John Kerry and Vladimir Putin in December . ) <p> Mandel Ngan\/AFP\/Getty Images <p> On Monday , the FBI announced that it was investigating the hack into the Democratic National Committee . At about the same time , it was also reported that FBI officials believe that the hack was committed by the Russian government , and was undertaken with the intent of aiding Donald Trump 's presidential campaign . ( The release of the stolen data by WikiLeaks has already caused discord in the Democratic Party on the eve of its convention in Philadelphia ; over the weekend , the chair of the DNC , Debbie Wasserman Schultz , resigned from her post . ) As Franklin Foer reported in Slate , Trump has a long history of cozying up to Russia and its leader , Vladimir Putin . ( Trump recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations if a member state was attacked by Russia . ) And Putin has his own long history of attempting to undermine the West by supporting right-wing candidates . <p> To discuss the DNC hack , I corresponded over email with Jack Goldsmith , a Harvard Law School professor and fellow at Stanford University 's Hoover Institution . A former member of President George W. Bush 's Justice Department , he is also the author of several books on executive power and 21st century warfare . In the course of our discussion , which has been edited and condensed , we discussed the difficulty of assigning responsibility for a cyberattack , the history of countries meddling in foreign elections , and whether Russia is the only American adversary to be worried about . <p> Advertisement <p> Isaac Chotiner : How credible is it that Russia was behind the breach ? <p> Jack Goldsmith : Reports attributing the breach to Russia have been pouring out all day . The New York Times said that private researchers had concluded that this hack was done by the same Russian intelligence services that recently breached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the emails indicated that documents passed through Russian computers . Other news services have said the FBI suspects the Russians . I have no basis to question these reports . But the truth is that there is no public evidence whatsoever tying Russia to the hack . Attribution for cyberoperations of this sort is very tricky and tends to take some time . Even if the hack can be linked to computers in Russia , that does not show that the hack originated there ( as opposed to being routed through there ) . And even if it originated in Russia it does not show who was responsible . That said , it would not be surprising if the Russians were behind this . In addition to today 's reports , the director of national intelligence warned months ago about intrusions into campaign networks , and Russian intelligence services and criminal networks have reportedly infiltrated important U.S government networks in the last year . But to repeat , there is no public evidence yet -- all we have are reports by private firms and anonymous government officials . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? <p> It depends on what you mean by \" this kind of thing . \" One of the first ever CIA covert operations was designed to influence the Italian elections of 1948 to ensure that the Communists did not win , and there are several now-public examples of U.S. covert operations to influence foreign elections over the years . The United States is also a global leader in espionage and data theft in foreign governmental networks . And all major powers , including the United States , engage in information operations in various contexts . Note that a few months ago Putin attributed the Panama Papers disclosures to the United States : \" We now know from WikiLeaks that officials and state agencies in the United States are behind all this . \" <p> Advertisement <p> Is the election aspect of this hack unique ? <p> There have been reports in recent years of cyberattacks or cyberoperations in computer networks in other countries related to elections . Still , if this if a Russian ( or some other foreign governmental ) operation , I know of nothing parallel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I wrote this morning , \" the Russian hack of the DNC was small beans compared to the destruction of the integrity of a national election result . \" Presumably the DNC email hack and leak involve genuine emails . But what if the hackers interspersed fake but even more damning or inflammatory emails that were hard to disprove ? What if hackers break in to computers to steal or destroy voter registration information ? What if they disrupted computer-based voting or election returns in important states during the presidential election ? The legitimacy of a presidential election might be called into question , with catastrophic consequences . The DNC hack is just the first wave of possible threats to electoral integrity in the United States -- by foreign intelligence services , and others . <p> How should we respond ? <p> Very hard question to answer at this point . One needs to have a better handle on the facts before even speculating . <p> Advertisement <p> Are there dangerous escalation scenarios that have you worried ? <p> There are always dangerous escalation scenarios in the cyber context because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the unintended second- and third-order consequences of cyberattacks . It 's too hard to even speculate at this point . <p> How high would a problem like this go in the executive branch in terms of deciding what to do going forward ? <p> An allegation that a major adversary has intervened to disrupt the American presidential election is the most serious of issues and will certainly be discussed in the Oval Office and the Situation Room . Whether the allegation of Russian involvement is true or false , it has huge domestic implications and potentially large foreign policy implications ( in Europe , Syria , etc . ) . <p> Advertisement <p> How seriously do you think the government takes issues of cyberwarfare ? Do you feel confident about our defensive capabilities and competence ? <p> \" Cyberwar \" is a misleading term -- the Russian hack , if it is that , is not an act of war , at least not by traditional standards . It is closer to an intelligence operation with the twist of a damaging publication of the stolen information . That said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its major public and private institutions very seriously . My confidence about our defensive capabilities and competence depends on what institutions you are talking about . Today , some components of the government ( e.g. the Defense Department ) do better than others ( e.g. the Office of Personnel Management , which recently suffered an very damaging hack ) . And private sector defenses , even of important critical infrastructure networks , are a very mixed bag . The scale of the challenge is enormous , and offense has many advantages over defense .

        "lower_text":"<h> is the dnc hack an act of war ? <h> and is the u.s. prepared to defend itself from the foreign powers who would meddle in our elections ? <p> if russia is behind the dnc hacks , how should we respond ? ( john kerry and vladimir putin in december . ) <p> mandel ngan\/afp\/getty images <p> on monday , the fbi announced that it was investigating the hack into the democratic national committee . at about the same time , it was also reported that fbi officials believe that the hack was committed by the russian government , and was undertaken with the intent of aiding donald trump 's presidential campaign . ( the release of the stolen data by wikileaks has already caused discord in the democratic party on the eve of its convention in philadelphia ; over the weekend , the chair of the dnc , debbie wasserman schultz , resigned from her post . ) as franklin foer reported in slate , trump has a long history of cozying up to russia and its leader , vladimir putin . ( trump recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations if a member state was attacked by russia . ) and putin has his own long history of attempting to undermine the west by supporting right-wing candidates . <p> to discuss the dnc hack , i corresponded over email with jack goldsmith , a harvard law school professor and fellow at stanford university 's hoover institution . a former member of president george w. bush 's justice department , he is also the author of several books on executive power and 21st century warfare . in the course of our discussion , which has been edited and condensed , we discussed the difficulty of assigning responsibility for a cyberattack , the history of countries meddling in foreign elections , and whether russia is the only american adversary to be worried about . <p> advertisement <p> isaac chotiner : how credible is it that russia was behind the breach ? <p> jack goldsmith : reports attributing the breach to russia have been pouring out all day . the new york times said that private researchers had concluded that this hack was done by the same russian intelligence services that recently breached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the emails indicated that documents passed through russian computers . other news services have said the fbi suspects the russians . i have no basis to question these reports . but the truth is that there is no public evidence whatsoever tying russia to the hack . attribution for cyberoperations of this sort is very tricky and tends to take some time . even if the hack can be linked to computers in russia , that does not show that the hack originated there ( as opposed to being routed through there ) . and even if it originated in russia it does not show who was responsible . that said , it would not be surprising if the russians were behind this . in addition to today 's reports , the director of national intelligence warned months ago about intrusions into campaign networks , and russian intelligence services and criminal networks have reportedly infiltrated important u.s government networks in the last year . but to repeat , there is no public evidence yet -- all we have are reports by private firms and anonymous government officials . <p> how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? <p> it depends on what you mean by \" this kind of thing . \" one of the first ever cia covert operations was designed to influence the italian elections of 1948 to ensure that the communists did not win , and there are several now-public examples of u.s. covert operations to influence foreign elections over the years . the united states is also a global leader in espionage and data theft in foreign governmental networks . and all major powers , including the united states , engage in information operations in various contexts . note that a few months ago putin attributed the panama papers disclosures to the united states : \" we now know from wikileaks that officials and state agencies in the united states are behind all this . \" <p> advertisement <p> is the election aspect of this hack unique ? <p> there have been reports in recent years of cyberattacks or cyberoperations in computer networks in other countries related to elections . still , if this if a russian ( or some other foreign governmental ) operation , i know of nothing parallel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as i wrote this morning , \" the russian hack of the dnc was small beans compared to the destruction of the integrity of a national election result . \" presumably the dnc email hack and leak involve genuine emails . but what if the hackers interspersed fake but even more damning or inflammatory emails that were hard to disprove ? what if hackers break in to computers to steal or destroy voter registration information ? what if they disrupted computer-based voting or election returns in important states during the presidential election ? the legitimacy of a presidential election might be called into question , with catastrophic consequences . the dnc hack is just the first wave of possible threats to electoral integrity in the united states -- by foreign intelligence services , and others . <p> how should we respond ? <p> very hard question to answer at this point . one needs to have a better handle on the facts before even speculating . <p> advertisement <p> are there dangerous escalation scenarios that have you worried ? <p> there are always dangerous escalation scenarios in the cyber context because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling the unintended second- and third-order consequences of cyberattacks . it 's too hard to even speculate at this point . <p> how high would a problem like this go in the executive branch in terms of deciding what to do going forward ? <p> an allegation that a major adversary has intervened to disrupt the american presidential election is the most serious of issues and will certainly be discussed in the oval office and the situation room . whether the allegation of russian involvement is true or false , it has huge domestic implications and potentially large foreign policy implications ( in europe , syria , etc . ) . <p> advertisement <p> how seriously do you think the government takes issues of cyberwarfare ? do you feel confident about our defensive capabilities and competence ? <p> \" cyberwar \" is a misleading term -- the russian hack , if it is that , is not an act of war , at least not by traditional standards . it is closer to an intelligence operation with the twist of a damaging publication of the stolen information . that said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its major public and private institutions very seriously . my confidence about our defensive capabilities and competence depends on what institutions you are talking about . today , some components of the government ( e.g. the defense department ) do better than others ( e.g. the office of personnel management , which recently suffered an very damaging hack ) . and private sector defenses , even of important critical infrastructure networks , are a very mixed bag . the scale of the challenge is enormous , and offense has many advantages over defense . i do n't know anyone who is sanguine about our defensive capabilities overall . <p> top comment <p> by all means , let 's defend the right of our political parties and candidates to be corrupt and remain undetected . more ... <p> is the sense that russia is the only adversary doing things like this ?

        "text":"<p> Phil Scott likes to tell people how , about 20 years ago now , he did not have a political bone in his body . He grew up in Barre and spent his adult life building a family , a career as a contractor , and a reputation as a race car driver . He takes great pride in his blue-collar roots . <p> But when he started to see politics miring the Legislature , he decided to step up . <p> That trajectory ? serving in the Senate and then as lieutenant governor ? has forced him to become the leader he felt Vermont needed then ? and now . <p> On Aug. 9 , he appears on the Republican ballot with primary challenger Bruce Lisman to be the state ? s next governor . <p> ? I certainly have lived a different life than many , ? Scott , who turns 57 this week , said during an interview at The Times Argus offices last week . <p> He pointed to working 30-plus years as a small-business owner , spending many sleepless nights worrying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has forced me to have a frugal , common-sense approach , ? Scott said . <p> The Republican , known for his moderate views that closely mirror the demeanor and policies of former governor James Douglas , has always served in the minority in Montpelier . <p> ? I have been slugging it out in the trenches . ? But I have known I wanted to be part of the solution , ? he said . Scott said he has done that by reaching out to Democrats , independents and progressives at the State House when it came to building coalitions . He said he has always made a point of listening to others , because ? no one person ever has all the ideas. ? <p> ? I ? ve been able to build consensus . I have the respect and trust of others . And I think you lead by example , ? he said , adding that he is glad he can say he is a safe-and-steady politician . ? I think people appreciate my independence , my follow-through . ? I am not one to over-promise. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult fiscal and infrastructure challenges ? <p> ? I want to provide for a much more affordable Vermont , ? he said . ? I believe a more vibrant economy will lift all boats ? taxes will go down . We will provide more resources for all of those who need services . ? ( Being governor ) has not always been an aspiration , but I believe it is a calling today. ? <p> Scott maintains the state is having an ? affordability crisis ? that is affecting many public policy sectors , as well as the economy . <p> ? Expectations are far outweighing our ability to pay , ? he explained . ? We are having a crisis of affordability right here in Vermont. ? <p> He said it would be imperative to look at the state ? s economy over the previous year and examine what has grown ; then , set a cap that corresponds to that growth before building the budget . From there , Scott said , he would go through a prioritization process that looked at both the budget , cuts and savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in their businesses They expect the state to do the same , ? he said . ? It ? s not easy . But we can live within our means , and send that message to Vermonters . ? It will go a long way toward our recovery. ? <p> Scott says he would form a committee to look at ways to modernize and make efficient the various departments of state government . ? We should always look for ways to save money . There are ample ways to look for savings. ? <p> Scott looks upon Gov . Peter Shumlin ? s administration as having taken too many risks at the expense of Vermonters , especially when it came to Vermont Health Connect . Critics of the Democratic governor characterized many of his initiatives as ? experiments. ? <p> Scott is less condemning in his rhetoric and criticism of Shumlin but does point to what he sees as an overarching problem that the next governor will certainly face . <p> ? We need to restore the faith and trust in government across the board , ? Scott said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insists that has to happen through coalition-building , partnerships , thinking outside the box , and taking measured , tactful steps forward . <p> ? Vermonters deserve that right now , ? he said . <p> ? We often get caught up sometimes in adding and plugging all of the holes . We need to be more efficient . ... I am confident there are ample opportunities to do things differently . It comes down to ways in which we are treating our businesses , entities and citizens fairly. ? <p> While Scott has not rolled out specific plans for improving the economy , changing the state ? s demographic ? especially bolstering the age group between 25 and 35 ? and for transportation and other sectors , his stances on many issues on Vermonters ? minds are clear . <p> First and foremost , Scott says , Vermont has to get its economy on track . He says that hinges on attracting and retaining families and businesses . <p> ? We need to be a magnet , ? he said , whether that is keeping students who attend colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks for businesses who want to be here . ? We provide many opportunities for people to come to us , ? he said . ? But we need to keep ( that core ) here , contributing , paying taxes. ? <p> He said an exodus of the workforce between the ages of 25 and 35 has really hurt the state . <p> In the end , he said , it requires a ? culture change. ? <p> ? It ? s become stagnant . ... If they are not in the system , not part of the community , the burden is on the rest of us still standing . We need a climate that is conducive to growth , and make Vermont affordable. ? <p> He has been quoted as saying Vermont needs to increase its population by about 70,000 to 700,000 . <p> ? We need to revitalize , become a magnet , ? he said . ? There are so many things we have to offer , but we have to market it in a different way. ? <p> After the economy , Scott said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemic . <p> ? We have seen this rising addiction issue rising in other states , as well , ? he said , pointing to how the problem is not unique to Vermont . ? It has affected each and every one of us. ? <p> Scott said it has become far too easy to become addicted , in part because he said doctors are over-prescribing certain drugs . <p> The answer , he said , lies in a balance of prevention , treatment and enforcement . <p> In turn , Scott said Vermont needs to re-evaluate how it serves the mentally ill and the pressures that parity issues place on other health-related needs across the spectrum of treatment . <p> He said while Act 46 was not ? something I would have crafted , it has been a great way to start the conversation ? across Vermont when it comes to school consolidation . <p> ? I have been listening to Vermonters screaming for property tax relief for years , ? he said , adding that while he would not ? like his opponent , Bruce Lisman ? call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ? I would support school choice , ? he said , as well as making sure those communities that do want to consolidate are provided with proper incentives . ? We need more carrots than sticks , ? he said . In the end , however , Vermont is educating 20,000 fewer students than 10 years ago and spending $1.6 billion to do so . ? Inaction is not the answer . ? It is necessary to get a handle on the cost of education , ? Scott said . <p> While he is not a supporter of industrial wind , he is a proponent of solar and renewables . In particular , he said as governor he would open new partnerships with Canada to tap into hydro-electric resources there that would ? meet our needs just fine. ? <p> He is not in favor of a carbon tax . ? It raises the cost of living throughout . I am looking for make Vermont more affordable , ? he said . <p> And when it comes to health care reform , Scott has been critical of Vermont Health Connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw proof it worked , he would not get behind the governor ? s plan . Scott stood by that claim . <p> ? I would pull the plug on Vermont Health Connect , ? he said , adding that he would opt to switch to the federal exchange but carry over pieces and parts of the system that might be working . Scott said he would look to other states , like Hawaii , Maryland , Oregon and Connecticut , that have cobbled together a health care exchange for far less than what Vermont is spending . <p> He called Vermont Health Connect a ? failed , ill-conceived IT structure. ? <p> ? I think there are ways out there that can work for us , too , ? he said . <p> Does Vermont need more restrictions on gun purchases ? ? No , we just need to enforce the laws we have on the books . ?

It is exactly how I envisioned it. ? <p> He said the primary challenge has made him a better candidate . <p> Of Lisman , he said , ? I am disappointed in my opponent , his tone .

        "text":"<p> Vulnerabilities in the Apple iOS sandboxing feature could be exploited by attackers <p> Researchers across three universities have discovered seven classes of vulnerabilities in the sandboxing feature of Apple 's iOS operating system , which if exploited could allow malicious actors to launch a bevy of attacks that would place an iPhone or iPad user 's privacy and data at risk . <p> This sandbox uses a set profile , which Apple refers to as a \" container , \" that acts as an interface for third-party applications , granting each one parameter-based permissions for what actions they can take and what data they can access . It also is designed to confine any malicious or exploited third-party applications . <p> However , academics at North Carolina State University , Germany 's Technische Universitat Darmstadt and Romania 's University Politehnica of Bucharest announced this week that they have found flaws in the sandbox 's code that could allow unscrupulous third-party developers -- or bad actors who have secretly compromised their apps -- to perform multiple unauthorized acts on iOS devices . <p> Specifically , attackers could exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up location search histories , access system file metadata , obtain a user 's name and media library , consume disk storage space ( in such a manner that uninstalling the app wo n't recover it ) , block access to system resources , and allow apps to share information with each other without permission . An NC State press release states that the exploits affect \" nonjailbroken devices running later versions of iOS -- including 9.0.2 , the version that underwent the study . <p> \" Many people think that the closed operating system from Apple is more secure than the open Android system , said Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi , another researcher and professor of computer science at Technische Universitat Darmstadt , in a university press release . To test the validity of this theory , the researchers decided to have a closer look at one of key security features in iOS : the sandbox . \" Our goal was to see if we could automate the detection of security vulnerabilities , \" Sadeghi said . <p> To accomplish this , the researchers created a process called \" SandScout \" to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into readable form , and model it using logic programming language so that they could perform a series of automated queries on the coding , looking for potential abuse scenarios .

Or perhaps they have been granted write access , which \" might cause some corruptions . \" <p> The researchers will flesh out the vulnerabilities in more detail in an upcoming academic research paper , \" SandScout : Automatic Detection of Flaws in iOS Sandbox Profiles , \" which is set for release during the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security , scheduled to take place in Vienna from Oct. 24-28 .

        "text":"<p> A skilled director can make a tense story come to life onscreen . But an unusually good director can make us feel anxious while watching a story we expected to have no drama at all , and Clint Eastwood does that in the low-key , beautifully assembled \" Sully . \" <p> U.S. Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger , now known to the country as Sully , was flying an Airbus from LaGuardia to Charlotte in January 2009 . A flock of geese blasted toward the plane , disabling two engines , and he landed on the Hudson River , getting all 155 people aboard home alive . <p> Warner Bros. bills this biopic as \" The untold story behind the Miracle on the Hudson , \" but they use the wrong preposition . It 's the untold story after the event , when the National Transportation Safety Board questioned Sullenberger 's judgment and threatened to retire him without a pension if the crash could have been averted . <p> Or so it goes in Todd Komarnicki 's script . He adapted \" Highest Duty , \" the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he takes an unadulteratedly favorable view of the protagonist . Though Sully second-guesses his decision once in a while and has bad dreams , someone -- a bartender , his co-pilot ( Aaron Eckhart ) , even his wife ( Laura Linney ) -- is always on hand to remind him he 's a hero . <p> This may sound corny , yet it 's not . Eastwood tells the story cleverly and efficiently ; he weaves in and out of the trial , changing points of view constantly . He first gives us the crash from the air traffic controllers ' side and then , much later , from the cockpit . <p> Hanks maintains a calm demeanor that conceals a racing pulse and troubled mind . We have seen him do this cool-under-fire thing many times , from \" Saving Private Ryan \" to \" Captain Phillips , \" yet he varies these characters subtly .

Cinematographer Tom Stern , who has shot Eastwood 's last 13 features , knows what the boss wants : A subtle color palette that distinguishes between the institutional glare of examination rooms and the pale skies of a January day over New York . <p> Despite its brief running time , the film feels stretched out once or twice , especially when Sully phones his wife . We never see them together ; she 's there to remind us what 's at stake if the NTSB finds him culpable , and the character becomes disposable . <p> On the other hand , the coda that shows the real Chesley and Lorraine Sullenberger visiting the Carolinas Aviation Museum belongs in the picture . It shows us both how closely Hanks impersonated him in looks and demeanor and reminds us what an ordinary guy Sully was , except for that extraordinary four minutes of cool-headed valor . <p> Charlotteans may recognize actor Rob Trevelier as a control tower supervisor , and I heard audience members chuckle when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frisco 's Double Eagle Steak House on Piedmont Row . <p> The real Charlotte-bound passengers show up in the reunion at the Aviation Museum , and almost all have Southern accents -- though nobody on the fictional plane does .

        "text":"<h> posted at 11:01 am on September 13 , 2016 by Ed Morrissey <p> When Ivanka Trump pushed for more government regulation on businesses for family leave at the Republican convention , some wondered whether Donald Trump took it seriously . The answer , according to the Washington Post 's Robert Costa , is apparently yes . Trump will propose six paid weeks of maternity leave , along with child-care tax credits aimed at families earning $500,000 a year or less : <p> A campaign memo shared early Tuesday with The Washington Post shows that Trump 's plan \" will rewrite the tax code to allow working parents to deduct from their income taxes child-care expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents . \" <p> That deduction would be capped at the \" average cost of care \" in the state of residence , and it would not be available to individuals earning more than $250,000 or a couple earning more than $500,000 . ... <p> Another policy proposal will be guaranteeing \" six weeks of paid maternity leave \" through an amendment of current unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give twelve weeks of unpaid maternity leave , allowing new mothers to return to the same position ( or one of similar rank and equal pay ) . That creates a burden on employers already to fill positions temporarily , and the costs are not a wash . If employers have to pay six weeks of salary on top of that , the costs will be enormous . <p> Costa 's description of this proposal sounds like it wo n't be a mandate on employers , at least not directly . Trump may propose to pay benefits through the unemployment insurance system , even though the mothers will still be employed . All that does is shuffle the costs around , because employers already pay unemployment insurance tax on every employee to both the state and federal governments in order to fund unemployment payments . Adding maternity to the conditions that trigger payment will force those taxes upward , and probably sharply . <p> Let 's do the math . In 2014 , the latest period for which the CDC has birth data , the US had 3,988,076 births -- 40% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Using the current labor force participation rate for women ( 56.8% ) , we can estimate that women who are employed had roughly 2.27 million of these births but that figure may really be higher than that , especially given the high percentage of births outside of marriage . The average per-capita income in the US is $28,555 ( 2014 figures , Census Bureau ) , which would amount to $549 per week , or about $3300 for six weeks . The cost of this program would be another $7.5 billion in payouts from the unemployment system each year , on top of the payments already being made for actual unemployment . <p> Now consider the current status of budgets , not just at the federal level but also in each of the states . Almost every state has a looming pension crisis , and the federal budget operates on 40% borrowed money -- on top of having an entitlement-program crisis looming . The system does not have room for another entitlement program , and businesses are already struggling with costs . This program would have to burden employers because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to hurt smaller businesses more because of the realities of the economies of scale . It will be yet another reason for businesses to refrain from hiring as a way to limit their exposure to higher taxes , along with the other employer mandate that came from ObamaCare . <p> When Ivanka highlighted the \" wage gap \" in her speech at the Republican convention , I warned this might be coming : <p> What made this stand out even more was that it was the only issue in which Ivanka went into detail . The other political points raised in her introduction were at the level of my father will fight for you on this . Ivanka spent three of the 22 paragraphs of her speech on this point alone . Clearly , Team Trump understands that they have a steep gender gap to bridge in the general election , and they may have wanted to pre-empt ( or \" triangulate \" ) the issue ahead of next week 's Democratic convention , when Hillary Clinton will ride it hard . To conservatives who already worry about Trump 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kind of government intervention in marketplace decisions that they usually fight Democrats to stop rather than Republicans . <p> This is more than triangulation -- it 's a surrender on the principle of limited government . The tax credits may or may not be wisely configured , but guaranteeing pay will require precisely the government intervention at which Ivanka 's speech hinted . We 're still giving away fantasy money , spending cash that even our grandchildren 's grandchildren have n't yet earned , and now Republicans want to indulge that same Democratic fantasy . ",

You 're Dorne tootin ' . <p> When you play the \" Game of Thrones , \" you win or you get completely tricked by HBO , according to the former ruler of Dorne . <p> Actor Alexander Siddig played Prince Doran Martell in Seasons 5 and 6 . In a recent interview with StarTrek.com , he opened up about the intense secrecy surrounding the show , suggesting the network actively sends out misinformation in order to misdirect fans . He threw out some shocking support for an HBO conspiracy : <p> Last season , I believe that the first few episodes were stolen and downloaded online , and everybody got to see them before the show actually aired , and everybody was furious at HBO and whatnot . I do n't know if you remember . I am almost positive that those four episodes were leaked by HBO themselves . <p> Could HBO have actually leaked the episodes by itself ? \" Game of Thrones \" certainly does n't need episode-by-episode reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the \" leak \" got a ton of free publicity . It might have been a clever PR move . <p> The only thing that does n't fit is why HBO was supposedly tracking down people who had watched the leaked material . That could simply be a cover up , though . <p> Siddig says there is \" an enormous amount of spin going on \" surrounding the show , but he adds that the conspiracy idea is just his own opinion . <p> It makes sense that the actor who plays Prince Doran would be into conspiracies . In the books , his character is busy scheming behind the scenes , which the show did n't allow him time to do . <p> Siddig admits he 's \" not really sure \" why he was killed off so soon ? in the Season 6 premiere . Apparently , the actor was contracted to appear in four episodes of that season ; however , during the phone call in which showrunners told him when his character would die , he learned they had originally planned to kill him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> \" If they were going to kill me off at the end of the last season why would they contract me for those four episodes ? \" asked Siddig . <p> The actor speculates that he might 've been killed off because he said the wrong thing to someone in charge . Sure , that 's possible . From the beginning , though , the Dorne storyline was criticized heavily by fans for less-than-spectacular characters and fight sequences : <p> Yeah , people were n't happy with that . <p> Unlike the leaked episodes , there 's likely no conspiracy for Siddig 's early exit . All disappointing plot lines must die . ",

People want to help veterans , he said . <p> Also , an unintended side benefit is that Operation Honor Guard is raising awareness about honor guards , and that 's been attracting young members , Darby said . The average age of an honor guard member is 77 . <p> The veterans who make up an honor guard give a fallen soldier a dignified , respectful farewell by performing military rites at his or her funeral . They serve in any weather conditions , any time of day , and without compensation . <p> In the past , the members bought their own clothing , and nobody matched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- the fun run and the Day of Giving -- the veterans have been able to buy decent clothing , raincoats , winter jackets , flags , bugles and rifle parts . <p> The American Legion Post 210 has always been able to have a full squad for an honor guard , with about 12-13 people ; about 20 veterans are available . However , many of the members are getting older . <p> Darby said there will always be a need for uniforms and equipment . There are more than 10,000 veterans service organizations ' honor guards in the United States , and each guard has an average of 12 members .
