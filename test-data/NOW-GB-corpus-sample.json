These two sunspots are part of the same system and are over six Earths across <p> Nasa scientists spotted the huge sunspot forming through instruments on the agency 's Solar Dynamics Observatory , one of several spacecraft that monitor the Sun 's weather . <p> ' Over the course of February 19-20 , 2013 , scientists watched a giant sunspot form in under 48 hours , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has grown to over six Earth diameters across but its full extent is hard to judge since the spot lies on a sphere not a flat disk . ' <p> The sunspot identified by Nasa is formed of several dark blemishes on the surface on the Sun which have evolved rapidly over the past couple of days . <h> NASA 'S SUN WATCHER : THE SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY <p> The Solar Dynamics Observatory contains a suite of instruments that will provide observations leading to a more complete understanding of the solar dynamics that drive variability in the Earth 's environment . <p> This set of instruments : <p> Measures the extreme ultraviolet spectral irradiance of the Sun at a rapid cadence <p> Measures the Doppler shifts due to oscillation velocities over the entire visible disk <p> Makes high-resolution measurements of the longitudinal and vector magnetic field over the entire visible disk <p> Makes images of the chromosphere and inner corona at several temperatures at a rapid cadence <p> Makes those measurements over a significant portion of a solar cycle to capture the solar variations that may exist in different time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense magnetic activity and are actually cooler than the rest of the Sun , which leaves them clearly visible as dark spots in the photosphere . <p> In reality , if the sunspot were isolated from the surrounding photosphere it would be brighter than an electric arc . <p> Ms Fox added : ' The spot quickly evolved into what 's called a delta region , in which the lighter areas around the sunspot , the penumbra , exhibit magnetic fields that point in the opposite direction of those fields in the center , dark area . <p> ' This is a fairly unstable configuration that scientists know can lead to eruptions of radiation on the sun called solar flares . ' <p> The observation comes as the Sun is gearing up for the most active phase of its 11-year solar cycle . <p> The Sun 's magnetic field lines are the most distorted at this time due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles . <p> This causes large numbers of sunspots appear , and the Sun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The increased energy output of solar maxima can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns . <p> The solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next , with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle . <p> Large solar flares often occur during a maximum . For example , the Solar storm of 1859 struck the Earth with such intensity the northern lights could be seen as far south as Rome . <p> The last solar maximum was in 2000 . In 2006 NASA initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011 , and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958 . <p> However , more recent projections say the maximum should arrive in autumn of 2013 and be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906.

' <p> the sunspot identified by nasa is formed of several dark blemishes on the surface on the sun which have evolved rapidly over the past couple of days . <h> nasa 's sun watcher : the solar dynamics observatory <p> the solar dynamics observatory contains a suite of instruments that will provide observations leading to a more complete understanding of the solar dynamics that drive variability in the earth 's environment . <p> this set of instruments : <p> measures the extreme ultraviolet spectral irradiance of the sun at a rapid cadence <p> measures the doppler shifts due to oscillation velocities over the entire visible disk <p> makes high-resolution measurements of the longitudinal and vector magnetic field over the entire visible disk <p> makes images of the chromosphere and inner corona at several temperatures at a rapid cadence <p> makes those measurements over a significant portion of a solar cycle to capture the solar variations that may exist in different time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense magnetic activity and are actually cooler than the rest of the sun , which leaves them clearly visible as dark spots in the photosphere . <p> in reality , if the sunspot were isolated from the surrounding photosphere it would be brighter than an electric arc . <p> ms fox added : ' the spot quickly evolved into what 's called a delta region , in which the lighter areas around the sunspot , the penumbra , exhibit magnetic fields that point in the opposite direction of those fields in the center , dark area . <p> ' this is a fairly unstable configuration that scientists know can lead to eruptions of radiation on the sun called solar flares . ' <p> the observation comes as the sun is gearing up for the most active phase of its 11-year solar cycle . <p> the sun 's magnetic field lines are the most distorted at this time due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles . <p> this causes large numbers of sunspots appear , and the sun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased energy output of solar maxima can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns . <p> the solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next , with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle . <p> large solar flares often occur during a maximum . for example , the solar storm of 1859 struck the earth with such intensity the northern lights could be seen as far south as rome . <p> the last solar maximum was in 2000 . in 2006 nasa initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011 , and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958 . <p> however , more recent projections say the maximum should arrive in autumn of 2013 and be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906.

"text": "<h> Why Happiness Should Be a Global Priority <p> This Wednesday sees the very first United Nations International Day of Happiness , which is being celebrated around the world on 20 March . This follows a recent resolution adopted by all members of the UN General Assembly calling for happiness to be given a greater priority . So why are people now taking happiness so seriously at national and global levels ? <p> Happiness means the quality of life as each person experiences it . This is a key outcome in itself and is an important measure of success for any country , regardless of the level of economic development . It tells us whether people are leading lives they find satisfying and fulfilling . So information on the causes of happiness helps policy-makers to choose policy goals that serve the real needs of their people . <p> But , in addition , happiness is a major determinant of the other goals that policy-makers care about . Personal resilience predicts educational performance better than IQ does ; and higher wellbeing improves work performance and workers ' earnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work , 40% of time off work and 40% of disability . Their overall cost amounts to some 10% of GDP . Greater happiness increases life expectancy ; by contrast depression reduces life expectancy as much as smoking does . So happiness is a major contributor to many of our most important social goals . <p> As a result of 30 years of research , we now know a lot about what affects happiness . The main influences are economic , personal/social and environmental . On the economic front , income is important in every country , and poverty is a major source of unhappiness . But it is not the only thing that matters . In most countries income explains less than 2% of the overall variance in happiness ( the other identifiable factors explain about 20% ) . Across countries , income differences explain about 6% of the differences in average happiness , while social factors explain a great deal more . Work is also vital for happiness and its importance goes well beyond the income which it provides . Education is also important , largely as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Turning to personal/social determinants of happiness , the most important in developed countries is mental health . In these countries it accounts for 40% of all illness ( weighted by severity ) - more than heart disease , cancer , lung disease and diabetes all combined . It is also largely a disease of working age so that it has massive economic consequences , while physical illness is more concentrated in later life . In poorer countries by contrast physical illness has major impacts at every age but mental illness remains an equally important cause of low wellbeing . <p> Another crucial determinant of happiness is the quality of human relationships - above all in the family but also in the community and at work . Secure employment is vital for those who want to work and personal security against violence is vital for everyone . Good governance is essential too - wellbeing studies show the corrosive effect of corruption , and the crucial role of personal freedom and the rule of law . <p> Finally comes the environment . Research shows clearly the importance of today 's environment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , transport systems , and green space . But the environment is also important in a quite different sense , since how we treat the planet today determines the world which future generations will inhabit . So when we are considering happiness and quality of life , we must take into account those future generations as well as our own . <p> The implications of all this evidence are far reaching . Here are six of the most important actions which are required if we want to create a happier society : <p> Mental Health . Evidence-based treatment should be as available for mental illness ( including depression and anxiety disorders ) as it is for physical illness . <p> Economic Policy . Employment is so important that no risks should be taken with economic stability , simply in order to increase economic growth . <p> Communities . Measures to promote economic growth should be accompanied by explicit policies to sustain social cohesion , stable family life , and personal security . <p> Equality . More equal incomes are desirable because extra money improves wellbeing more for the poor than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country increases mutual respect and trust , which are crucial for wellbeing . <p> Schools . Schools should aim explicitly at developing young people who are emotionally resilient and eager to contribute to the social good . <p> Families . Stable families are so important that every society needs its own system of support for couples in conflict . <p> Governments should make the happiness of the people the main outcome which they pursue . As Thomas Jefferson said \" The care of human life and happiness ... is the only legitimate object of good government \" . That is why there is now a growing demand to include subjective wellbeing in the new post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals . <p> But , perhaps most importantly of all , we need to encourage a more empathic and caring culture , where people care less about what they can get for themselves and more about the happiness of others . <p> This is why I 'm supporting the Day of Happiness , when Action for Happiness is encouraging people everywhere to make a personal pledge to live in a way that contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that our central purpose in life we would have a far happier and more cohesive world .

"text": "<h> Richard O'Brien : ' I 'm 70% man ' <p> Rocky Horror Show writer Richard O'Brien thinks of himself as 70% male and 30% female . What exactly does that mean ? <p> Richard O'Brien , writer of hit musical The Rocky Horror Show , delighted in shaking up the conservative sexual attitudes of the 1970s . <p> His most famous creation , Dr Frank N Furter , brought the house down with his song Sweet Transvestite . <p> But the show 's creator was ashamed about his own long-held desire to be more feminine . <p> \" I was six-and-a-half and I said to my big brother that I wanted to be the fairy princess when I grew up . The look of disdain on his face made me pull down the shutters . I knew that I should never ever say that out loud again . \" <p> For 50 years , O'Brien repressed the feeling . But \" you ca n't just put the lid on things and pretend that they do n't exist \" , he says . <p> I believe myself probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So a decade ago , he started taking the female hormone oestrogen - and is happy with the results . <p> \" It takes the edge off the masculine , testosterone-driven side of me and I like that very much . I think I 've become a nicer person in some ways , slightly softer . For the first time in my life , I 've started to put on a little bit of weight , which I like . \" <p> He has also developed small breasts . But O'Brien is not intending to go further and have sex reassignment surgery . <p> \" I do n't want to pretend to be something that I 'm not . Anton Rodgers , the actor , said ' you 're the third sex ' . And I thought that 's quite nice . I quite like that position . <p> \" It 's my belief that we are on a continuum between male and female . There are people who are hardwired male and there are people who are hardwired female , but most of us are on that continuum and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female . \" <p> O'Brien 's idea of a gender spectrum may sound far-fetched to many , but there is scientific research that backs up his position . Cambridge University psychology professor Melissa Hines says there are not two distinct sexes , male and female . <p> There are many dimensions of gender and an individual person can be in a different position in terms of how masculine or feminine they areProf Melissa Hines <p> \" I think that the research in this field suggests just the opposite . That there is not a gender binary , that there 's a range of gender , and there are many dimensions of gender and an individual person can be in a different position in terms of how masculine or feminine they are on each of these dimensions . \" <p> Professor Dinesh Bhugra , of the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London , offers a different view - suggesting that while people may feel not entirely male , or female , the reality is that they are born one or the other . <p> \" The distinction has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social construct , sex is biological . <p> \" My guess would be that social notions of gender dictate how we behave . \" <p> So , how can one explain the feeling experienced by some transgendered people of having been born into the wrong body and wanting to switch sex ? <p> It has been observed that the brains of male-to-female transsexuals resemble female brains in one region central to sexual behaviour . But it is not clear that this is a cause of transgenderism , rather than an effect . <h> Find out more <p> Listen to the full report on Analysis on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 18 March , 20:30 GMT and Sunday , at 21:30 GMT . <p> Hines thinks the male hormone , testosterone , may have a part to play . She has noticed that girls who have been exposed to unusually high levels in the womb tend to prefer stereotypical \" boys ' toys \" like trucks . And they are more likely than other girls to grow up wanting to live as men . <p> The UK 's main gender identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referrals last year . <p> There they are assessed by psychiatrists who will help them adjust to their preferred gender role . <p> After two years of living as the opposite sex in the UK , you can apply for a gender recognition certificate , which allows you to change your birth certificate . <p> To qualify , there is no obligation to have changed your body in any way through hormones or surgery . That means you can officially be a woman with a man 's body , or vice versa . <p> Stephen Whittle , professor of equalities law at Manchester Metropolitan University , realised as a 10-year-old that he did n't feel right as a girl . <p> \" It was school races day and there were girls ' races and boys ' races . It was my light on the road to Damascus - this sudden realisation that I was always going to be in the wrong race . \" <p> Image caption Stephen Whittle campaigns for transgender rights <p> At 17 , he started the process of changing sex . Surgery has left him with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers himself straightforwardly a man . <p> This is typical , says James Barrett , lead clinician at the Charing Cross National Gender Identity Clinic . Most of his patients identify as a man or a woman , rather than somewhere in between . <p> \" People who are seeking drastic surgical or hormonal treatment because they wish to live in a socially ambiguous gender role ... are thought about really carefully . The concern is that one does n't want to do anything that 's irreversible and then have them in a position where they 're not happy . \" <p> The problem is , says Dr Barrett , they have to fit in to a society that that thinks in terms of just two sexes . <p> \" It may well be that biological findings report that , in fact , everybody 's on a spectrum . It 's just that the way society works , most people do n't think of themselves as on any kind of a spectrum at all . <p> \" The same is probably true of sexual orientation . Most people do n't describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually , practically speaking , it very much is . \" <p> Some transgender people do not choose to change their bodies completely , however . <p> This can lead to complicated situations , such as people who choose to live as women - but who have male genitalia - being sent to jail for sexual offences . Should they be imprisoned alongside men or women ? <p> Image caption Official documents typically ask if the respondent is \" male \" or \" female \" <p> The law is clear that such a woman should go to a women 's prison , says lawyer and former MP , Lord Carlile . He was the first to raise the issue of transgenderism in Parliament in the 1990s . <p> \" If somebody goes into a court and is accused and their original name was ' John Smith ' and they choose to call themselves ' Jane Smith ' they will be tried as ' Jane Smith ' . I do n't see why what a court recognises should not also be recognised by the prison service . <p> \" Awkward though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as challenging and difficult . \" <p> According to Whittle , the UK is gradually removing the requirements for people to declare whether they 're a man or a woman . It has already happened with laws as diverse as the Sexual Offences Act and the Road Traffic Act . <p> He thinks the UK will follow Australia and Spain in doing away with the need to tick a box on your passport stating if you are male or female . <p> Which box does Richard O'Brien tick ? <p> \" I tick the M , \" he says . \" But I would quite like to have Other to tick . \" <p> Listen to the full report on Analysis on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 18 March , 20:30 GMT and Sunday , at 21:30 GMT .

<p> it has been observed that the brains of male-to-female transsexuals resemble female brains in one region central to sexual behaviour . but it is not clear that this is a cause of transgenderism , rather than an effect . <h> find out more <p> listen to the full report on analysis on bbc radio 4 on monday 18 march , 20:30 gmt and sunday , at 21:30 gmt . <p> hines thinks the male hormone , testosterone , may have a part to play . she has noticed that girls who have been exposed to unusually high levels in the womb tend to prefer stereotypical \" boys ' toys \" like trucks . and they are more likely than other girls to grow up wanting to live as men . <p> the uk 's main gender identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referrals last year . <p> there they are assessed by psychiatrists who will help them adjust to their preferred gender role . <p> after two years of living as the opposite sex in the uk , you can apply for a gender recognition certificate , which allows you to change your birth certificate . <p> to qualify , there is no obligation to have changed your body in any way through hormones or surgery . that means you can officially be a woman with a man 's body , or vice versa . <p> stephen whittle , professor of equalities law at manchester metropolitan university , realised as a 10-year-old that he did n't feel right as a girl . <p> \" it was school races day and there were girls ' races and boys ' races . it was my light on the road to damascus - this sudden realisation that i was always going to be in the wrong race . \" <p> image caption stephen whittle campaigns for transgender rights <p> at 17 , he started the process of changing sex . surgery has left him with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers himself straightforwardly a man . <p> this is typical , says james barrett , lead clinician at the charing cross national gender identity clinic . most of his patients identify as a man or a woman , rather than somewhere in between . <p> \" people who are seeking drastic surgical or hormonal treatment because they wish to live in a socially ambiguous gender role ... are thought about really carefully . the concern is that one does n't want to do anything that 's irreversible and then have them in a position where they 're not happy . \" <p> the problem is , says dr barrett , they have to fit in to a society that that thinks in terms of just two sexes . <p> \" it may well be that biological findings report that , in fact , everybody 's on a spectrum . it 's just that the way society works , most people do n't think of themselves as on any kind of a spectrum at all . <p> \" the same is probably true of sexual orientation . most people do n't describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually , practically speaking , it very much is . \" <p> some transgender people do not choose to change their bodies completely , however . <p> this can lead to complicated situations , such as people who choose to live as women - but who have male genitalia - being sent to jail for sexual offences . should they be imprisoned alongside men or women ? <p> image caption official documents typically ask if the respondent is \" male \" or \" female \" <p> the law is clear that such a woman should go to a women 's prison , says lawyer and former mp , lord carlile . he was the first to raise the issue of transgenderism in parliament in the 1990s . <p> \" if somebody goes into a court and is accused and their original name was ' john smith ' and they choose to call themselves ' jane smith ' they will be tried as ' jane smith ' . i do n't see why what a court recognises should not also be recognised by the prison service . <p> \" awkward though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as challenging and difficult . \" <p> according to whittle , the uk is gradually removing the requirements for people to declare whether they 're a man or a woman . it has already happened with laws as diverse as the sexual offences act and the road traffic act . <p> he thinks the uk will follow australia and spain in doing away with the need to tick a box on your passport stating if you are male or female . <p> which box does richard o'brien tick ? <p> \" i tick the m , \" he says . \" but i would quite like to have other to tick . \" <p> listen to the full report on analysis on bbc radio 4 on monday 18 march , 20:30 gmt and sunday , at 21:30 gmt .

"text": "<h> The surprising uses for birdsong <p> A 90-second daily show highlighting the songs of British birds has started on BBC Radio 4 this week . But birdsong is n't just beautiful to listen to , it is increasingly being used in surprising ways . <p> Can a nightingale 's song help you pass an exam or a blackbird 's twittering encourage you to open a bank account ? Sound experts are using it to do both . <p> They argue the positive results speak for themselves even though researchers say there is little hard scientific evidence to show people respond positively to birds singing . Most support for the theory is anecdotal . <p> So what are the innovative ways it is being used ? <h> Homework <p> Far too often noise can make it hard to concentrate , be it a loud television , loud traffic or loud people . But audio experts say certain sounds can make it easier to focus and they include birds singing . <h> Find out more <p> What makes birdsong so special is that it relaxes people physically but stimulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business and chairman of noise consultancy The Sound Agency . Birdsong creates a state he calls \" body relaxed , mind alert \" . <p> \" People find birdsong relaxing and reassuring because over thousands of years they have learnt when the birds sing they are safe , it 's when birds stop singing that people need to worry . Birdsong is also nature 's alarm clock , with the dawn chorus signalling the start of the day , so it stimulates us cognitively . \" <p> Treasure has used birdsong to develop a free smartphone app called Study . It claims to be a \" productivity-boosting \" soundscape to listen to while you work . It can help focus , improve cognition and reduce tiredness , Treasure argues . It 's also designed to mask background noise that can disturb concentration , particularly conversation . <p> The effect of birdsong on our brains is being researched by Eleanor Ratcliffe . She is carrying out a three-year study looking at how natural sounds can improve mood and attention for her PhD in Environmental Psychology at the University of Surrey . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wildlife Trust . <p> \" We need to find out if , how and why birdsong can be of psychological benefit . Many people believe it is , \" she says . <h> Post-meal slump <h> Birdsong in poetry <p> The nightingale has probably the most celebrated song , with John Keats describing the bird pouring forth thy soul abroad in such an ecstasy ! in his 1819 Ode to a Nightingale . <p> Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's 1798 poem The Nightingale reads : And hark ! the Nightingale begins its song . \" Most musical , most melancholy \" bird ! ... so his song should make all Nature lovelier , and itself be loved like Nature ! <p> William Wordsworth wrote the skylark 's babbling song dost pour upon the world a flood of harmony in his 1805 verse To a Skylark . <p> In the science world it 's known as postprandial somnolence but in the everyday world it 's commonly known as the post-meal slump . <p> It 's the period after a meal when blood sugar levels drop , causing you to get sleepy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely solutions , researchers are looking into what can lift people out of this soporific state after lunch . Birdsong has been found to work , they say . <p> An experiment at a primary school in Liverpool - run by \" sonic branding \" company Condiment Junkie , Glyndwr University and architects Nightingale Associates - found that playing pupils a soundscape of birdsong and other natural sounds made them more alert and better able to concentrate after their lunch break . <p> The key to the most effective audio was lack of repetition , say those involved . <p> Birdsong works because it 's stochastic , made up of lots of random sounds . There is no repeating rhythm or pattern to focus on . <p> \" It does n't get stuck in your head and annoy you but it does n't lull you to sleep and bore you either , \" says Russell Jones , from Condiment Junkie . <p> \" I 'm not sure there is any other sound that can do what birdsong does . It should be part of the soundtrack to everyone 's day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the corridors of Alder Hey Children 's Hospital in Liverpool among the noise of everyday hospital life you will hear birdsong . <p> Patients recorded the sound of birds in a local park as part of a project with the Foundation for Creative Technology ( FACT ) and award-winning wildlife sound recordist Chris Watson . <p> Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport uses birdsong in a quiet lounge where people can relax before their flight . Along with other calming methods birdsong is played through speakers hidden in real trees . Last month the airport was voted the third best in the world at the World Airport Awards and last year 95% of passengers rated it as good or excellent , according to Schiphol 's own figures . <p> Such projects try to use native birdsongs as they think they will be most successful . Ratcliffe is looking at responses to different birdsong and , depending on the outcome , it 's a possibility that in the future people could be prescribed certain bits of birdsong to suit their individual needs . <p> \" It would be nice to say to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> The National Trust suggests people listen to birdsong for a few minutes a day to combat low moods . Sound expert Julian Treasure agrees . <p> \" It resets the ears , allows us to hear properly . Most of us walk around with our ears switched off because so much noise is unpleasant . Unlike so many other sounds there 's no maximum exposure to birdsong . \" <h> Business <p> Treasure worked on one project in Colombia to rebrand a bank . As well as the visual side of things , a soundscape was also created that included birdsong . <p> The rebranding resulted in a \" dramatic uplift \" in people opening new accounts and customer approval ratings rose from 64% to 90% in just six months , says Treasure . <p> BP also used birdsong when research revealed toilets in its petrol stations were having a negative effect on customers ' feelings about the BP brand . A strategy was drawn up to improve the toilets including , among other things , a birdsong soundscape . The aim was to create a mental connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services in Cambridgeshire and across Europe . Customer satisfaction ratings rose by 50% , says Treasure . <p> \" Architects need to start designing for our ears as well as our eyes , \" says Treasure . \" Businesses also need to recognise its importance .

"title": "Can DirectAccess take over the world?\n",
"text": "<p> Review Microsoft believes that DirectAccess is such a critical feature of Windows that we will soon wonder how we lived without this fundamental part of network infrastructure . <p> Having played with it I think Microsoft is very close to being right , but there are some bugs to work out and misconceptions to dispel . <p> Internet Protocol version 6 ( IPv6 ) promises rainbows and kittens because every device with an IPv6 address can communicate directly with any other . That is a happy world for application developers . <p> Many who preach the gospel of end-to-end connectivity have assured me that the world will collapse unless we drastically lower the knowledge required to develop an internet-connected application . <h> Direct answer <p> But network and systems administrators are somewhat less keen on having their network attack surface transformed from a single externally addressable system into every system plugged into the network . <p> For reasons of \" you do not pay me enough for this \" , administrators prefer defending one device instead of thousands . <p> Sadly , application developers won the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of securing the future rests on network administrators . And that is why DirectAccess was created . <p> In its original incarnation DirectAccess mediated communication between a client 's public IPv6 and a company 's IPv6-enabled server fleet . DirectAccess verified that the computer attempting access was domain-joined , patched , authorised for access and so forth . It provided a single point of defence , even in an IPv6 world . <p> In a future where the right of anyone with a computer to directly address every device on your network ( from your internet-connected light bulb to a hospital 's medical equipment ) is enshrined in nerd law , DirectAccess gives Microsoft-using administrators a fighting chance . <p> If you can master DirectAccess , then you can take advantage of the benefits end-to-end connectivity can offer while mitigating the risks . <p> Most of the confusion surrounding DirectAccess stems from the fact that it is no more a single technology than Microsoft Exchange is . What we think of as Exchange is a large collection of highly interdependent applications . These in turn are dependent upon applications that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information Services ( IIS ) and certificate management . <h> Firewall extension <p> DirectAccess is no different . The second misconception we need to deal with is that , despite layers of confusing marketing , DirectAccess access is not a virtual private network ( VPN ) . VPN-like technologies are almost always involved in a DirectAccess configuration , but they are to DirectAccess as IIS is to Exchange ( or DNS to Active Directory ) . <p> DirectAccess is a first attempt at making an IPv6 firewall that mere mortals can ( supposedly ) comprehend . In essence , the core executable is a connection broker . You connect to it , it verifies you are who you say you are and then lets you access company resources . <p> Indeed , DirectAccess will not work if you disable Windows Firewall . If you think of DirectAccess as an extension of Windows Firewall ( rather than a VPN technology ) the rest of this overview will make a lot more sense . <p> In the real world , almost no one has IPv6 for all internal servers , for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you might want to have a client connect to your network . It will be decades before this becomes a reality . <p> This means that any practical DirectAccess deployment relies upon some other technologies . At a minimum it uses Isatap to ensure IPv6 connectivity between all intranet sites and connected clients . <p> DirectAccess also uses the NAT64 and DNS64 protocol translators to ensure that clients can access IPv4 systems on your network .

"lower_text": "<p> review microsoft believes that directaccess is such a critical feature of windows that we will soon wonder how we lived without this fundamental part of network infrastructure . <p> having played with it i think microsoft is very close to being right , but there are some bugs to work out and misconceptions to dispel . <p> internet protocol version 6 ( ipv6 ) promises rainbows and kittens because every device with an ipv6 address can communicate directly with any other . that is a happy world for application developers . <p> many who preach the gospel of end-to-end connectivity have assured me that the world will collapse unless we drastically lower the knowledge required to develop an internet-connected application . <h> direct answer <p> but network and systems administrators are somewhat less keen on having their network attack surface transformed from a single externally addressable system into every system plugged into the network . <p> for reasons of \" you do not pay me enough for this \" , administrators prefer defending one device instead of thousands . <p> sadly , application developers won the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of securing the future rests on network administrators . and that is why directaccess was created . <p> in its original incarnation directaccess mediated communication between a client 's public ipv6 and a company 's ipv6-enabled server fleet . directaccess verified that the computer attempting access was domain-joined , patched , authorised for access and so forth . it provided a single point of defence , even in an ipv6 world . <p> in a future where the right of anyone with a computer to directly address every device on your network ( from your internet-connected light bulb to a hospital 's medical equipment ) is enshrined in nerd law , directaccess gives microsoft-using administrators a fighting chance . <p> if you can master directaccess , then you can take advantage of the benefits end-to-end connectivity can offer while mitigating the risks . <p> most of the confusion surrounding directaccess stems from the fact that it is no more a single technology than microsoft exchange is . what we think of as exchange is a large collection of highly interdependent applications . these in turn are dependent upon applications that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information services ( iis ) and certificate management . <h> firewall extension <p> directaccess is no different . the second misconception we need to deal with is that , despite layers of confusing marketing , directaccess access is not a virtual private network ( vpn ) . vpn-like technologies are almost always involved in a directaccess configuration , but they are to directaccess as iis is to exchange ( or dns to active directory ) . <p> directaccess is a first attempt at making an ipv6 firewall that mere mortals can ( supposedly ) comprehend . in essence , the core executable is a connection broker . you connect to it , it verifies you are who you say you are and then lets you access company resources . <p> indeed , directaccess will not work if you disable windows firewall . if you think of directaccess as an extension of windows firewall ( rather than a vpn technology ) the rest of this overview will make a lot more sense . <p> in the real world , almost no one has ipv6 for all internal servers , for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you might want to have a client connect to your network . it will be decades before this becomes a reality . <p> this means that any practical directaccess deployment relies upon some other technologies . at a minimum it uses isatap to ensure ipv6 connectivity between all intranet sites and connected clients . <p> directaccess also uses the nat64 and dns64 protocol translators to ensure that clients can access ipv4 systems on your network . the server 2008 r2 version did not include these elements as part of the core offering ; server 2012 does . <p> in addition to being made up of several sub technologies , directaccess has been merged into the larger remote access role within server 2012 . it is no longer seen as a novel technology and has become merely one more sub-component of remoteaccess.

Most of my work is sitting down so this is an energising start to the day . <p> Once I have had breakfast , which is my favourite meal , I set off on the 35-minute drive to work . I am based at Southlands Assessment Unit , a mental health unit for older adults within the Kent and Medway partnership trust . Dementia UK is the charity behind the Admiral Nurse model , supporting us in our practice development and ensuring we all work consistently to the charity 's standards . <p> My day starts with a 9am appointment . Mr Jones is a younger carer who is supporting his wife ; she was diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease when she was 53 . It is an emotional appointment , working through feelings of loss and adjustment -- Mr Jones has experienced lots changes to their relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my electronic records and make a couple of phone calls . I get a call from the reception to let me know my next client Miss White has arrived . It is a new referral so this will take up to two hours to assess and understand her needs . Miss White is struggling to care for her mother who lives with her and has a diagnosis of Lewy Body dementia . <p> I think I have the best job in the world , but it can be emotionally exhausting . I receive both managerial and clinical supervision from my manager . I also receive specific Admiral Nurse group clinical supervision with an independent facilitator provided by the Dementia UK as part of our practice development day . Clinical supervision provides an opportunity to talk through themes and reflect on some of the more complex cases . <p> I have worked within the mental health trust for 26 years ; the last four of those years have been within my current role . During my career , I have been supported to study psychotherapy , mindfulness CBT , counselling and behavioural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse registration has been hugely beneficial in my work . <p> Admiral Nurses are specialist mental health nurses who work clinically with families affected by dementia and particularly those with complex needs . We also provide consultancy in the form of teaching , education and raising the profile of dementia . I enjoy the mix of clinical and consultancy work , and although I am ambitious to progress within my career it is difficult to find a job that equals what I am doing now . I feel hugely privileged to have the opportunity to work with and be able to make a difference to the lives of the people I meet . <p> At 1.15pm , I leave the office to drive to the local university in Medway . I am going to talk to a first-year cohort of nursing students prior to their older adult placement . I present the Admiral Nurse role and talk about dementia . It is a lively group of students with lots of questions and some apprehensions . It is important that we are involved in this work to talk through common myths held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I finish at the university at 4pm ; my last appointment is with a lady whose husband has recently moved into residential care . She was his sole carer until his move and has struggled in making the decision . Mrs Smith developed some compulsive behaviour , and she has n't visited her husband since he left the marital home . She is tearful but she agrees to accompany me on a visit to see her husband . <p> This evening I am meeting friends for supper , so once home I walk Monty . We have a few games of chase the stick before getting ready to go out . When I get home at around 10pm , I have a cup of tea and cuddle with Monty before going to bed ... as I drift off to sleep , I think how lucky I am . <p> If you would like to feature in our series , or know someone who would , let us know by emailing us at **26;746;TOOLONG ",

"text": "<h> The humanitarian headache of bringing home Syria 's bodies <p> Female members of the ' Mother Aisha ' battalion -- an all female unit of the Syrian rebels -- sit together in Aleppo 's Salaheddine district Reuters <p> Khaled Erksoussi is planning to leave Syria . <p> The Damascus Secretary General of the Syrian Red Crescent -- 22 of whose volunteers have already been killed in the war -- was fired from his full time job with a Damascus telecoms company this week , probably because he spends too much time on humanitarian work . <p> The Red Crescent ca n't match his old salary . Besides , donor money is drying up , talented volunteers are already being poached abroad . And who wants to spend their time stuffing three-day old corpses into body-bags and negotiating with up to 12 different groups across the front lines ? <p> For this is also a gruesome story . Reader beware . <p> \" It looks like there is no money any more from the donor side , \" he says . \" All our partners are suffering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you notice that when the chemical issue ( sic ) happened , in the UN Security Council , the first decision was to go in and investigate -- but what about the medical side ? It shows what is important : finding the guilty -- the victim does n't matter . \" <p> Mr Erksoussi is a difficult man to disabuse -- the UN inspectors were not sent to point the finger at the guilty , but he has a good enough argument . Pointing the finger gets more credit than understanding the tragedy through which Mr Erksoussi 's colleagues work . <p> Take the body retrievals , most of them of soldiers killed by rebels -- dozens of them -- often brought home three at a time . \" Sometimes they the insurgents play tricks . Not long ago , we went to collect the bodies of three soldiers . But the last body we were carrying , our people thought something was wrong . One of the bodies seemed to have wires attached to it . We left it in place . Now we have demanded that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both sides must take from the corpses what is on them , whatever it is , even ammunition . I do n't want to deal with a hand grenade in an ambulance ... \" <p> Most recently , the Red Crescent has been ferrying cooked food into the hell-hole of Aleppo prison , a vast block held by government forces and guards but totally surrounded by rebels , in which hundreds of prisoners -- common criminals , detainees and insurgent enemies of the government -- are now held amid dirt and lack of sanitation and shellfire . <p> \" We managed to get dozens of prisoners out who had officially finished their sentences and they just needed a safe passage out . But the first time we went there , one of the rebel groups fired a rocket-propelled grenade at one of our cars . They missed . Everything was in place and cleared with all the groups , but this one said : ' We are upset because you did n't talk to us . ' We said , ' well , we 'll shout next time -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one volunteer and killed a government judge ( who was ) with us . <p> \" Last time , we had a team in Deir el-Zour and they were detained by the al-Nusra forces for seven hours . We were with an International Red Cross team and Jabhat al-Nusra hate what they call ' this damned Red Cross ' . We said , well , you 've been eating food with ICRC red crosses on without caring very much . \" <p> Now the Red Crescent can supply even insurgent-held Raqaa with supplies , but not the centre of Aleppo city which has been besieged for a month . <p> Days of negotiations between government and rebel forces precede most body extractions . \" They usually come out within two to three days . The rebels usually know the names of the soldiers they 've killed . The deal is done between them on the front lines . They use us as mediators to cross the front lines and get corpses out . When they make the deal , we get in touch with both sides to make sure it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually we put them in body bags . The bodies are sometimes left in the place where they were killed -- most of them shot -- but last time in Deraya ( a suburb of Damascus ) , they ( the rebels ) just pulled them from the place where they died to a house nearby where they gave them to us . \" <p> The last two Red Crescent volunteers to be killed were in Homs two months ago when a mortar shell fell outside the local Red Crescent office . The war came to them . <p> Khaled Erksoussi speaks with great care about some elements of the Red Crescent 's work . I can well see why . More than 15 volunteers remain imprisoned by the regime . The problem of what is lawful and unlawful in war has been a major problem . \" The government still regards the finding of a make-shift hospital as a victory \" -- since it has usually been set up to help wounded insurgents who can not go to a government hospital -- \" but this contradicts the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr Erksoussi believes that the fighting around Damascus has become more ferocious but \" you ca n't win with force -- this idea is on both sides now .

' we said , ' well , we 'll shout next time -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one volunteer and killed a government judge ( who was ) with us . <p> \" last time , we had a team in deir el-zour and they were detained by the al-nusra forces for seven hours . we were with an international red cross team and jabhat al-nusra hate what they call ' this damned red cross ' . we said , well , you 've been eating food with icrc red crosses on without caring very much . \" <p> now the red crescent can supply even insurgent-held raqaa with supplies , but not the centre of aleppo city which has been besieged for a month . <p> days of negotiations between government and rebel forces precede most body extractions . \" they usually come out within two to three days . the rebels usually know the names of the soldiers they 've killed . the deal is done between them on the front lines . they use us as mediators to cross the front lines and get corpses out . when they make the deal , we get in touch with both sides to make sure it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . usually we put them in body bags . the bodies are sometimes left in the place where they were killed -- most of them shot -- but last time in deraya ( a suburb of damascus ) , they ( the rebels ) just pulled them from the place where they died to a house nearby where they gave them to us . \" <p> the last two red crescent volunteers to be killed were in homs two months ago when a mortar shell fell outside the local red crescent office . the war came to them . <p> khaled erksoussi speaks with great care about some elements of the red crescent 's work . i can well see why . more than 15 volunteers remain imprisoned by the regime . the problem of what is lawful and unlawful in war has been a major problem . \" the government still regards the finding of a make-shift hospital as a victory \" -- since it has usually been set up to help wounded insurgents who can not go to a government hospital -- \" but this contradicts the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> mr erksoussi believes that the fighting around damascus has become more ferocious but \" you ca n't win with force -- this idea is on both sides now . what 's preventing both of them from stopping is ' ego ' . it 's not like they 're equal . when a government thinks it is fighting terrorists or ' evil ' , you still have to be responsible for civilians . but unless you close the tap -- weapons and money -- it will continue forever . i ca n't say this place is going to hell -- because it 's already there . \" <p> weapons data is handed over to watchdog <p> syria has sent the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons an \" initial declaration \" outlining its weapons program , the organisation said friday . <p> spokesman michael luhan told the associated press that the declaration is \" being reviewed by our verification division . \" the organisation will not release details of what is in the declaration . <p> the opcw , which polices the treaty outlawing chemical weapons , is looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arsenal of poison gas and nerve agents as well as its production facilities . <p> however , diplomatic efforts to speed up the process are moving slowly . <p> a meeting initially scheduled for sunday at which the opcw 's 41-nation executive council was due to discuss a us-russian plan to swiftly rid syria of chemical weapons was postponed yesterday . no new date was immediately set and no reason was given for the postponement . ap "

"text": "<h> Michael Owen 's dream of Melbourne Cup glory is very much alive <h> Michael Owen 's dream of having a runner in the Emirates Melbourne Cup in on Nov 5 is very much alive despite his gritty stayer Brown Panther finishing only fifth in Wednesday 's Greene King Foundation Stakes over an inadequate mile-and-a-quarter trip at Goodwood . <p> And so serious is the ex-football star at getting involved in Australia 's showcase race , he is sending Brown Panther 's jockey Richard Kingscote to the important Turnbull Stakes meeting at Flemington , on Oct 5 , in an attempt to get first-hand experience of the track . <p> Trainer Tom Dascombe said : \" I 'm happy enough with that run . You ca n't really complain when you run in a race you never planned for in the first place . He 'd had a setback before the Irish St Leger and we had to run here to make sure he was all right . \" <p> Brown Panther is around 20-1 for the Melbourne Cup , but as far as Dascombe is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" His setback was nothing serious , but it was enough to knock us off stride . <p> \" He ran a temperature and was off his grub for 24 hours . He missed a couple of days and you ca n't go for a big race in those circumstances . But , he 's done well enough with this final run before going into quarantine . <p> \" Richard has probably gone a bit too quick out in front , and we were trying to give 5lb to the winner , so all things considered , I was happy . He 'll go into quarantine here for two weeks and then fly down to Melbourne , all going well . \" <p> As for Kingscote going on an early reconnaissance mission to Australia , Dascombe said : \" It would be very useful if Richard could get rides at Flemington in early October . It is hard enough turning up to ride in the biggest race of your career without any previous experience of the track . <p> \" One of our owners has contacts in Melbourne , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Richard knows the horse , he now has to learn what he can about the course , \" he added . <p> Brown Panther first emerged as a likely prospect for Melbourne when winning the Goodwood Cup in August in which the homebred gave Owen his biggest success as an owner . He bred the five-year-old out of his mare Treble Heights , a Group winner trained for him by John Gosden . <p> The winner Grandeur is a smart performer in his own right and was getting his season back on track with this convincing success under Ryan Moore . <p> He put a disappointing effort in the Arlington Million last time behind him with this victory and trainer Jeremy Noseda has some ambitious targets for the autumn , including the Breeders ' Cup at Santa Anita in early November . <p> \" I was very worried about the ground today but I wanted to get another run into him before he goes off to America again , \" said Noseda . <p> \" He has a few options out there and I will have to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anita , but there are horses like The Fugue going there so we 'll have to see .

"text": "<h> Foster &amp; Allen on their new autobiography and five decades of success <p> WHEN Tony Allen left technical school in his home town of Moate , County Westmeath in 1967 , he could not possibly have envisaged the incredible music career that was to follow . <p> His story of success is the subject of a new autobiography with his cohort Mick Foster , entitled After All These Years : Our Story . Tony first met Mick Foster when they both played in the same local band , The Nightrunners , and were both in and out of the Irish Midlands ' trad scene . <p> So how did they eventually get from playing in local bands to performing on TV and the world 's concert stages -- selling millions of records along the way ? And how did he and Mick end up working as a duo in 1975 ? <p> Tony takes up the story : \" We had done some gigs in London with the band and Paddy Callaghan had taken over The Prince of Wales pub in Kilburn , \" he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there so the rest of the band went home and we stayed on \" . <p> \" That was really the start of the duo . Mick had been on to me to leave the band The Nightrunners . He had seen the Alexander Brothers from Scotland when they came over to Ireland and he thought there should be an Irish version . <p> \" He eventually persuaded me to leave the band and go on the road -- just the two of us . I was playing organ and keyboards at the time and Mick was on the accordion so we went down the road as Foster &amp; Allen doing the local pubs and traveling all over the country playing pubs and GAA halls . <p> \" At that stage the ballad scene had developed into a sort of cabaret scene . A lot of the bands had broken up and formed smaller groups and the cabaret scene was going great . In 1978 we signed a record deal with Donie Cassidy . We had just released The Blacksmith and then Bunch of Thyme which went to number one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London with Mick Clerkin and it went into the British record charts . We got on Top of the Pops and that really started the whole thing going outside Ireland . It then went from strength to strength and we are still kicking around at it \" . <p> In such a long career there must have been many highlights ? \" I think for us it would have to be our appearance on Top of the Pops in 1982 , \" says Tony . <p> \" That changed the whole thing for us . If you think about it , we went from playing the likes of The Prince of Wales in Kilburn or the Irish Club in Birmingham , to doing a concert tour of England -- the big theatres . Our records were being played on all the regional stations . That was a big change \" . <p> \" Then in 1983 Maggie came out and Mick McDonagh , the man who put the Green Velvet albums together , sent the song to Ken Harding in Australia . Ken released it as a single and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five weeks so that established us over there \" . <p> Tony was anxious to acknowledge the importance of the Green Velvet compilation albums that did so well in the British charts . <p> \" Because they were backed by a TV advertising campaign they brought Irish folk music into the mainstream . Apart from Foster &amp; Allen tracks they featured De Dannan with Mary Black , The Fureys , Irish Mist and Brendan Grace , who was huge at the time . <p> \" It meant people who might not have been too familiar with Irish folk music were now being exposed to it at peak viewing times and they latched on to it . \" <p> The importance of national TV advertising can not be overstated in the success of Foster &amp; Allen . <p> In relation to the way that daytime television has changed Tony said : \" In the old days you could do something like Pebble Mill at One and the whole country would see it . You could be on all day now and hardly anyone would see it because there are so many stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" We have the book out now which tells our own individual stories and the story of the band .

"text": "<h> ' Failure in basic care ' of Savita Halappanavar <p> Image caption Savita Halappanavar , 31 , died after a miscarriage in University Hospital Galway last October <p> A report into the death of Savita Halappanavar and related issues has found a failure to provide the most basic elements of care in her case . <p> The pregnant 31-year-old died in an Irish hospital in October last year . <p> She had asked for a termination after being told she was having a miscarriage , but staff refused .

"text": "<h> Tommy Robinson has left the EDL . But this is a change of key , not a change of message <p> Tommy Robinson feels he can no longer keep extremists in the party at bay Getty Images <p> The announcement yesterday morning that Tommy Robinson and Kev Carroll , co-founders of the English Defence League , were to leave the group took many by surprise . By removing himself from the far-right movement , Tommy Robinson is changing his tactics , but -- as I learned at the press conference last night -- there 's little to suggest he will be denouncing Islamophobic views anytime soon . <p> Only this year , Tommy was filmed at an EDL organised street demonstration shouting how ' Islam is not a religion of peace , it is fascist and violent ' , and last night Tommy refused to take back comments made in the past concerning his views on Islam . <p> He seemed wholly uncomfortable when faced with questions regarding his views on Halal cuisine , and would not retract past comments that mosque-building in the UK should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tommy still asserted he stands by past comments made about \" links between Islam and paedophilia . \" However , last night the Quilliam foundation , who broke the news of Robinson 's retreat from the EDL , were keen to reiterate that \" Tommy and Kev do not hate Muslims . \" The two journalists next to me both commented at this point \" something here is n't right \" . <p> When asked if this was the easy way out for him , Tommy said that he \" only got 45 minutes sleep last night \" . He 'd \" neglected his wife and family \" , he said , and told us he was \" dreading going home \" . At one point I came close to feeling sorry for the bloke who has had such a ' difficult ' time of it , but then I remembered he 's Tommy Robinson from the EDL . It needs to be made clear , these men last night made no attempt to denounce actions of the EDL in the past , nor the principles the EDL stands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nawaz , co-founder and chairman of Quilliam , an anit-extremism group , had only started speaking to the ex-EDL frontmen over the \" last couple of days . \" It certainly was made no clearer at the press conference last night as to what the EDL leadership had done to prove they were n't actually racist - but Nawaz pointed out that he and his colleague were Muslim , and therefore how could Tommy be racist ? <p> In essence , I was left wondering what on earth was going on . For Tommy and Kev it 's clear they have a lot to gain from moving away from the EDL , a failing organisation described by the men as \" out of control \" . This way they can be seen as more moderate , a voice of reason from the right . <p> Moreover , with groups such as UKIP finding such electoral success in the UK , is it any wonder that Tommy and his cronies are looking for ' a more democratic ' way of pursuing their racist agenda ? <p> However , for Quilliam , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nawaz was clear last night that the ex-EDL leaders were to receive \" training and education \" through his foundation to \" educate them on Islam \" . However , there was no plan presented of how this would take place , or what Quilliam envisaged doing with their latest recruits . Speaking to an international relations scholar last night at the University of Oxford , who has spent time working with Muslim community groups in the north , I was told that \" nobody in the Muslim community takes Quilliam seriously . \" <p> Last night Tommy asserted ' there are problems and we need to solve them . We must confront the problem but marching and chanting is offending moderates ' . Clearly , he and Carroll are trying a change of tactic , but their dangerous views have not suddenly been enlightened . \" We are singing from the same song-sheet , just the same sheet as Quilliam against Islamism \" Carroll told the audience . Forget Quilliam , the song-sheet Carroll and Robinson hold is full of bile , and a change of key wo n't change @ @ @ ",

Reflecting a belief that the Tories are scoring better with the public on the welfare issue , Morris is quoted as saying : \" The challenge is very severe ... if you look at politically salient target groups those numbers get worse . \" <p> Morris told a meeting at the Trades Union Congress last Friday that a poll of 3,000 voters had found that 53% of those questioned supported changes to the benefits system .

"text": "<h> The Cost of a Glass of Milk <p> The sight of a dairy herd grazing upon a grassy field is a ubiquitous one in Britain and Europe , appearing on the labels of dairy products that we consume , as well as in the countryside itself . Yet it represents only a part of the European dairy industry . <p> What of the cows that we do not see ? Those with little or no access to those fields , those who are tethered and those who are pushed to their limits by excessive milk production ? This may not be a familiar image to many of us , but it is the stark reality for a shockingly high proportion of dairy cows across Europe . <p> Last summer my charity , Compassion in World Farming , carried out a series of undercover investigations at over 50 farms in Germany , Denmark and Spain , to find out what conditions were like for dairy cows in the EU . We were appalled by what we found . <p> Many cows were living in zero-graze conditions , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lie down , and move a few steps in any direction . In Germany , 11 of the 14 farms we visited kept their cows tethered with chains in ' tie-stalls ' , some of them for the whole year . Living spaces were often barren and without straw , leading to painful sores and swollen joints from the hard floor , and some cows were found sitting in their own faeces . These cows were frequently forced to their limits to produce high yields of milk , becoming bony with exhaustion , and slaughtered , often at a young age , when their yield began to diminish . It makes for harrowing reading , I know . It 's even harder to see . <p> This research comes from just three countries , but is , we suspect , a good representation of dairy farming across Europe . It is estimated that over one third of dairy cows in the EU are ' zero-grazed ' and that a further one fifth are tethered in tie-stalls for at least part of the year . Even in the UK , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life indoors . <p> It seems ludicrous that such injustices should be legal , but the problem is , dairy cows are not specifically protected by EU law . Unlike other farm animals , such as poultry and pigs , there is no EU legislation which refers to dairy cow welfare specifically . <p> Last October , Compassion joined with the World Society for the Protection of Animals ( WSPA ) and ice cream maker Ben and Jerry 's in forming the Supporting Better Dairy coalition . The aim of our campaign is to urge the European Commission to bring in a species-specific Directive in order to ensure a set of minimum welfare standards for dairy cows across Europe . Today ( 23 October ) we will present the signatures of more than 250,000 EU citizens who agree to a representative of the European Commission . <p> We believe that every cow should have access to pasture during the grass-growing season , and be liberated from cruel practices such as tethering that we encountered in our investigations . Cows should be fed in a way that meets their dietary needs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be measures put in place to prevent their pain and suffering . <p> Cows are intelligent , sentient beings that deserve our respect and better protection . It is my hope that this meeting will be a significant step towards the much needed action for ensuring dairy cow welfare . ",

"text": "<h> Ghost Recon : Future Soldier preview -- the science of war <p> The future of warfare is closer than you think , as GameCentral goes hands-on with the new Ghost Recon and its high tech military gadgetry . <p> Ghost Recon : Future Soldier -- war never changes ? <p> Have you ever noticed how modern sci-fi games and movies never seem to feature ray guns or other more advanced technologies anymore ? Rapid space flight is still commonplace but in an attempt to create a kind of grounded realism even games like Halo and Mass Effect are filled with machineguns and other almost contemporary technology . <p> The peculiar upshot of this is that the Ghost Recon series , which has always tried to accurately simulate the near future of infantry combat , now seems more sci-fi than actual sci-fi games . But everything in the new Future Soldier game is based on technologies that are either just about to be deployed or are at least under development . <p> We got to play short sections of five different levels , all featuring your four-man squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Russian soldiers ( we 've no idea yet what the story is behind the game , except that it references Shadow Wars on the 3DS -- which presumably means robot drones at some point ) . Squad controls have fallen out of fashion in recent years , so even though Future Soldier doesn ? ? ? t necessarily do anything new with them it 's good simply to see them back . <p> The third person controls are standard for the genre and although you can direct team-mates to move to specific spots , or take out specific enemies , they 'll conduct themselves perfectly well on their own . They will always follow your lead though and wo n't start a firefight without you . This leads to many moments where you set up a ' synchshot ' attack , where each team member is locked onto an enemy , their blue laser sighting only waiting for your order to send a bullet whizzing along its trajectory . <p> One of the main new technological gimmicks for Future Soldier is optical camo . These are n't quite invisibility cloaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen even when right next to an enemy -- as long as you are n't moving . The faster you go the less useful they are , but those who always favour a stealth approach will love them . <p> The obvious concern with this sort of high tech equipment , especially when most of your enemies are just AK-47 wielding terrorists , is that it makes the game too easy . That 's certainly not the case from what we 've seen though , not least because you 're almost always outnumbered . But there 's also an interesting suppression mechanic where the camera wobbles wildly when you 're under heavy weapons fire , to mimic the confusion and panic you 'd feel if it was really happening . <p> It 's not a concept we 've seen since the Brothers In Arms games and struggling to call in your team to take out your attacker really does induce a genuine sense of panic . Although if you do get hit there 's a relatively generous bleed out time limit that allows your team to came and find and revive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got what amounts to x-ray vision through your heads-up display ' cross-com ' eye piece . You 've a little flying drone that you can deploy whenever you want to scout the area , which will even target enemies for the rest of the team . Or if enemies are closer by you can throw a ' sensor grenade ' which will instantly add anyone with a gun to your list of targets . <p> It 's all made to look very plausible and as you can see from our interview with one of the team most of the tech is either already in action or relatively imminent . We even happened across this story on the BBC today , which illustrates the current real world progress with optical camo . <p> As interesting and novel as all this is though it does n't automatically make for a great game , although there are some other interesting ideas beyond the gadgets . Civilians are much more prominent and numerous than in other similar games and they can easily tip off enemies as to your presence . <p> Creeping through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been simply because we did n't know when a civilian might call out to the guards if they saw us , or when they might stampede in panic when the fighting started . <p> One level set on a busy street in Pakistan almost seemed like a riff on Heat , with abandoned cars everywhere as you methodically work your way up towards your target . This was the most exciting and distinctive level , although a more stealth-based one in a Russian forest was also interesting . Especially in terms of the amount of freedom it gave you in the route you took through it and how stealthy you were about it . <p> We enjoyed the demo but there were definitely concerns . The four soldiers making up your team had no discernable personality , or even distinguishing features , and we 're not convinced from our interview that this will necessarily change in the final game . This might not be a serious flaw , but it does seem a missed opportunity give the focus on how they all work together . <p> A more obvious issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which genuinely did look PlayStation 2 quality in places . This we were assured would change in the final game , and given that the rest of the visuals look fine we 're willing to believe that for now . <p> We certainly hope the game turns out well because we need more realistic science fiction games , and although that was probably never the role Ghost Recon was trying to fill it does so very well anyway.Formats : Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , PC and Nintendo DSPublisher : UbisoftDeveloper : Ubisoft Paris and Ubisoft Red StormRelease Date : 25th May 2012 ( PC TBA ) ",

"text": "<h> When the Big Boss takes over : The rise of female bullies Dolly Bindra and Pooja Misrra <p> Her loud and intimidating presence is her main claim to fame . It was Dolly Bindra 's bossiness and instant name-calling that made her the most popular contestant of Bigg Boss Season 4 . <p> Bindra did n't hesitate to shout or abuse others and even resorted to emotional blackmail when it suited her . <p> Pooja Misrra was quick to follow Bindra 's suit in the recently concluded season , and became the new female bully , the woman who intimidates people to get her way with them . <p> Dolly Bindra did n't hesitate to shout or abuse others and even resorted to emotional blackmail when it suited her on the show <p> Her eyes flash , her voice is loud and haranguing , she stands arms akimbo , in your face , full body thrust , challenging . Her game is intimidation to get what she wants , to be heard and to block out others . <p> The universal pattern of female bullies is visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aggressively grabbing what it wants . <p> The whole gamut : the ' kali ' -eyed women of the saas bahu serials who stride around to thundering music ; the subtly overpowering Desperate Housewives ; Tanu who weds Manu ; the raging rough queens of politics ; the haranguing feminist groups ' fighting ' for women 's rights . <p> Women who clamour for attention through their own victimhood are equally bullying . For example , the miserable , sacrificing , widowed , sewing-machine wielding , TB stricken mother of old Hindi movies who controlled outcomes of when her sons and daughters would eat and who they could go out with . <p> DEEPLY INGRAINED IN OUR PSYCHE <p> Numerous examples come to mind when I think ' female bullies ' and the diverse ways in which women misuse this force . It makes me wonder if women have swung from inhabiting one stereotype to another . Has the doormat woman , in her search for the self , transformed into the vicious bully ? <p> Or is it that she always existed , as an exaggerated expression of self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what it takes to achieve what she wants ? <p> Pooja Misrra was quick to follow Bindra 's suit in the recently concluded season , and became the new female bully , the woman who intimidates people to get her way with them <p> Deeply implanted in the psyche of Indian society are the timeless energies of Mahabharata and Ramayana which also include Kaikayi as a key player in the form of the Machiavellian wife who used all she had , including boons of gratitude to twist things in her favour . Is there a female bully in your home ? <p> Is there one in you ? When I asked people this question , they had no stories to tell about themselves or bosses , wives , sisters , making me wonder if this was a secret that no one wanted to talk about ? <p> Is it because the men do n't want to admit that the women boss them around ? As for the women , is it that they do n't want to accept that the one they call a ' Bitch ' laughingly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to ? <p> A LEGACY OF BULLYING <p> As an older sister of three brothers I grew up bossing them . When I could not win with words , I beat them physically until they outgrew me physically . <p> Yes , I am an erstwhile bully . As a little girl I had figured out what made my whole world tick . Being witty got me what I needed from dad , even if it meant going against my mother 's wishes . Jealous of my younger , angelic-looking brother , I made it my life 's agenda to make him pay for being born . <p> The easiest way to do that was to become the focus of everyone 's attention and throw into the mix hitting , pinching , tale telling . As I got older , I learned to use ignoring and viciousness as my tools . <p> I was a bullying girl without realising it . I schemed , calculated and manipulated to get what I wanted , no matter what . Today I look back on my life journey -- a marriage , motherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most of my relationships have been skewed . Two thirds of my life has been about aggression -- either dishing it out or receiving it . <p> I would either bully or be bullied . I was helpless in the clutches of this need within me for extreme expressions of anger . <p> WORKING IT OUT <p> Psychologists say that at the core of every bully is a fearful child . Bullying can only stop when we are ready to acknowledge our power , ignore the ' fearful child ' and confront the bully in ourselves , and her dynamicshow she creeps up on her when we insist on our way -- directly or insidiously ? <p> Also , what do we as women or as victims of female bullying toward us and toward men , want to do about it ? What are our options when we come face to face with the bullying woman ? <p> Do we quietly go along with whatever she wants or ignore her and do what is ok by us ? The answers are different for each of us . <p> Every individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 50 , I am pleased to say that I have worked that bully out of my system . <p> I have grown up . I no longer have any need to abuse my power or give it away to anyone else . These healing years have , however , been tinged with remorse at my past behaviour . When my brother jokes with me and says ' We are scared for life , ' I am reminded that as his bullying older sister , I must have something to do with his childhood perceptions of how harsh the world is . <p> Would this perception not have impacted his life and his relationships ? Has he been in other relationships where the dynamics have been the same -- where he has felt helpless in the face of overt or subtle domineering ? Only he knows the answer . <h> Your little princess may be a bully after all <p> She may not shout , throw tantrums or come home with torn clothes like her brother . But this does n't mean that your little princess ca n't knock someone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially common among girls at all female institutions . <p> ' Bullying is generally considered a manly trait and girls bully each other less in co-ed schools as they are keen to show their feminine qualities . <p> School counsellors and educators say that bullying is especially common among girls at all female institutions <p> Female bullying is mostly verbal- mocking at their classmates ' clothes , height , complexion and weight , for instance . <p> Girls who do n't get their eyebrows plucked , hands and legs waxed or who prefer knee length socks over ankle length ones are the ' easy targets ' . <h> CYBER BULLYING NEEDS TACKLING <p> Described as the use of the Internet , cell phones , or other devices to transmit text or images to hurt or embarrass another person , cyberbullying is on the rise among kids in India , according to a poll conducted by global research firm Ipsos : Three out of ten Indian parents report that their children have been victims , and the problem is bigger in India than in the West .

Another is told that being charged means they have to give the police money . Two incidents cited by those opposed to the new system . <p> Courts in England and Wales previously hired freelance interpreters from a national register . Now they are provided by a single agency , Applied Language Solutions ( ALS ) , which has promised to cut the annual ? 60m translation bill by a third . <p> While the company says despite some \" teething troubles \" it is operating well , 60% of the 2,300 of those on the National Register of Public Service Interpreters are refusing to work for it after their pay was slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 , a quarter-hourly rate after three hours , and were paid for travel time and expenses - but this has been replaced by hourly fees in three tiers of ? 16 , ? 20 and ? 22 plus no travel time and reduced expenses . <p> In some cases , an interpreter 's pay would be halved for the same three hours of work , while those who used to travel long distances to assignments could be out of pocket . <p> For example , one Lithuanian interpreter who regularly travelled to Devon from Surrey and used to get ? 246 for a day 's shift would now be ? 65 down after travel costs . <h> Specialised job <p> Some fear the change could have more damaging consequences . The interpreters ' membership body , the Professional Interpreters Alliance , says the boycott is forcing ALS to employ people with little experience of the legal system . <p> \" We are already hearing horror stories from all over the country .

He was eventually dealt with on a third occasion , a week later . <p> One of the PIA interpreters listened to part of the interpreting during the cross-examination of the defendant and the closing speeches in a case at a crown court , which they described as \" very vague and incomplete \" . <p> They reported : \" I would say one fifth of what was being said in court was interpreted to the defendant .

"text": "<p> Check , courtesy of Lucky Chip , who are following in the Meatwagon 's footsteps , selling their delicious beef concoctions out of a van . Clean-off-the-bone ribs translated into a portable lunch ? <p> Mark ' The Ribman ' Gevaux will happily be your saviour if you venture to nearby Brick Lane on a Sunday . <p> Authentic wood-fired pizzas ? Local wunderkinds Homeslice have it covered , or at least they did until their doughy end-of-year success led them to pursue pop-up opportunities further afield , including an exciting , in-the-works project on Portobello Road . <p> For Gevaux , in particular , 2011 was a fantastic year , with The Long Table night market in Dalston , the success of his ' Holy Fuck ' hot sauce , and joining up with eat.st being particular highlights . <p> He puts the success of street food in Hackney down to the borough 's adventurous culture and relative affordability : \" One of the reasons street food has thrived in Hackney and not Kensington is that I ca n't see the people of Kensington sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum , \" he says . <p> \" They are missing out . Also , I should think the rents would price many of us out . I work on such a tight profit margin my prices would have to go up so much I would be embarrassed . \" <p> The rise of quality street food in London is going a long way to countering popular misconceptions about American-style dining . As anyone who has ever sampled proper Yankee fare will tell you , it 's a far cry from what 's peddled at McDonald 's and TGI Friday 's . <p> Even the humble hot dog -- usually linked to dodgy vendors in Leicester Square and even dodgier tummies -- has experienced a renaissance on Old Street in the hands of the permanently cheerful Abiye and his gleaming Big Apple Hot Dog cart . <p> According to Pizza man George Whiting of Homeslice , Hackney 's creative spirit as an important factor in the rise of its street food scene : \" Hackney has a young , creative culture at the moment and I think the street food culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it give talented people an opportunity to do their own thing without breaking the bank , but it helps rejuvenate otherwise disused areas . \" <p> Driven by the passion of people like Whiting and Gevaux , the future of street food looks bright indeed . A weekend stroll down another of 2011 's big success stories , Chatsworth Road market , showcases the full spectrum of local street eats : everything from the gourmet ethical offerings at Vegan Peasant to the warming pho and inspired fusion baguettes at longstanding Hackney favourites Bahnmi11 . <p> The taste for street food is also spreading to the upper echelons of the culinary world . Upmarket City and West End steakhouse Hawksmoor not only serve Big Apple hot dogs in their restaurants , they recently traded suits for skinny jeans and set up shop at The Long Table in Dalston . And Abiye 's hot dogs now feature at man-of-the-moment Russell Norman 's new joint , Mishkins . <p> Only a few years ago , this street food revolution seemed like the pipedream of a few madmen ( and women ) willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taste of the real deal . But happen it did . And perhaps , given that sherry has morphed from Nan 's afternoon pick-me-up into a hip tipple in the space of just twelve months , that 's not so surprising after all . ",

"title": "Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies, By Ben Macintyre\n",
"text": "<h> Double Cross : The True Story of the D-Day Spies , By Ben Macintyre <p> After the Second World War , a Catalan former chicken-farmer named Juan Pujol retired to Venezuela , where he taught Spanish to Shell staff and ran a bookshop . This literary destiny seems more than apt . Between 1942 and 1945 , while living in a nondescript semi in Hendon with a disgruntled wife and a dull cover job at the BBC , Pujol -- \" Agent Garbo \" to his real controllers at MI5 -- contributed several decisive chapters to perhaps the most spectacularly effective work of fiction in modern history . <p> Together with his double-agent colleagues , some of whose stories Ben Macintyre weaves into the latest of his enjoyable and engrossing books about wartime subterfuge and deception , Garbo fashioned a \" limitless , multi-character , ever-expanding novel \" . It was designed to deceive the Germans about every aspect of the preparations for D-Day . From 1942 , every \" German \" source in Britain worked for the Allies , with the bizarre multi-national band of Double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dry , cricket-fanatic chief John Masterman . <p> By June 1944 , when the double-crossers achieved what Macintyre calls their \" world-changing triumph \" , Operation Fortitude had managed to persuade the German high command that the Normandy landings were merely \" a starter before the main course \" . That , the Wehrmacht believed with \" unshakeable \" conviction , would take the form of a massive invasion of the Pas de Calais across the narrowest point of the Channel by an ( entirely fictional ) First US Army Group under General Patton , with side-order attacks aimed at Norway and the Atlantic coast around Bordeaux . <p> Did this intricate tissue of fibs help to win the war ? The military evidence looks compelling . A month after D-Day , 22 German divisions were still held back from the Normandy front . An order to move the formidable 1st Panzer Division there was rescinded specifically because Garbo , in his florid \" rococo \" despatches , warned that Normandy would be a diversion . <p> Some historians remain sceptical about the value of Second World War deception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Front crumbling and the German officer elite in near-open revolt against Hitler , the D-Day forces would have prevailed without the rich diet of disinformation fed to Berlin by the agents . Writers about espionage ( Macintyre included ) feel a natural affinity for keyboard warriors who spin colourful yarns that command assent , and tend to overegg their tasty pudding . <p> In spite of these caveats , Garbo and his deeply eccentric colleagues undoubtedly saved countless lives . In his history of D-Day , the level-headed Antony Beevor writes that Fortitude \" proved more effective than the Alllies had ever dared imagine \" . Macintyre 's gripping yarns may bring no major revisions to our map of the secret war : Joshua Levine 's book on Fortitude appeared only last year . But they do show with captivating panache the debt that Allied victory owed to these oddball storytellers , who wove around the actual army that liberated Europe a \" bodyguard of lies \" . <p> In addition to Garbo , Macintyre traces the flights of fantasy foisted on their German handlers by Dusko Popov ( \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by Elvira de la Fuente Chaudoir ( \" Bronx \" ) , the bisexual Peruvian socialite and gambler ; by Lily Sergeyev ( \" Treasure \" ) , the volatile French-Russian agent who almost scuppered Fortitude because the British terminated her beloved dog Babs ; and by the Polish undercover specialist Roman Czerniawski ( \" Brutus \" ) , a tough pro among this cast of high-maintenance amateur primadonnas . <p> But did the Abwehr ( German military intelligence ) really swallow all the fabrications that MI5 's shadow warriors fed them , prudently mixed with non-essential truth ? As Macintyre 's tale unfolds , we come to ask how much this notoriously \" disloyal \" weak link in the Nazi chain tacitly connived in strategic blunders that would hasten the downfall of the Reich . Messages intercepted at Bletchley Park by the Enigma code-breakers prove that Garbo and friends apparently retained their kudos and credibility until D-Day and beyond . However , a suspicion remains that anti-Nazi officers -- right up to Alexis von Roenne , who digested and presented intelligence for Hitler - had rumbled the Double Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its splendidly weird ploys and feints ( spy-pigeons figure frequently ) , Macintyre 's book culminates in a stirring account of old-fashioned courage . \" Worldly , cynical , dissolute \" , the German case-officer Johnny Jebsen - Popov 's handler - was a louche playboy , high-society fraudster and PG Wodehouse fan . Always covertly anti-Nazi , he had been \" turned \" by MI5 in 1943 . In April 1944 , Jebsen was kidnapped in Lisbon and spirited to Berlin . It seems that anti-Hitler officers feared he might unwittingly derail their plans to kill the F ? hrer . <p> Once in the capital , though , pro-regime interrogators took charge . He was taken to the Gestapo prison . On the eve of D-Day , Jebsen -- whom everyone assumed would instantly crack and squeal -- could have wrecked Fortitude . Yet , reduced by weeks of torture and maltreatment to a just-living skeleton , he said not a single word . Macintyre salutes the astonishing bravery of a hedonist-turned-hero .

"lower_text": "<h> double cross : the true story of the d-day spies , by ben macintyre <p> after the second world war , a catalan former chicken-farmer named juan pujol retired to venezuela , where he taught spanish to shell staff and ran a bookshop . this literary destiny seems more than apt . between 1942 and 1945 , while living in a nondescript semi in hendon with a disgruntled wife and a dull cover job at the bbc , pujol -- \" agent garbo \" to his real controllers at mi5 -- contributed several decisive chapters to perhaps the most spectacularly effective work of fiction in modern history . <p> together with his double-agent colleagues , some of whose stories ben macintyre weaves into the latest of his enjoyable and engrossing books about wartime subterfuge and deception , garbo fashioned a \" limitless , multi-character , ever-expanding novel \" . it was designed to deceive the germans about every aspect of the preparations for d-day . from 1942 , every \" german \" source in britain worked for the allies , with the bizarre multi-national band of double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dry , cricket-fanatic chief john masterman . <p> by june 1944 , when the double-crossers achieved what macintyre calls their \" world-changing triumph \" , operation fortitude had managed to persuade the german high command that the normandy landings were merely \" a starter before the main course \" . that , the wehrmacht believed with \" unshakeable \" conviction , would take the form of a massive invasion of the pas de calais across the narrowest point of the channel by an ( entirely fictional ) first us army group under general patton , with side-order attacks aimed at norway and the atlantic coast around bordeaux . <p> did this intricate tissue of fibs help to win the war ? the military evidence looks compelling . a month after d-day , 22 german divisions were still held back from the normandy front . an order to move the formidable 1st panzer division there was rescinded specifically because garbo , in his florid \" rococo \" despatches , warned that normandy would be a diversion . <p> some historians remain sceptical about the value of second world war deception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern front crumbling and the german officer elite in near-open revolt against hitler , the d-day forces would have prevailed without the rich diet of disinformation fed to berlin by the agents . writers about espionage ( macintyre included ) feel a natural affinity for keyboard warriors who spin colourful yarns that command assent , and tend to overegg their tasty pudding . <p> in spite of these caveats , garbo and his deeply eccentric colleagues undoubtedly saved countless lives . in his history of d-day , the level-headed antony beevor writes that fortitude \" proved more effective than the alllies had ever dared imagine \" . macintyre 's gripping yarns may bring no major revisions to our map of the secret war : joshua levine 's book on fortitude appeared only last year . but they do show with captivating panache the debt that allied victory owed to these oddball storytellers , who wove around the actual army that liberated europe a \" bodyguard of lies \" . <p> in addition to garbo , macintyre traces the flights of fantasy foisted on their german handlers by dusko popov ( \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by elvira de la fuente chaudoir ( \" bronx \" ) , the bisexual peruvian socialite and gambler ; by lily sergeyev ( \" treasure \" ) , the volatile french-russian agent who almost scuppered fortitude because the british terminated her beloved dog babs ; and by the polish undercover specialist roman czerniawski ( \" brutus \" ) , a tough pro among this cast of high-maintenance amateur primadonnas . <p> but did the abwehr ( german military intelligence ) really swallow all the fabrications that mi5 's shadow warriors fed them , prudently mixed with non-essential truth ? as macintyre 's tale unfolds , we come to ask how much this notoriously \" disloyal \" weak link in the nazi chain tacitly connived in strategic blunders that would hasten the downfall of the reich . messages intercepted at bletchley park by the enigma code-breakers prove that garbo and friends apparently retained their kudos and credibility until d-day and beyond . however , a suspicion remains that anti-nazi officers -- right up to alexis von roenne , who digested and presented intelligence for hitler - had rumbled the double cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its splendidly weird ploys and feints ( spy-pigeons figure frequently ) , macintyre 's book culminates in a stirring account of old-fashioned courage . \" worldly , cynical , dissolute \" , the german case-officer johnny jebsen - popov 's handler - was a louche playboy , high-society fraudster and pg wodehouse fan . always covertly anti-nazi , he had been \" turned \" by mi5 in 1943 . in april 1944 , jebsen was kidnapped in lisbon and spirited to berlin . it seems that anti-hitler officers feared he might unwittingly derail their plans to kill the f ? hrer . <p> once in the capital , though , pro-regime interrogators took charge . he was taken to the gestapo prison . on the eve of d-day , jebsen -- whom everyone assumed would instantly crack and squeal -- could have wrecked fortitude . yet , reduced by weeks of torture and maltreatment to a just-living skeleton , he said not a single word . macintyre salutes the astonishing bravery of a hedonist-turned-hero . and this ramifying network of improbable , often comic , fraud and fiction reaches its fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- broken in body , but not in spirit - who clung at death 's door to the code of the woosters : \" never let a pal down \" .

That 's your problem , yeah . \" <p> The case was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission who passed the file to the Crown Prosecution Service . <p> It was initially decided not to prosecute Mr MacFarlane , but the case was reviewed after the man 's lawyers complained . <p> The CPS has now concluded that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction \" . <p> The announcement came as the police watchdog announced a review of a string of complaints about racism at the Metropolitan Police , warning of the risks of \" much wider disaffection and dissatisfaction \" with the force . <p> There are now 11 separate allegations under investigation , involving 10 police officers . <p> Alison Saunders , chief prosecutor for London , said she had advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge PC MacFarlane despite the CPS 's decision not to charge him in January . <p> \" In March , the complainant 's lawyers challenged that decision and , in accordance with standard CPS practice , Grace Ononiwu , Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London , directed that the case be reviewed by a more senior lawyer who was not previously involved . <p> \" That review is now complete and the conclusion , based on all the evidence now available , is that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction to charge PC MacFarlane with a racially aggravated public order offence contrary to Section 4a of the Public Order Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 . <p> \" When a review shows a previous decision not to prosecute is wrong , it is open to the CPS to rectify that error by bringing new proceedings . \" <p> Ms Saunders said the original CPS decision was \" regrettable \" , adding that a prosecution was necessary to maintain public confidence . <p> PC MacFarlane was stripped of his duties in relation to the mobile phone footage . <p> The arrested man , named as Mauro Demetrio , 21 , from Beckton , east London , was held on suspicion of drug-driving in August last year but no action was later taken . <p> The charging announcement came as Met Commissioner Bernard-Hogan Howe appeared before MPs over the force 's review of racist allegations . <p> Ms Saunders said : \" As Chief Crown Prosecutor for London , I have taken the decision in this case that , as well as there being sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction , and a prosecution being in the public interest , a prosecution is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Code for Crown Prosecutors when reinstituting a prosecution . <p> \" Accordingly , I have advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge PC MacFarlane . <p> \" It is regrettable that the original decision was wrong , but I hope the action taken and my decision today demonstrates the willingness of the CPS to review its decisions independently and swiftly and to take appropriate action where necessary . \" <p> An additional charge of assault relating to an allegation of \" strangulation \" will not be pursued , the CPS said . <p> Ms Saunders added : \" However , having now had opportunity to consider all available evidence , including the statements of others in the van alongside the recording , the lawyer reviewing the case concluded that the inconsistencies in the various accounts of what happened were such that no additional charge could properly be added . <p> \" The inconsistencies included a dispute over the identity of the officer who took hold of the complainant - the complainant said that this was one officer but all other witnesses dispute this . <p> \" There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took hold of the complaint , did so .

"text": "<h> Pinterest is a digital corkboard that shows other people what like from around the internet . Here 's how to create an account and use the website . <h> Step-by-step guide to the new online pinboard <p> Facebook and Twitter are obvious ways of sharing things on the web that you like , as of course is a personal blog or website . But there 's now a new way of sharing your favourite web items . Pinterest is a digital corkboard that shows other people what you rate , what looks cute or appeals from a design or engineering point of view . <p> If you 're an avid user of all things Google , Gmail , Picasa , Blogger and YouTube , sharing items via Google+ may seem a more obvious option , while newshounds may prefer Digg . Pinterest offers a different slant , in which peer ratings are important . You indicate your admiration of other pinners ' taste in items on the web by having them on your Pinterest boards and following them , if you wish . Unlike Twitter , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop off the radar , pinned items stay on your page , ready for other people to delve into . <p> As with most social media websites , tags are at the heart of Pinterest . Having a decent photo or two also helps pique other peoples ' interest . The site is based around interest boards that you contribute to , create and share , and Pinterest provides a selection of popular topic boards to get you started . The more ' pins ' a site or a Pinterest user acquires , the higher their Pinterest ranking . To see what 's popular , check out the ' Popular ' link on the Pinterest home page . It could n't be simpler . <p> You can follow or unfollow any Pinterest member you wish , just as you can with Twittter . If you 've linked your Pinterest account with Facebook rather than Twitter , it 's ' Likes ' that you 're after . <p> Pinterest is nominally still an invite-only beta website . Yet , it has more than 12 million members and - in the US - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinterest in March noted that UK usage is currently weighted the other way ; male users have embraced it . <p> Pinterest originally invited craft and fashion bloggers to try out the service when it was in closed beta and there 's still a big focus on homespun choices such as family , home , DIY &amp; crafts , fashion and cooking and the boards Pinterest suggests reflect this . More ' male ' interests such as technology , cars and science are listed at the bottom of the initial home page , out of sight until you scroll down . You can add your own Pinterest category ; the default list is rather safe . <p> As the site develops and new members with different interests join , these listings will change . As with all things social on the web , from Digg to YouTube to Twitter , Pinterest is user-driven and is shaped by members ' likes . What makes it more than of fleeting interest in that , unlike Twitter , it 's not ephemeral . What you pin is a public , permanently accessible log of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just hope Google does n't find a way of monetising such a concept and tracking what we view and pin for the benefit of ad traffickers everywhere . <h> How to get started with Pinterest <p> 1 . Request a login at Pinterest.com or accept an invitation from a friend . Your email address and a password are all you need . Click on any of the preset interest boards you wish and follow any that look particularly interesting . The Find friends option under your Account photo is a good starting point for finding and sharing pins with like-minded Facebook and email friends . <p> 2 . To start interacting on Pinterest it 's easiest to add a bookmark for each of your boards in your web browser . These are actually bookmarklets - tiny applications that allow you to add items to your Pinterest stash just by clicking on them when you stumble across something interesting on the web . In Safari and Chrome , for example , you just drag the Pin It bookmark to the bookmark bar . <p> 3 . Another useful tool native to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to browsing Pinterest boards due to their visual appeal and the way they seamlessly lead on to each other . If you want to find something specific -- attractive business card ideas , for example -- head straight for Search . Bear this in mind when tagging and naming your own pins . <p> 4 . If you find something you like on someone else 's board , click to ' repin ' it and add it to yours . This also has the effect of raising the item 's profile and that of its original ' pinner ' . You can also share Likes and links via Twitter and Facebook by optionally sharing your repin . <p> 5 . Click Pinners you follow at the top of the screen to see the latest updates from them . You can curate your own Pinterest boards too . Click on something you like . If it does n't fit neatly into one of the boards you 're following , scroll down to the bottom of the Repin menuand click in the field to create one of your own . <p> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share items you like and have stumbled across -- you need to pin original items . Pinterest etiquette dictates that the original pinner gets credit for repins . Click the Add button next to your profile , choose Add a pin and then copy the pertinent page link . You can also upload images . A good photo and description will help ensure your pin is found . <p> 7 . Videos as well as photos can be shared on Pinterest . Channels for each are listed at the top of the page . You can also use Pinterest to market your products ( be wary of overpromotion so you are n't deemed a spammer ) and to showcase your own talents to potential employees . Items for sale are listed under Gifts by rough price range . Note that when you type in a figure and it will appear in US dollars . <p> 8 . Cute works well on Pinterest , but it also works well for spammers . As with any website , you should be wary of the links you click on . We clicked on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodgy photos and phishing are rare , but Pinterest provides a reporting tool for these and spam to the right of each entry . <p> 9 . Once you 're following a few pinners and have several boards , it can be hard to keep up with the additions to Pinterest . For desktop use , Pinterest is easy enough to control via your web page .

"lower_text": "<h> pinterest is a digital corkboard that shows other people what like from around the internet . here 's how to create an account and use the website . <h> step-by-step guide to the new online pinboard <p> facebook and twitter are obvious ways of sharing things on the web that you like , as of course is a personal blog or website . but there 's now a new way of sharing your favourite web items . pinterest is a digital corkboard that shows other people what you rate , what looks cute or appeals from a design or engineering point of view . <p> if you 're an avid user of all things google , gmail , picasa , blogger and youtube , sharing items via google+ may seem a more obvious option , while newshounds may prefer digg . pinterest offers a different slant , in which peer ratings are important . you indicate your admiration of other pinners ' taste in items on the web by having them on your pinterest boards and following them , if you wish . unlike twitter , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop off the radar , pinned items stay on your page , ready for other people to delve into . <p> as with most social media websites , tags are at the heart of pinterest . having a decent photo or two also helps pique other peoples ' interest . the site is based around interest boards that you contribute to , create and share , and pinterest provides a selection of popular topic boards to get you started . the more ' pins ' a site or a pinterest user acquires , the higher their pinterest ranking . to see what 's popular , check out the ' popular ' link on the pinterest home page . it could n't be simpler . <p> you can follow or unfollow any pinterest member you wish , just as you can with twittter . if you 've linked your pinterest account with facebook rather than twitter , it 's ' likes ' that you 're after . <p> pinterest is nominally still an invite-only beta website . yet , it has more than 12 million members and - in the us - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinterest in march noted that uk usage is currently weighted the other way ; male users have embraced it . <p> pinterest originally invited craft and fashion bloggers to try out the service when it was in closed beta and there 's still a big focus on homespun choices such as family , home , diy &amp; crafts , fashion and cooking and the boards pinterest suggests reflect this . more ' male ' interests such as technology , cars and science are listed at the bottom of the initial home page , out of sight until you scroll down . you can add your own pinterest category ; the default list is rather safe . <p> as the site develops and new members with different interests join , these listings will change . as with all things social on the web , from digg to youtube to twitter , pinterest is user-driven and is shaped by members ' likes . what makes it more than of fleeting interest in that , unlike twitter , it 's not ephemeral . what you pin is a public , permanently accessible log of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just hope google does n't find a way of monetising such a concept and tracking what we view and pin for the benefit of ad traffickers everywhere . <h> how to get started with pinterest <p> 1 . request a login at pinterest.com or accept an invitation from a friend . your email address and a password are all you need . click on any of the preset interest boards you wish and follow any that look particularly interesting . the find friends option under your account photo is a good starting point for finding and sharing pins with like-minded facebook and email friends . <p> 2 . to start interacting on pinterest it 's easiest to add a bookmark for each of your boards in your web browser . these are actually bookmarklets - tiny applications that allow you to add items to your pinterest stash just by clicking on them when you stumble across something interesting on the web . in safari and chrome , for example , you just drag the pin it bookmark to the bookmark bar . <p> 3 . another useful tool native to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to browsing pinterest boards due to their visual appeal and the way they seamlessly lead on to each other . if you want to find something specific -- attractive business card ideas , for example -- head straight for search . bear this in mind when tagging and naming your own pins . <p> 4 . if you find something you like on someone else 's board , click to ' repin ' it and add it to yours . this also has the effect of raising the item 's profile and that of its original ' pinner ' . you can also share likes and links via twitter and facebook by optionally sharing your repin . <p> 5 . click pinners you follow at the top of the screen to see the latest updates from them . you can curate your own pinterest boards too . click on something you like . if it does n't fit neatly into one of the boards you 're following , scroll down to the bottom of the repin menuand click in the field to create one of your own . <p> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share items you like and have stumbled across -- you need to pin original items . pinterest etiquette dictates that the original pinner gets credit for repins . click the add button next to your profile , choose add a pin and then copy the pertinent page link . you can also upload images . a good photo and description will help ensure your pin is found . <p> 7 . videos as well as photos can be shared on pinterest . channels for each are listed at the top of the page . you can also use pinterest to market your products ( be wary of overpromotion so you are n't deemed a spammer ) and to showcase your own talents to potential employees . items for sale are listed under gifts by rough price range . note that when you type in a figure and it will appear in us dollars . <p> 8 . cute works well on pinterest , but it also works well for spammers . as with any website , you should be wary of the links you click on . we clicked on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodgy photos and phishing are rare , but pinterest provides a reporting tool for these and spam to the right of each entry . <p> 9 . once you 're following a few pinners and have several boards , it can be hard to keep up with the additions to pinterest . for desktop use , pinterest is easy enough to control via your web page . on the road , a smartphone app is ideal for uploading and sharing pins . there 's a free pinterest app for ios plus a handful of third-party ones , while android and windows phone users can use pinsensation.

"title": "Where Mormonism meets Scientology\n",
"text": "<h> Damian Thompson is Editor of Telegraph Blogs and a columnist for the Daily Telegraph . He was once described by The Church Times as a \" blood-crazed ferret \" . He is on Twitter as HolySmoke . His latest book is The Fix : How addiction is taking over your world . He also writes about classical music for The Spectator . <h> Where Mormonism meets Scientology <p> We can take it for granted that Tom Cruise -- whose divorce proceedings are already such a catastrophe for Scientology -- will never talk in public about Xenu . The existence of this intergalactic emperor , who flourished c 75,000,000 BC , was top secret until the Church 's enemies took to the internet . Advice to journalists : if you ask Cruise about Xenu , the doors of Hollywood ( where the Church wields immense influence ) will slam in your face . <p> On the other hand , it 's safe to ask any Scientologist about Kolob . This is the star , or possibly planet , that is closest to the throne of God . Astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the inspiration for the planet Kobol in Battlestar Galactica . <p> Why is it safe to ask Cruise about Kolob ? Because it 's Mormon , not Scientologist : it appears in The Book of Abraham , \" translated \" from Egyptian papyri by Joseph Smith , the founder of Mormonism . I use inverted commas because Smith could n't read Egyptian . The papyri were funerary texts . <p> The person you must n't ask about Kolob is Mitt Romney . The teaching is n't a secret , but Latter-day Saints are n't keen to discuss it . These days they stress their similarity with Christianity , and there 's no Kolob in the Gospels . <p> Admittedly , from a secular point of view , eating bread in the belief that it 's the body of a **25;184;TOOLONG who rose from the dead is as bizarre as hooking yourself up to an E-meter , like Scientologists , or baptising the dead , like Mormons . Yet there are striking similarities between the sects founded by Joseph Smith and L Ron Hubbard . These brilliant mavericks used popular culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some esoteric details for senior initiates . <p> Smith invented a journey by ancient Hebrews to America -- a typical fantasy of the time -- and dabbled in the occult . Hubbard mined the seam of mid-20th-century American science fiction , and also devised a brain-cleansing technique called Dianetics that was supposed to produce perfect recall . It failed hilariously . <p> Critics accused Smith and Hubbard of telling porkies . The former 's interpretation of the Egyptian papyri , which he encountered in a travelling mummy exhibition , is plain embarrassing . As for Hubbard , his war service was a work of the imagination to rival the science fiction he wrote before he discovered religion and its tax-exempt status . Both organisations are extremely interested in money , and very good at acquiring it . <p> The two prophets were heartily interested in the opposite sex : Smith acquired some 33 wives , while Hubbard encouraged teenage girl \" officers \" to wear hot pants . <p> Also , both religions went down the paramilitary route . We 've read this week about the \" Sea Org \" that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join ( a claim denied by the Church ) . But that 's nothing compared with the Mormon militia which fought in the Mexican-American war . Later , Mormon \" avenging angels \" were implicated in blood-curdling murders after they moved to Utah . <p> The Latter-day Saints cleaned up their act . But they were the Scientologists of their day -- and they 're still evasive enough for the public to make the subliminal connection . <p> That 's why Mitt Romney , who dresses like a Mormon but flashes a Scientologist 's smile , must be worried by the Cruise-Holmes divorce . This year of all years , he does n't want the word \" cult \" splashed all over the front pages . <p> Why are we paying for agitprop ? <p> The BBC 's new director-general , George Entwistle , is a former editor of Newsnight . I wonder if he knows how much damage is being done to its reputation by Paul Mason , its economics editor ? Mason was in the Guardian on Monday , sucking up to student protesters . In the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of Lefty who rants about the ' end of the neoliberal experiment ' between interviews with dreadlocked , dope-smoking hippies squatting in some Arab oil trader 's Chelsea townhouse \" . George , if you think this man is impartial , why not go the whole hog and give Polly Toynbee her old job back as the Beeb 's social affairs editor ? <p> Hattie : do n't mention her size <p> Eric Sykes , who died this week , was one of the gentlemen of comedy . His kindness was on display in an interview he gave about Hattie Jacques , who played his sister on television . \" Hat was n't a small woman , \" he said , \" but we never mentioned her size . \" <p> She was indeed a large lass -- married , improbably , to John Le Mesurier . Fat ladies were one of the comic obsessions of the seaside-postcard era , perhaps because they were rare . That 's less true today , when coffee shops encourage women to eat \" muffins \" ( ie , high-density lumps of cake ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Starbucks , no one would notice her girth . <p> Not that I 'm preaching , you understand . In these troubled times , why should n't the fairer sex seek solace in sponge ? <p> A whiff of Vichy in the Synod <p> At the time of writing , I do not know whether the Church of England 's General Synod has voted to ordain women bishops outright , to adopt some risible compromise , or to prolong the agony for a few more years . Agony of boredom , that is . Let me save you the trouble of following the proceedings with a cut-out-'n ' -keep guide to this tedious debate . You need to know just two things . <p> First , there 's overwhelming support in the pews for women bishops .

"lower_text": "<h> damian thompson is editor of telegraph blogs and a columnist for the daily telegraph . he was once described by the church times as a \" blood-crazed ferret \" . he is on twitter as holysmoke . his latest book is the fix : how addiction is taking over your world . he also writes about classical music for the spectator . <h> where mormonism meets scientology <p> we can take it for granted that tom cruise -- whose divorce proceedings are already such a catastrophe for scientology -- will never talk in public about xenu . the existence of this intergalactic emperor , who flourished c 75,000,000 bc , was top secret until the church 's enemies took to the internet . advice to journalists : if you ask cruise about xenu , the doors of hollywood ( where the church wields immense influence ) will slam in your face . <p> on the other hand , it 's safe to ask any scientologist about kolob . this is the star , or possibly planet , that is closest to the throne of god . astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the inspiration for the planet kobol in battlestar galactica . <p> why is it safe to ask cruise about kolob ? because it 's mormon , not scientologist : it appears in the book of abraham , \" translated \" from egyptian papyri by joseph smith , the founder of mormonism . i use inverted commas because smith could n't read egyptian . the papyri were funerary texts . <p> the person you must n't ask about kolob is mitt romney . the teaching is n't a secret , but latter-day saints are n't keen to discuss it . these days they stress their similarity with christianity , and there 's no kolob in the gospels . <p> admittedly , from a secular point of view , eating bread in the belief that it 's the body of a **25;184;toolong who rose from the dead is as bizarre as hooking yourself up to an e-meter , like scientologists , or baptising the dead , like mormons . yet there are striking similarities between the sects founded by joseph smith and l ron hubbard . these brilliant mavericks used popular culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some esoteric details for senior initiates . <p> smith invented a journey by ancient hebrews to america -- a typical fantasy of the time -- and dabbled in the occult . hubbard mined the seam of mid-20th-century american science fiction , and also devised a brain-cleansing technique called dianetics that was supposed to produce perfect recall . it failed hilariously . <p> critics accused smith and hubbard of telling porkies . the former 's interpretation of the egyptian papyri , which he encountered in a travelling mummy exhibition , is plain embarrassing . as for hubbard , his war service was a work of the imagination to rival the science fiction he wrote before he discovered religion and its tax-exempt status . both organisations are extremely interested in money , and very good at acquiring it . <p> the two prophets were heartily interested in the opposite sex : smith acquired some 33 wives , while hubbard encouraged teenage girl \" officers \" to wear hot pants . <p> also , both religions went down the paramilitary route . we 've read this week about the \" sea org \" that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join ( a claim denied by the church ) . but that 's nothing compared with the mormon militia which fought in the mexican-american war . later , mormon \" avenging angels \" were implicated in blood-curdling murders after they moved to utah . <p> the latter-day saints cleaned up their act . but they were the scientologists of their day -- and they 're still evasive enough for the public to make the subliminal connection . <p> that 's why mitt romney , who dresses like a mormon but flashes a scientologist 's smile , must be worried by the cruise-holmes divorce . this year of all years , he does n't want the word \" cult \" splashed all over the front pages . <p> why are we paying for agitprop ? <p> the bbc 's new director-general , george entwistle , is a former editor of newsnight . i wonder if he knows how much damage is being done to its reputation by paul mason , its economics editor ? mason was in the guardian on monday , sucking up to student protesters . in the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of lefty who rants about the ' end of the neoliberal experiment ' between interviews with dreadlocked , dope-smoking hippies squatting in some arab oil trader 's chelsea townhouse \" . george , if you think this man is impartial , why not go the whole hog and give polly toynbee her old job back as the beeb 's social affairs editor ? <p> hattie : do n't mention her size <p> eric sykes , who died this week , was one of the gentlemen of comedy . his kindness was on display in an interview he gave about hattie jacques , who played his sister on television . \" hat was n't a small woman , \" he said , \" but we never mentioned her size . \" <p> she was indeed a large lass -- married , improbably , to john le mesurier . fat ladies were one of the comic obsessions of the seaside-postcard era , perhaps because they were rare . that 's less true today , when coffee shops encourage women to eat \" muffins \" ( ie , high-density lumps of cake ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a starbucks , no one would notice her girth . <p> not that i 'm preaching , you understand . in these troubled times , why should n't the fairer sex seek solace in sponge ? <p> a whiff of vichy in the synod <p> at the time of writing , i do not know whether the church of england 's general synod has voted to ordain women bishops outright , to adopt some risible compromise , or to prolong the agony for a few more years . agony of boredom , that is . let me save you the trouble of following the proceedings with a cut-out-'n ' -keep guide to this tedious debate . you need to know just two things . <p> first , there 's overwhelming support in the pews for women bishops . second , the anglo-catholic \" traditionalists \" who want to stay in the church of england behind some sort of firewall are deluded . having turned down the pope 's offer of reunion with rome , the most they can hope for is a playpen inside a wider liberal protestant denomination . as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that they can stay untainted by the changes . not to be rude , but perhaps they should think of organising a pilgrimage to marshal p ?

Picture : Steve Reid ( 122494-900 ) <h> Chris Owen <p> All it took was a click of the mouse for David Neale to find the father he never knew . <p> He was aware his dad had been an amateur international road racing motorcyclist , but that was about it . <h> MEAN MACHINE John Bacon in action <p> What he never knew was the high level at which he raced , the esteem in which he was held by the biking community and the man behind the leathers and helmet . <p> It was a frustration which meant the life of the 47-year-old was never really complete . <p> But that ended earlier this year when an aunt and cousin Googled his dad 's name and up popped a picture and information about him . <p> ' It was the first time I 'd ever had any concrete details about him . I 'd searched the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any luck , ' says David . <p> And that random search has now led to David and his sister Linda being invited as guests of honour to a moving ceremony at the spot where their father died . <p> John Bacon was just 31 when he died in a crash during a road race at Tubbergen in the Netherlands in 1965 . His sister Linda was two and their mother , Jean , was six months pregnant with David . <p> That post on the vintagebike.co.uk website was compiled by Arthur West , an old racing friend and it enabled David to start piecing together details of his father 's life . <p> His discovered that , riding a Norton , he finished 12th out of 41 in the lightweight bike class of the 1960 Isle of Man TT . He even beat the legendary Mike Hailwood who went on to become one of the few men to compete at Grand Prix level on motorcycles and in cars . <p> ' It was his first and only Isle of Man TT and the record shows that over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course , his average speed was 76.19mph , ' says David , who took the name of his mother 's second husband when she remarried after his father 's death . <p> ' As a result of that website posting , Linda asked for anyone who knew our father to contact us . We were anxious to find out at much as we could about him because my sister was only two and I was three months off being born when he died . <p> ' And out of the blue a chap called Richard Morley replied . He was my dad 's best friend . They 'd grown up together in Woking . They both started on cycle speedway for the Old Woking Jets before eventually taking up club , national and international motorcycle racing . ' Richard went on to become the managing director of Lotus Europe . <p> That contact with Richard led to an invitation from Holland . It came from the Tubbergen Motorcycle Racing Club which wanted David , his sister and Richard to be their guests in May at the unveiling of a memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual Tubbergen road race . <p> And one of the names on that memorial belongs to their father . <p> David , who lives with his wife Emma and their two children at Zeus Lane , Crookhorn , and is a long-distance lorry driver , adds : ' We 'd never met them before but they made us feel so welcome . We were treated like royalty . <p> ' The new track is only about 1.5km long and racing now takes place around what is really an industrial estate . <p> ' But when my father raced in 1965 the circuit was 10km long . The race went through three towns and in its heyday 60,000 spectators would watch the race . <p> ' It was the second most-watched motorcycling event behind Assen where the Dutch TT is held . The road racing stopped in the 1980s because of the traffic gridlock caused in surrounding town . ' <p> All the family and friends of those killed at the circuit between 1954 and 1972 were taken on a coach tour of the circuit and shown the exact spot where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says David . ' About 100 vintage motorcycles and their riders became guards of honour for the coach which stopped for a minute 's silence as we passed the spot where each of the five died . <p> ' When it stopped where my dad died , my sister and I got off the coach and looked at the two roses we had planted there earlier -- one orange , one white -- that had been intertwined to represent our mother and father being at one again . <p> ' At that point the guard of honour bikes went past with some riders nodding , some saluting . It was an extremely poignant moment for both of us . ' <p> But the links with his dashing father did not end there . <p> At the end of the day one of the Dutch organisers of the event asked David if there was anything else he would like to do . <p> David adds with a gleam in his eye : ' I told him what it was and he said he would get it arranged . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He came back , passed me a helmet and leather jacket and I was taken as a pillion passenger on a Suzuki 1000cc bike around the old Tubbergen road race circuit . <p> ' We got up to some incredible speeds and I felt the thrill my father would have experienced . <p> ' I had walked in my father 's footsteps and it made me feel incredibly proud of him . ' <p> ' It was going to be his last race ' <p> John Bacon had retired from competitive riding when he died on the Tubbergen road circuit in Holland . <p> David says : ' He wanted to ride one last time . It was going to be his last race . He had a two-year-old daughter and I was on the way . It turned out to be his very last ride , but not in the way he wanted . ' <p> John , who did his national service in the RAF , was a dental technician who moved to work in Switzerland to fund his motorcycling exploits . <p> David says boyhood friend Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' Apparently he even came up with the forerunner of Steradent to clean dentures .

' And it 's far more likely to come to you if it 's funny or just a bit weird .

Almost 900 people a year choke to death , while 29,000 die from heart attacks . It is a subject Ray is passionate about . He says : ' Just knowing the basics can save a life .

"text": "<h> Five world leaders ' favourite TV shows <p> 1 . Barack Obama - Homeland The leader of the free world is a former devotee of The Wire , but now finds ironic escapism in terrorist drama Homeland . \" Michelle goes out with the kids and they play tennis on a Saturday afternoon , \" Obama has admitted . \" I tell her I 'm going to work and then I go in my room and watch Homeland . \" <p> 2 . David Cameron - Shameless Man of the people Dave apparently keeps it real with Channel 4 's dose of low-brow sink-estate hyper-drama Shameless . \" Shameless is quite addictive , \" the PM has insisted , in perhaps his best defence against pomposity . But , apparently , only \" because it 's so awful \" . Have cake . Eat it . Done . <p> 3 . Bill Clinton - Grey 's Anatomy Of the high-octane medical drama that he and his spouse can not miss , the former American president once said , \" We both love Grey 's Anatomy and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 2008 presidential campaign began . \" <p> 4 . Margaret Thatcher - Yes Minister Such was Thatcher 's fondness for the Eighties BBC comedy , that she co-wrote ( with her press secretary , Bernard Ingham ) and appeared in a four-minute sketch for the show , where she farcically discussed the abolition of economists . Unsurprisingly , the sitcom was criticised for its pro-Thatcherite undertones . <p> 5 . Kim Jong-il - Desperate Housewives The late dictator had a surprising predilection for the gym-honed women of Wisteria Lane .

"text": "<p> Who would have thought you could buy a castle for ? 550,000 ? But you can . Inverquharity Castle has everything you could possibly want in the way of castle living : fascinating history dating from the 1440s ; walls 8ft thick ; a vaulted dining room and great hall ; a crenellated parapet ; an iron yett ( or gate ) to keep marauders out ; and staggering views from the battlements . <p> Sandy and Alisoun Grant bought Inverquharity in 1970 , after conducting an exhaustive search of all the tower houses of Scotland while on leave from West Africa , where Sandy worked as a lawyer . <p> \" It was built for the Ogilvy family who had it for 14 generations , \" says Alisoun . In 1444 , James II of Scotland granted permission to install a yett -- something given only to his most trusted subjects . <p> \" They moved out , and by the 1800s old maps show it was part of a flourishing farm . \" She explains all this as she removes a dripping hat after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pokes out of the landscape at the entrance to the Angus Glens . It is miles from anywhere : 20 from Dundee , 33 from Perth . It took three years to restore , with the help of an architectural specialist in historic buildings . <h> Related Articles <p> \" People say , oh you are terribly brave , but it is n't brave if you are doing something you want to do , \" says Alisoun . \" We did n't want a bijou little home . We could have gone uncompromisingly contemporary , which would have been spectacular , or concentrated on heavy oak . But we like late 17th-century furniture , which has a kind of subdued flamboyance . \" <p> They are selling as they find the turnpike stairs too hazardous as they grow older , and viewings have been frenetic . Alisoun has already shown around 19 interested buyers and has more to come . Everyone loves the idea of living in a castle , especially one like this , which is n't too large and has four bedrooms . <p> \" The building blossoms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , \" she says . \" We used to have one every Twelfth Night . We had an enormous Christmas tree in the great hall and fires roaring in the fireplaces . \" Knight Frank ( knightfrank.co.uk ; 0131 222 9600 ) is handling the sale . <p> Owning a castle carries responsibilities to restore , maintain and entertain like no other kind of property . They always have protected status as listed buildings or ancient monuments . Louise Burness , a daughter of the late Lord Charles Forte and a sister to the hotel magnate Sir Rocco Forte , had no idea what lay in store when she first fell in love with the ruins of Oxney Court at St Margaret's-at-Cliffe in Kent . The gaunt stump of the old castle , surrounded by ancient woodland close to the sea , worked its charms . <p> \" It had burnt down in 1914 , \" she says . \" But there was land and a cottage which was habitable . It was a romantic thing . We lived in London and visited at weekends while the work was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book , had the turrets added later and was occupied by Cistercian monks who farmed there . <p> \" Planning permission was difficult to get , \" says Louise . \" The council would n't let us have more than six bedrooms , with two in the cottage . \" No doubt there was a worry she would turn it into a hotel , as they tend to run in the family . <p> \" We had fantastic parties , masses of lovely celebrations , people staying every weekend . We tucked another two bedrooms into some outbuildings . Entertaining was easy because the kitchen is conveniently placed , and there are no narrow corridors leading to funny little rooms . \" The place is akin to a swish country house , with 35 acres , pool and tennis court . Strutt and Parker ( struttandparker.com ; 01227 451123 ) has it for sale for ? 4.5 million . <p> Most castles require a budget of at least ? 1 million to ? 2 million . This might not get you a star castle in a filmset moat , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for defence . <p> \" The joy is that everyone who buys a castle is someone who puts romance before practicality , \" says Jamie McNab of Savills . They are loved by the Scottish diaspora and by Americans . The ultimate trophy house , then ? \" Absolutely . Perfect for people who love entertaining . \" <p> He is selling Castle Gogar , on the edge of the Edinburgh green belt , a creamy , crenellated Scots baronial-style castle dating back to 1625 , restored to 21st-century millionaire standards . Savills ( savills.co.uk ; 0131 247 3711 ) has listed it at ? 2.9 million . It has five bedrooms , five bathrooms , a two-bedroom wing , outbuildings with a gym and games room , floodlit man ? ge and four paddocks . Yet it still has castle features : a vaulted crypt ; tower room ; battlements ; and turrets with arrow slots . <p> More cosy is The Dowery House , which sits near the village of Ford , 12 miles out of Edinburgh .

"text": "<p> CERN , home of the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , has seen a tenfold surge in candidates applying for hard-to-fill vacancies , after turning to social media . <p> CERN , based in Geneva , says it has seen the number of applicants for typical jobs grow from 30 to 50 to over 500 during the last 12 months . <p> The nuclear research establishment has transformed its recruitment processes by replacing one-off ads in specialist publications and on job sites with recruitment on Twitter , Facebook and investing in cloud-based recruitment platforms . <p> Over the past six months , it has attracted over 500 referrals from Facebook alone , said James Purvis , head of talent acquisition at CERN . <p> \" Facebook is a massive referral network . A lot of people are finding out about jobs from friends of friends , \" Purvis told Computer Weekly . <p> The organisation , which recruits between 200 permanent staff each year , has traditionally relied on its high-profile brand to attract suitable candidates . <h> The Large Hiring Challenge <p> But CERN has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem known internally as the Large Hiring Challenge . <p> \" People think you have to be a particle physicist to work at CERN , but we employ very few physicists . We need technicians , engineers , accountants , lawyers , and firefighters , \" said Purvis , speaking ahead of a conference on HR technology . <h> Got the job -- now read the T Shirt <p> Sometimes the low tech , or even the no-tech solution to recruitment is the best approach , says James Purvis , head of talent acquisition at CERN . <p> The research organisation recently had to come up with an innovative solution to overcome a major shortage of Java engineers . <p> \" We tried all the different job boards , job postings and social media . We tried videos on YouTube , we put posts on Facebook and on Java job boards , \" said Purvis . <p> In the end , the answer proved much simpler . <p> \" We realised that our Java engineers are presenting at numerous conferences in Europe and the US , \" he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals and specialist job sites , which took up a huge amount of HR staff time , with a high-speed cloud-based service . <p> The service , known as Broadbean can post a job vacancy to 40 or 50 job sites across Europe with a single click . <p> \" We used to do sporadic advertising . We went to one job board , and it cost us ? 600-900 to post one job . Now we can get a factor of ten cost savings by buying in bulk . The administration cost is a lot lower , \" he said . <h> Video interviews <p> CERN has made further savings by screening shortlisted candidates remotely , through cloud-based video service , Sonru , rather than interviewing each candidate face to face . <p> James Purvis , CERN <p> \" We have carried out 1,500 interviews using Sonru . We can reduce the number of candidates we need to interview in Geneva and have seen at least a 20% saving in recruitment costs , \" said Purvis . <p> The system has allowed CERN to weed out candidates who look good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early stage . <p> It gives recruitment managers the freedom to review the videos when it suits them . \" ' To Sonru ' has now become a verb at CERN , \" said Purvis . <h> Social Media <p> CERN 's HR team is producing a large range of videos for Facebook and YouTube to attract potential recruits . <p> They raise CERN 's profile as an employer and give candidates advice on applying for jobs at the organisation , said Purvis . <p> And the HR team is using Twitter to post job vacancies . This helps to push CERN 's recruitment pages up the rankings in Google , says Purvis . \" We want to make sure we are up at the top , \" he said . <h> Tracking applicants <p> The programme has left CERN with another problem -- how to track the growing number of candidates that are applying for vacancies . <p> \" Because of the success of our advertising and Sonru , we have moved from dealing with 30 or 50 applicants per post to several hundred per post , \" said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system since 2002 , but Purvis is looking at improvements that could made applicant tracking easier . <p> \" Our applicant tracking system is very robust , but our process runs on the assumption that the recruiter needs to review each CV , \" he said . \" We are looking to give rankings to candidates based on their skills and experience , rather than read every CV \" he said . <p> Purvis plans to upgrade the applicant tracking system next year . The main technical challenge will be integrating it with CERN 's Oracle-based HR system . <p> Because CERN is a government organisation , it needs a sophisticated HR system that can deal with issues such as helping staff relocate , and finding schools for workers ' children . <p> \" Technology has allowed us to deliver more with the same resources .

"title": "Hereford and Folkestone closures are bad news for horse racing\n",
"text": "<p> When considering the closures - for the time being , at least - of Hereford and Folkestone racecourses , I need to declare an immediate interest . <p> I actually have no recollection of going to Hereford for the first time , simply because I was so young at the time . But like many families that lived close by , the Lysaghts attended loyally , with a March Saturday and the Whitsun bank holiday fixture especially popular . This was in the days before a short-lived Boxing Day meeting . <p> It is important for the future of jumping that the smaller tracks , other Herefords and Folkestones , survive <p> What I do recall , however , is going with some friends when aged three and a half . The racecard ( which I still possess ) contained the names of such 1960s riding legends as Terry Biddlecombe and Eddie Harty . <p> And , pun entirely intended , I knew the form : the location of the weighing room , the bookies ( though even the most amiable refused us ) and knowing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence . <p> Forty-five-plus years later , the party that has been going on at Hereford since 1771 ( and since 1898 at Folkestone ) is over , after Arena Racing Company ( ARC ) , the owner or leaseholder of 17 tracks in all , made the closure decision . <p> At Hereford , the fixtures have been moved elsewhere , and although the track is technically licensed for 2013 , officials do not anticipate any racing taking place . <p> You will understand , therefore , the deep sense of sadness being felt by this son of Herefordshire ; something similar no doubt applies to regulars at its doomed sister course in Kent . <p> ARC 's bosses insist that neither is viable in its current form , and that they make no money . However , they say that if an extension on the current 17-year lease at Hereford can be sorted - and planning issues at Folkestone likewise resolved - the closures , the first of any longstanding track since Stockton , Teesside , in 1981 , could be reversed . <p> There is , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bath <p> Brighton <p> Chepstow <p> Doncaster <p> Ffos Las <p> Folkestone <p> Fontwell Park <p> Great Yarmouth <p> Hereford <p> Lingfield Park <p> Newcastle <p> Royal Windsor <p> Sedgefield <p> Southwell <p> Uttoxeter <p> Wolverhampton <p> Worcester <p> In large racecourse groups like ARC , just one aspect of the Reuben Brothers ' business empire , the shareholders are king . <p> A large portion of the lucrative revenue from media rights and the income from the bookmakers ' levy does not remain at the tracks where it is generated but is soon off to the holding company 's coffers . <p> There is a suspicion among some that the sport is of secondary importance . <p> In contrast , some of the people running independent courses - Taunton in Somerset is a good example - are less concerned about shareholders and able to plough their cash back into facilities and prize money . <p> It may be naive to think everyone can operate like this , but it is important for the future of jumping that the smaller tracks - other Herefords and Folkestones - survive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vast pyramid , at the top of which stand the bigger fixtures , like Cheltenham and Aintree , that operate as the sport 's shop window . <p> Horses that are to climb to the top need somewhere to start : early sorties in the successful careers of good hurdlers Mrs Muck and Mighty Man took place at Hereford . The demise of racing in Herefordshire and in Kent is not just sad for local racegoers ; it is bad news for the sport as a whole . <p> At the final Hereford meeting , ARC 's Jim Allen said : \" We will keep it as a racecourse , maintaining the fences , hurdles and running rails , cutting and fertilising the racetrack . <p> \" We are happy to talk to anyone because we will do what we can to keep racing .

Kraft 's portfolio also includes coffee brands such as Kenco , Carte Noir and Maxwell House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had a loyal following with Britsh consumers and the empathy has never been higher than today .

Could not subscribe , try again later <p> Survivor recalls Llandow air disaster 60 years ago <p> Wales will this week mark the 60th anniversary of the worst plane crash in the country 's history . On the eve of the anniversary , Julia McWatt spoke to survivors , rescuers and witnesses about their memories of the Llandow air disaster <p> ON the morning of March 12 , 1950 , Dubliners woke to a bright , clear , spring-like morning . <p> Among them that day was a large contingent of Welsh rugby fans , in town to watch their national team battle for the Triple Crown against the Irish . <p> The match itself was a tense affair , clinched with tries from Onllwyn Brace and Brian Cresswell that secured a 10-9 win for the Welsh . <p> As the crowds made their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport for a flight back to Wales . <p> Spirits were high among the Welsh fans , particularly for a group of eight supporters from Llanharan who travelled to virtually every international . <p> Among that party , who played together at the village 's rugby club , was Melville Thomas , who was 25 at the time . <p> \" We stayed in Dublin and we had two coaches to take us to see the game , \" he said . <p> \" We had wanted to look around the city so we got on the second coach which had stayed until everybody was ready to leave . Everyone was in high spirits when Wales won , \" he said . <p> The group nearly missed getting on the first flight to Dublin from Llanharan after their taxi to the aerodrome broke down and they considered driving there and back . But the wheel was fixed and they managed to get on the flight . <p> Mr Thomas would never see his friends again . <p> The plane , an Avro 689 Tudor V which had been used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerodrome at an extremely low height , before the pilot reportedly tried to pull it upwards . The engines stalled and the aircraft came down at the edge of a field beside Park Farm , Sigingstone . <p> The crash , which became known as the Llandow air disaster , killed 75 passengers and five crew members , with only three passengers surviving . <p> At the time , it was the world 's worst aviation tragedy . <p> Mr Thomas , now 85 , is now the only living survivor of the disaster . <p> He has limited memory of the event itself , which left him unconscious for two days . <p> Mr Thomas , who still lives next to Llanharan rugby club with his wife Betty , had gone to the toilet at the time of the crash and had been boxed in by the metal walls . Paramedics found him in the cubicle with serious injuries . <p> He had a fractured jaw , a broken nose , damage to his neck and cuts and bruises all over his body . <p> He was taken to St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months before he was allowed to return home . <p> \" It was the cubicle which saved my life , I 'm sure .

They were fastened down and I was in one of the seats with my mate . The other ones were the kind which fastened up and they all slipped . That 's what I think happened , \" he said . <p> An inquiry held in May 1950 concluded that the loading conditions of the aircraft had been over the limit , as four extra seats had been put in at the back . <p> It was these extra seats , which had been bolted in rather than screwed in , which were the seats which Mr Thomas had been sitting in . <p> A further court case took place at Cardiff Magistrates Court in November 1950 . <p> The airline was fined ? 50 for failing health and safety checks and ? 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight mechanic at St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan , was among the first rescue parties to arrive at the scene . <p> \" I was waiting for my tea when I saw the plane come over , and I thought it was strange as it was so low , \" he recalls . <p> \" It was such a big plane and I could not work out where it would land . We then got a call over the Tannoy system that there had been a crash . \" <p> Mr Robinson , now 78 , went out with other members of the RAF to help at the scene . <p> \" We thought it was just a light aircraft that had crashed , \" he says . <p> \" When we saw it , it was pretty appalling . All the bodies of the passengers were in the middle of the plane as all the seats had slipped . \" <p> Mr Robinson remains convinced that it was these extra seats that caused the crash . <p> \" They had to get a rough idea of the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have tipped the balance towards the back , \" he says . <p> Mr Robinson , who now lives in Hampshire , remembers around seven or eight people being taken from the plane alive , but most of them died in the hospital at St Athan . <p> Two survivors escaped from the plane and ran to a nearby farm , but Mr Robinson says they were reported missing -- meaning that he was forced to enter the wreckage to look for them . <p> \" We had to go into the heart of the place and we saw things which were very unpleasant . <p> \" We also had to clear up all the personal possessions of the passengers , and I still have a plastic whistle from the rugby match that I found . <p> \" I thought it had not had much of an impact on me at the time , as I was just doing what I was trained for , but later on back at the station , I was violently sick . <p> \" And for years later , the smell of burning fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb witnessed the disaster as an eight-year-old boy who lived near RAF St Athan . <p> \" I knew the sounds of aircraft starting up and the noises they made . <p> \" That day I heard different engines so I looked up and I remember the plane flying down the Bristol Channel towards Cardiff , south of St Athan . <p> \" It turned round and came back along the Channel and then turned over to Llantwit Major . <p> \" It then turned again and headed back towards Cardiff , before turning a final time towards Llandow . <p> \" It came down and then I remember the engines reversing , which is unusual , and then it just went silent , there was no crash or explosion , just a lot of black smoke \" . <p> He rushed to tell his father , Frank , a Flight Sergeant at RAF St Athan , who cycled three miles to the site . <p> He was one of the first people to arrive at the scene . <p> \" The thing that 's not known is that the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" I guess the pilot just got lost . <p> \" I have always remembered it , there were not that many passenger aircraft around .

Now is a time for reflection and a reminder that the protection of human lives must always be our first concern . We must never see a repeat of the Kielland disaster . <h> Alexander L. Kielland capsized in the North Sea <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ognedal , personally experienced the sinking of the Alexander L Kielland flotel , albeit from the safety of a secure office on dry land . At the time , the dimensions of the incident were simply so incredible and unreal that the whole population of Norway was in shock . <p> Engineers who worked on safety at the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate in those days promised each other they would do their utmost to prevent anything similar from happening in the future . Thirty years on , it is appropriate that everybody remembers and reflects on the Kielland disaster . <p> Today 's offshore installations unquestionably incorporate substantially higher standards of safety and the working environment than they did 30 years ago and that reflects in part the lessons learnt from the Kielland disaster . It is very unlikely that another accident with the same causes could have similarly disastrous consequences today . <p> The real worry is that the industry may be losing focus . Many of the young people entering the oil and gas business would have scarcely heard of the Alexander L Kielland and must be reminded of previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We must never forget that the protection of human lives must always come first and do our uttermost to prevent anything like the Kielland accident from happening again . <p> The Kielland disasterThe Alexander L. Kielland was a Pentagon-type semi-submersible located in the Ekofisk Field for Phillips Petroleum , acting as a floating hotel for workers from the Edda Platform . Around 1830 hours on 27 March 1980 , one of the main horizontal braces supporting one of the five legs failed due to gale force winds and high seas . The failure of the brace was later attributed to a fracture which had developed around a hole in the structure which a hydrophone , used to aid the positioning of the rig , had been installed . After the failure of the first brace , the remaining five braces attached to the leg failed in quick succession causing the leg to break off . The rig almost immediately listed to one side , partially submerging the main deck and accommodation block . <p> The initial collapse occurred within a minute but the Kielland remained floating for about another 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made to launch lifeboats , with only two of the seven lifeboats launched successfully . Three of the lifeboats were smashed against the rig 's legs as result of the storm winds and waves whilst being lowered , leading to a number of casualties . After around 15 minutes , as water flowed into another two of the rig 's legs , the last anchor wire parted and the rig rolled over completely with only the undersides of its legs visible above the surface . <p> On top of the high winds and waves , the men also faced near freezing waters with little protection .

The social media tool , which did not exist at the time of the last election in 2005 , now has over 75 million users who between them sent four billion tweets in the first quarter of 2010 . <p> It is also home to a vibrant -- and often vitriolic -- political community that is certain to go into overdrive in the run-up to polling day and beyond . <p> But whose side are they on ? <p> To answer this question , Reuters commissioned market research company Crimson Hexagon to conduct a detailed assessment of opinions expressed by the UK public about the political parties on Twitter . <p> Archiving all tweets related to the parties and their leading figures and then analysing them for positive and negative sentiment ( while simultaneously filtering out any tweets which expressed no opinion ) , the research team was able to take the political temperature of British Twitter users . <p> The results make for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the percentage of positive tweets for Labour , Conservatives , Lib Dems and other parties between March 22 and April 5 . The Conservative Party scores slightly better than its rivals ; over the entire period 13 percent of tweets were pro-Tory , compared with 10 percent pro-Labour , 8 percent pro-Lib Dems and 8 percent for other parties . <p> Unfortunately for Tory leader David Cameron , it 's downhill from here . This next graph , showing negative tweets for each party during the same period , shows a big gap between anti-sentiment for the Conservatives and the other parties ( an average of 28 percent anti-Tory , 18 percent anti-Labour , 7 percent anti-Lib Dems and 8 percent for the other parties ) . <p> The final graph shows the net results for each party and confirms that anti-Tory sentiment was constant throughout this period . <p> Edward Schneider , a consultant at Crimson Hexagon , said : \" Twitter reveals the Tories to be the most talked about , as well as the most polarising , party in recent weeks . Over 40 percent of Twitter conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Conservative Party , compared to only 28% for Labour . <p> \" However , much of the gap in volume is comprised of negative tweets -- the Conservative Party has only a 3 percentage point lead on Labour in terms of favourable tweets . <p> \" It 's worth noting that Twitter support for the Liberal Democrats and other parties , particularly UKIP , does not lag far behind , and in aggregate terms it actually surpasses both the leading parties . The possibility of a hung parliament is unquestionably alive , at least online . \" <p> Over the coming weeks we will update this information to provide you with a real-time view of what the UK Twitter community truly thinks about the main political parties . <p> Twitter is great for following certain people or laundry lists at once , but to enable deeper insights and analysis we created a side-by-side comparison site , Politwecal , at http : //www.politwecal.com .

But it threatens to turn into an embarrassing episode for a series of senior British figures . Both David Cameron and Foreign Secretary , William Hague , have said the release was \" a mistake \" . But officials in Washington have confirmed that they want to ask past and present UK ministers to give evidence about their handling of the case -- casting a shadow over former justice secretary Jack Straw and the Scottish Justice Minister , Kenny MacAskill , the man who authorised the release . <p> But , in an attempt to deflect criticism from his own administration , Mr Salmond suggested that the senators look elsewhere . \" It is important to understand that what the American senators want to inquire about is whether there was a deal in the desert with Col Gaddafi , \" Mr Salmond said . \" The best way to answer that would be to call Mr Blair and ask him directly . \" <p> Mr Blair 's name has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four senators who pushed for the hearings . \" Back in 2007 , BP and the Libyan government struck a $900m oil deal that the Prime Minister , Tony Blair , helped to co-ordinate , but the deal ran into roadblocks , \" he told reporters last week . <p> Megrahi served eight years of a life sentence for the Lockerbie bombing , which killed 270 people , most of them American . He was released last year by Scottish ministers on compassionate grounds , following medical advice that he had three months to live . <p> The then prime minister , Gordon Brown , denied giving any assurances to Libya 's leaders that the bomber would be freed in exchange for oil contracts . BP acknowledged in a statement at the time that it \" did bring to the attention of the UK government in late 2007 our concerns about the slow progress in concluding a prisoner-transfer agreement with Libya .

The fact that Megrahi is about to mark a year of freedom has only intensified the resentment felt by many Americans over his release . Now , with BP linked to the controversy , the outrage is sure to continue . <p> The foreign relations committee will move quickly this week to identify witnesses to testify at hearings , set for 29 July , on BP 's alleged involvement in the Megrahi release . No final list was ready this weekend -- nor is it clear that any Britons asked to give evidence will oblige .

"text": "<h> Graphic Novel : Heart of Darkness <p> I 've always had trouble with Marlon Brando 's performance in Apocalypse Now ; his Kurtz is far from Conrad 's bed ridden , emaciated ivory dealer . This depiction offers a more than fitting visual interpretation of Kurtz , with his universe-encompassing stare depicted in a manner that live action will never manage . <p> This is a hyper-reality that the illustrator Catherine Anyango capitalizes on , the paradox that sometimes illustration is the best way to depict real life . The literal animation of inanimate objects is rendered beautifully , the \" carcass \" of an old steam engine being a perfect example . The frequent depiction of events from a bird 's eye view give a sense of two-dimensional progression along a map and the landscapes seen from this perspective often take on the appearance of some great animal 's skin . The pareidolia found in the original work is also a strong feature of the graphic novel , so strong as to reverse itself at times : faces found in scenery turn into scenery found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white , though a sort of sepia black and white , not the boldness of Persepolis . The illustration is done in pencil , though often crossing into inky territory , where bold smudges are reminiscent of cartographical inkblots or violent blood splatter . Intense charcoal portraiture and sketch is used alongside this ; the former being one of the novels most effective illustrative skills . It should n't escape our attention that the narrator , Marlowe , is given Conrad 's own countenance . <p> In written style the graphic novel is just as brief as the book . In place of broad dialogues , individual lines are singled out and placed on a pedestal of dramatic image . Undoubtedly a vast part of Heart of Darkness ' literary beauty is forgone , but this is inevitable in such a densely poetic novel and can be forgiven . The lines that have been chosen remain powerful , particularly alongside highly charged pictures ; in this way , Conrad 's literary beauty is left intact and in charge . ",

"title": "New York Week: A Guide to Brooklyn's DIY Scene\n",
"text": "<p> Until recently , university-aged indie rock fans in New York City have n't had a lot of options . In a city that boasts dozens of clubs and venues , many under the age of 21 have been shut out of shows . <p> The drinking age in America was set nationally at 21 in 1984 . The state of New York leaves it up to the discretion of club owners whether or not they include the underagers , as club owners would have to purchase specific insurance policies to cover the under-21 crowd , and could have their liquor licenses thrown into jeopardy if undercover cops were to bust underage drinkers , they have little incentive to be inclusive . This has been a major motivating factor for the DIY scene that has sprouted in Brooklyn over the last ten years . <p> \" People think that we 're just trying to have the most wild illegal sort of party ever or something , which is often kind of sad because that 's not what we 're going for , \" says Todd Patrick , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2001 . He is perhaps New York 's best known indie promoter , having booked such bands as No Age , the Thermals , and the Fall in spaces ranging from his own venues to Polish night clubs to the high-ceilinged space above an auto body shop . \" Not that having a fun party is n't also good , but that 's not why we do it . We do it because we want the musicians to be able to play in front of young people who are legally barred from seeing them . \" <p> The So So Glos have experienced this conundrum from both sides of the stage . Brothers Ryan and Alex Levine and their step-brother Zach Staggers grew up in Bay Ridge , Brooklyn , and were joined by guitarist Matt Elkin in 2007 . The band found themselves sneaking underage friends through the back doors of Lower East Side clubs . They were additionally frustrated by the system of paying bands based on a tally of who came to see them , and , in Ryan 's words , \" playing shows booked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . \" <p> The band began playing shows in the back rooms and basements of bars . Some of these shows were booked with the help of Joe Ahearn , who now runs the DIY venue Silent Barn as well as overseeing ( with Todd P ) the production of Showpaper , a 10,000 run bi-weekly newspaper listing all-ages shows in the greater New York area that cost less than $25 . <p> While on tour in the US in 2007 , the So So Glos decided they wanted to run their own DIY venue . \" Seeing art spaces , meeting all these great people , we felt we had to reciprocate , \" says Alex . <p> \" What we saw on our first tour in America inspired us to do bigger things here , \" says Matt . Bigger is the operative word : When they had returned from tour , Joe Ahearn was ready to show them what would become the Market Hotel . At 300 capacity , it 's the largest venue of its kind in Brooklyn . <p> Incidentally , Todd P had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , as he was with other potential show spaces , but had not been able to get in touch with the landlords . \" The So So Glos ... called the number and magically got someone to answer the phone , \" he says . \" And so they went and saw it and came to me and said , ' do you want to be involved ? ' and I said , ' of course . ' \" <p> The So So Glos are no longer directly involved in Market Hotel ; in May 2009 , they opened Shea Stadium in conjunction with producer Adam Reisch . The converted warehouse space serves as a live room and recording studio , and Reisch records every live set , allowing bands to come away with a \" Live at Shea Stadium \" tape . <p> The Market Hotel , meanwhile , is currently dark . After a police raid in April 2010 , the space needs to have various improvements made in order to meet various standards and qualify for the necessary permits to reopen . <p> Many of the DIY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces are actually people 's homes , loft spaces and larger apartments that have the furniture shoved out of the way for bands to play . Some are commercial spaces the landlords rent knowing they will be used as \" performance spaces \" and that some of the artists will be bands . That does not necessarily qualify the venue to charge for admission or sell alcohol . It is also an open secret that some of the commercially zoned spaces are lived in , though the landlords are n't amongst those in on the secret . <p> \" Your neighbors and the local police precinct are the biggest things you have to watch out for , \" says Bill Dozer , whose space , the Acheron , opened in May 2010 . \" The cops generally do n't bother you because they have bigger things to worry about , \" he says . \" Keep the face of your business clean . \" The Acheron , Shea Stadium , and Silent Barn are all in commercial or industrial areas ; with residential neighbours few and far between , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Market Hotel , though parallel to an elevated Subway station , is in a high traffic commercial area , with cornershops and bars that are open well into the night . The circumstances encourage a police presence more so than shuttered warehouses . <p> Bill sees how spaces like the Acheron can create something permanent . Recalling shows at the residential McKibbin and Johnson loft complexes in the nebulous area called East Williamsburg , the schedules would have to be sporadic because of the neighbors . With this in mind , he is quick to emphasise the importance of running a DIY venue with the same professionalism as a commercial venue . \" Make sure shows start and end at the same time . Make sure the bathroom is fucking clean , \" he says with a laugh . \" When you 're working at a show the first thing is that you 're at work . \" <p> The future of DIY venues in Brooklyn could be shaped by the progress of the Market Hotel Project , the vehicle for getting the space up to code and securing its non-profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venue in the city to accomplish this -- former punk squat ABC No Rio on the Lower East Side has non-profit status , as does ISSUE Project Room , an art and performance space in Brooklyn that caters to avant garde tastes . Both venues have acquired million-dollar grants from the city . Non-profit status would help protect the Market Hotel against sky-rocketing NYC rent prices , and hopefully create a lasting community space . <p> \" The idea of sustainability is really the issue here , \" says Todd . \" That anyone can use at a low cost , that other promoters and organizers can come in ... it will not be mine then , it will be run by a board , and hopefully served by and serving the community . So trying to create a framework that makes it easier for folks to keep this going after we step out . \" <p> If there is a competition of **28;374;TOOLONG , within the scene there is less competition and more community . In addition to the listings in Showpaper , Todd P offers a comprehensive list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows on his website . Recognising the attention he gets as a promoter , he is also keen to those who were already booking shows when he first moved to New York . Russ Waterhouse , lately of the Philadelphia band Blues Control , and visual artist Kyle Lapidus of the duo Lovid were both booking shows in the early 2000s , as was John Fitzgerald who started the Mighty Robot space ( now Secret Project Robot , and where Todd P 's Monster Island Basement is located ) , who Todd P cites as \" the one who got the idea of these things , of good shows happening in Williamsburg . Previous to that , there were shows happening in Williamsburg , but they were , yeah , whatever . He started doing the great stuff . \" <p> Bill Dozer , who currently plays with Attake , and the So So Glos , has recently completed a US tour with Matt and Kim , have learned first hand what to expect as a band and what to offer touring bands . Bill , for example , uses outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acheron , is very clear with bands about what money is being taken off the door . \" If the bands are happy with the show , it 's us , \" he says . \" If they 're happy or unhappy with the way they 're paid , that 's the promoter . \" <p> Todd P remains adamant that anyone could throw a show , and makes no illusions of the simplicity of the process . \" If people see us setting up , they see how set-up is done .

"lower_text": "<p> until recently , university-aged indie rock fans in new york city have n't had a lot of options . in a city that boasts dozens of clubs and venues , many under the age of 21 have been shut out of shows . <p> the drinking age in america was set nationally at 21 in 1984 . the state of new york leaves it up to the discretion of club owners whether or not they include the underagers , as club owners would have to purchase specific insurance policies to cover the under-21 crowd , and could have their liquor licenses thrown into jeopardy if undercover cops were to bust underage drinkers , they have little incentive to be inclusive . this has been a major motivating factor for the diy scene that has sprouted in brooklyn over the last ten years . <p> \" people think that we 're just trying to have the most wild illegal sort of party ever or something , which is often kind of sad because that 's not what we 're going for , \" says todd patrick , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 2001 . he is perhaps new york 's best known indie promoter , having booked such bands as no age , the thermals , and the fall in spaces ranging from his own venues to polish night clubs to the high-ceilinged space above an auto body shop . \" not that having a fun party is n't also good , but that 's not why we do it . we do it because we want the musicians to be able to play in front of young people who are legally barred from seeing them . \" <p> the so so glos have experienced this conundrum from both sides of the stage . brothers ryan and alex levine and their step-brother zach staggers grew up in bay ridge , brooklyn , and were joined by guitarist matt elkin in 2007 . the band found themselves sneaking underage friends through the back doors of lower east side clubs . they were additionally frustrated by the system of paying bands based on a tally of who came to see them , and , in ryan 's words , \" playing shows booked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . \" <p> the band began playing shows in the back rooms and basements of bars . some of these shows were booked with the help of joe ahearn , who now runs the diy venue silent barn as well as overseeing ( with todd p ) the production of showpaper , a 10,000 run bi-weekly newspaper listing all-ages shows in the greater new york area that cost less than $25 . <p> while on tour in the us in 2007 , the so so glos decided they wanted to run their own diy venue . \" seeing art spaces , meeting all these great people , we felt we had to reciprocate , \" says alex . <p> \" what we saw on our first tour in america inspired us to do bigger things here , \" says matt . bigger is the operative word : when they had returned from tour , joe ahearn was ready to show them what would become the market hotel . at 300 capacity , it 's the largest venue of its kind in brooklyn . <p> incidentally , todd p had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , as he was with other potential show spaces , but had not been able to get in touch with the landlords . \" the so so glos ... called the number and magically got someone to answer the phone , \" he says . \" and so they went and saw it and came to me and said , ' do you want to be involved ? ' and i said , ' of course . ' \" <p> the so so glos are no longer directly involved in market hotel ; in may 2009 , they opened shea stadium in conjunction with producer adam reisch . the converted warehouse space serves as a live room and recording studio , and reisch records every live set , allowing bands to come away with a \" live at shea stadium \" tape . <p> the market hotel , meanwhile , is currently dark . after a police raid in april 2010 , the space needs to have various improvements made in order to meet various standards and qualify for the necessary permits to reopen . <p> many of the diy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces are actually people 's homes , loft spaces and larger apartments that have the furniture shoved out of the way for bands to play . some are commercial spaces the landlords rent knowing they will be used as \" performance spaces \" and that some of the artists will be bands . that does not necessarily qualify the venue to charge for admission or sell alcohol . it is also an open secret that some of the commercially zoned spaces are lived in , though the landlords are n't amongst those in on the secret . <p> \" your neighbors and the local police precinct are the biggest things you have to watch out for , \" says bill dozer , whose space , the acheron , opened in may 2010 . \" the cops generally do n't bother you because they have bigger things to worry about , \" he says . \" keep the face of your business clean . \" the acheron , shea stadium , and silent barn are all in commercial or industrial areas ; with residential neighbours few and far between , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market hotel , though parallel to an elevated subway station , is in a high traffic commercial area , with cornershops and bars that are open well into the night . the circumstances encourage a police presence more so than shuttered warehouses . <p> bill sees how spaces like the acheron can create something permanent . recalling shows at the residential mckibbin and johnson loft complexes in the nebulous area called east williamsburg , the schedules would have to be sporadic because of the neighbors . with this in mind , he is quick to emphasise the importance of running a diy venue with the same professionalism as a commercial venue . \" make sure shows start and end at the same time . make sure the bathroom is fucking clean , \" he says with a laugh . \" when you 're working at a show the first thing is that you 're at work . \" <p> the future of diy venues in brooklyn could be shaped by the progress of the market hotel project , the vehicle for getting the space up to code and securing its non-profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venue in the city to accomplish this -- former punk squat abc no rio on the lower east side has non-profit status , as does issue project room , an art and performance space in brooklyn that caters to avant garde tastes . both venues have acquired million-dollar grants from the city . non-profit status would help protect the market hotel against sky-rocketing nyc rent prices , and hopefully create a lasting community space . <p> \" the idea of sustainability is really the issue here , \" says todd . \" that anyone can use at a low cost , that other promoters and organizers can come in ... it will not be mine then , it will be run by a board , and hopefully served by and serving the community . so trying to create a framework that makes it easier for folks to keep this going after we step out . \" <p> if there is a competition of **28;374;toolong , within the scene there is less competition and more community . in addition to the listings in showpaper , todd p offers a comprehensive list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows on his website . recognising the attention he gets as a promoter , he is also keen to those who were already booking shows when he first moved to new york . russ waterhouse , lately of the philadelphia band blues control , and visual artist kyle lapidus of the duo lovid were both booking shows in the early 2000s , as was john fitzgerald who started the mighty robot space ( now secret project robot , and where todd p 's monster island basement is located ) , who todd p cites as \" the one who got the idea of these things , of good shows happening in williamsburg . previous to that , there were shows happening in williamsburg , but they were , yeah , whatever . he started doing the great stuff . \" <p> bill dozer , who currently plays with attake , and the so so glos , has recently completed a us tour with matt and kim , have learned first hand what to expect as a band and what to offer touring bands . bill , for example , uses outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acheron , is very clear with bands about what money is being taken off the door . \" if the bands are happy with the show , it 's us , \" he says . \" if they 're happy or unhappy with the way they 're paid , that 's the promoter . \" <p> todd p remains adamant that anyone could throw a show , and makes no illusions of the simplicity of the process . \" if people see us setting up , they see how set-up is done . and they realize sort of how unpretentious and uncomplicated it is , \" he says . \" and i do n't mean that our stuff is uncomplicated , i mean that all set-ups are uncomplicated . \" <p> the so so glos maintain that bands should n't be discouraged if they ca n't get a show at the increasingly popular shea stadium . they hope to see more venues in a similar vein . \" the more places there are like this , the more shows , \" is matt 's logical opinion . <p> \" if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , \" is zach 's advice . \" it 'll keep going on , and it should go on . \" "

"text": "<p> Warning that \" the sovereign crisis is not over \" , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the IMF managing director and a likely French presidential candidate , called on the European Union to move responsibility for fiscal discipline and structural reform to a central body that is free from the influences of member states . <p> The proposal from so powerful a figure will dismay Ireland and other peripheral euro-zone nations already fearful of a loss of sovereignty as the price of a bail-out . Ireland is expected to agree a rescue of up to ? 100bn ( ? 85bn ) within days , in the form of a low-cost loan to shore up the banks . <p> The scale of Ireland 's problems was laid bare on Friday by Allied Irish Banks , which revealed that it has lost ? 13bn of customer deposits -- mostly \" institutional and corporate \" -- since the start of the year , 17pc of its entire deposit base . <p> Its reliance on funding from \" monetary authorities \" has risen to ? 27bn from a \" high single-digit \" billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allied now has just ? 11bn of acceptable collateral left to pledge to institutions like the European Central Bank . <p> Allied 's numbers sent a fresh wave of panic through the markets , pushing Irish bond yields higher and erasing some of the euro 's earlier gains . <p> Irish 10-year bond yields rose three basis points to 8.34pc and the euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.3652 . George Papaconstantinou , Greece 's finance minister , added the bleak warning : \" Even if Ireland is helped , it can not prevent the debt crisis from continuing . \" <p> Allied also abandoned plans to sell its UK arm due to the \" challenging market conditions \" and increased its planned capital raising this year from ? 5.4bn to ? 6.6bn . <p> Mr Strauss-Kahn 's call to centralise power in Europe is significant because the IMF will contribute a large portion of the Irish rescue . In a speech in Frankfurt , he said : \" The wheels of co-operation move too slowly .

"lower_text": "<p> warning that \" the sovereign crisis is not over \" , dominique strauss-kahn , the imf managing director and a likely french presidential candidate , called on the european union to move responsibility for fiscal discipline and structural reform to a central body that is free from the influences of member states . <p> the proposal from so powerful a figure will dismay ireland and other peripheral euro-zone nations already fearful of a loss of sovereignty as the price of a bail-out . ireland is expected to agree a rescue of up to ? 100bn ( ? 85bn ) within days , in the form of a low-cost loan to shore up the banks . <p> the scale of ireland 's problems was laid bare on friday by allied irish banks , which revealed that it has lost ? 13bn of customer deposits -- mostly \" institutional and corporate \" -- since the start of the year , 17pc of its entire deposit base . <p> its reliance on funding from \" monetary authorities \" has risen to ? 27bn from a \" high single-digit \" billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied now has just ? 11bn of acceptable collateral left to pledge to institutions like the european central bank . <p> allied 's numbers sent a fresh wave of panic through the markets , pushing irish bond yields higher and erasing some of the euro 's earlier gains . <p> irish 10-year bond yields rose three basis points to 8.34pc and the euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.3652 . george papaconstantinou , greece 's finance minister , added the bleak warning : \" even if ireland is helped , it can not prevent the debt crisis from continuing . \" <p> allied also abandoned plans to sell its uk arm due to the \" challenging market conditions \" and increased its planned capital raising this year from ? 5.4bn to ? 6.6bn . <p> mr strauss-kahn 's call to centralise power in europe is significant because the imf will contribute a large portion of the irish rescue . in a speech in frankfurt , he said : \" the wheels of co-operation move too slowly . the centre must seize the initiative in all areas key to reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economic and social policy . countries must be willing to cede more authority to the centre . <p> referring to the crisis , he said : \" the eurozone area 's institutions were simply not up to the task -- even setting up a temporary solution proved to be a drawn-out process . \" one solution is to shift the main responsibility for enforcement of fiscal discipline and key structural reforms away from the council . this would minimise the risk of narrow national interests interfering with effective implementation of the common rules . \" <p> in proposals that are likely to play into the hands of eurosceptics in the uk and elsewhere , mr strauss-kahn recommended more tax harmonisation and a larger central budget for the euro area . he said that labour market reforms need to be centralised , saying : \" it is time to create a level playing field for european workers , especially in the area of labour taxation , social benefits systems and portability , and employment protection legislation . \" "

"text": "<h> Simon Schama , the new government adviser on history teaching , tells Sameer Rahim why children need a return to chronology <p> Nothing can dampen Simon Schama 's enthusiasm for telling stories -- not even being caught in a south Indian rainstorm . When I meet him at The Week Hay Festival in Kerala , his white , Indian-style shirt is soaked and his greying hair is dripping . But the 65-year-old professor of history and art history at Columbia University can not wait to defend his latest project . <p> When Michael Gove , the Education Secretary , appointed him in October as a government adviser on history teaching in schools , the criticism from some was scathing . Mary Beard , the Cambridge classicist , said Schama was \" not only glitzy , but also cheap \" and his new role was \" an insult to history teachers \" . <p> While many others , not least the millions of people who have enjoyed his television shows and bought his critically-acclaimed books , were no doubt delighted that he would be helping to sort out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather unfortunate label . <p> \" The History Tsar thing is a ridiculous title made up by another newspaper , \" says Schama . <p> \" I do n't want to offend any teachers whose work I respect so much and who labour heroically under very difficult circumstances -- especially in comprehensives . <p> \" If anything I just want to be the echo of things I 've heard from them . \" None the less he wrote ( with typical rhetorical brio ) last week of his worry that unless schoolchildren \" can be won to history , their imagination will be held hostage in the cage of eternal now : the flickering instant that 's gone as soon as it has arrived \" . <p> This is a lesson he has certainly managed to pass on in his own family . Earlier this year Schama 's daughter , Chloe , had her first book published . Wild Romance is a scandalous story of Victorian bigamy . <p> I ask whether he was more nervous when her book came out than when his own collection of essays , Scribble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> \" Yes absolutely . I was afraid people would want to get at me through her , \" he says . \" The press were total gents : they were enthusiastic and judged the book in its own right . \" <p> He adds , with touching pride , that the book has been shortlisted for the Longman-History Today Prize . <p> Schama hopes to spread his family 's love of storytelling to every child in Britain . He claims that the current method of teaching history -- focusing on the same few disconnected eras : the Tudors , the industrial revolution , the First World War -- threatens to cut \" the cord of our national memory \" . Expanding on that position , he says : \" I am strongly of the opinion that chronology is very important . The great arc of time is what children are wired for . \" <p> They love reading JK Rowling and Philip Pullman because \" the conceptual apparatus children have is for the epic \" , he adds . <p> I ask him whether there is a role in schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , author of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . At first Schama seems unsure that students in \" Sunderland or Cardiff \" would take to 18th-century orotund irony . <p> But , being Schama , he starts to convince himself . \" You could take one page , the Life of Mohammed , for example -- a rather over-heroic view of Mohammed , but very interesting . \" He seems decided : \" I could do an afternoon of Gibbon with 12 year-olds \" . I say I have detected a Gibbon-like ambition in his work . He looks a little -- but only a little -- uncomfortable with the comparison . <p> eSDLqPatriots and Liberators Schama 's first book , a history of the Netherlands from 1780 -- 1813 suffered from Gibbonitis . I think it won the odd prize , but looking back on it I ca n't read it : those rolling cadences and overlong sentences are just embarrassing now . \" <p> Here in India the decline and fall of the British Empire is clearly on his mind . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Schama included what he delicately called \" the Indian moment \" . <p> \" We 've got all kinds of things to be ashamed of but we have things to celebrate too , \" he tells me . \" That this story matters seems to be unarguable . Why would kids of Asian background not want to know about the age of empire ? \" <p> Well , I say , might it not be awkward in a multiracial classroom to discuss both the crimes and achievements of the empire ? \" History is admirably dangerous . It is not the soft option , \" he replies robustly . \" Teachers need to be grown up and brave . Sensitivity is fine but it stops at the door of honest narrative . \" <p> Other historians , notably David Starkey , would prefer to stress the benevolence of the British Empire . In a piece published this week questioning Schama 's role as history adviser , Starkey said students should study \" how our liberal constitution based on responsible government was adopted worldwide \" . Just as Schama and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hay Festival , whose global media partner is The Daily Telegraph , interrupts us with news that Aung San Suu Kyi , the Burmese pro-democracy leader , has been released from house arrest . \" Oh it 's fantastic , \" says Schama . \" We should drink her health tonight at dinner . A wonderful , wonderful moment . \" <p> Burma was under British rule from 1824 to 1948 and , save for a brief window of democracy , has been ruled by a military junta since independence . Suu Kyi 's story reminds us that Britain 's past is inextricable from present conflicts . <p> University teaching is not part of Schama 's government remit but he must , I ask , surely have an opinion on the proposed rise in student tuition fees . He answers carefully , perhaps restrained by the thought of his new boss , Mr Gove . <p> \" All I would say about that is I 'm quite glad that the full Browne report -- with no cap on tuition fees whatsoever -- does n't seem to have been adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is young men and women only choosing subjects that will help them pay off their debt . \" History is not usually one of those subjects . <p> The tradition in America , where Schama has taught for 30 years , first at Harvard and then at Columbia , is very different . Along with a culture of self-reliance , there are philanthropic donations and plenty of scholarships for poor students . Schama clearly loves America . At the end of his 2008 book The American Future , he wrote that the nation was in \" strong , young , hardworking hands \" . Now he seems less sure . At an event the next day , the Indian audience was treated to Schama at full throttle . <p> Once an admirer of Obama 's \" staggering composure and relaxed cool \" , he now believes the president 's terrible midterm election results came from his failure to communicate the severity of the financial crisis . \" The problem is no story was told to say how close we were to wipeout , \" he says , wandering from the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's passivity in the face of attacks from the Tea Party campaign frustrates Schama : \" He 's an intellectual aristocrat who needs to talk to the doughnut lovers -- or he 's screwed . \" <p> Back in England , news of the engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton cheered up the man many would claim as our national historian . Yet he had some words of warning for the couple and our expectations of them . <p> \" We ask the Royal Family to do two things which are really difficult to put together . To be a cheer-up panacea for our tough times , an emblem of Britishness , optimism and the community coming together . And we also just want them to be a loving couple . \" <p> Those two narratives , Schama implies , are in danger of clouding and confusing each other . And if anyone knows the value of getting your story straight -- whether it 's reconnecting children with epic history , or showing us how Obama has lost the plot -- it is Schama. ",

"text": "<h> 6 global catastrophes that could kill your gadgets forever <h> Lock up your tech , disaster is on its way <p> Since the Sony Walkman crashed onto the shelves worldwide in 1980 , consumer technology has slowly been taking over our lives . <p> From washing machines to digital watches and from electronic word processors to modern tablet computers , the march of technology has been unstoppable . <p> It now sits at the heart of everything we do , as we manage our schedules with Google Calendar , keep in touch via Facebook and mobile phones and entertain ourselves with games consoles and Netflix . <p> But it could all change in an instant . The ( atrocious ) NBC drama series Revolution explores what the world would be like if all technology were to suddenly stop working . An appalling prospect , but could it actually happen ? Here are six scenarios for the death of tech . <h> 1 . Financial collapse <p> Bubbles always burst in the end , and a catastrophic failure of the global markets would certainly stagnate the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse of this nature is certainly not hard to imagine . Indeed , technology itself has often been blamed for financial crisis in the first place . The late Charles P Kindleberger was just one of the historians to lay the blame for many a crash at the door of technological innovations . <p> The truth is that technology changes the world in ways that are rarely predicted . It brings us back to the well-trodden theory that humans will eventually destroy themselves . But if there 's one looming disaster that could cause the mother of all financial disasters and the end of the connected , technological world as we know it , it 's be the ( hypothetical ) horror story of peak oil ... <p> Tech that might survive:Bitcoin becomes the de facto currency of the new order ! Litecoin rebels plot in secret for global domination . <h> 2 . Peak oil <p> Peak oil refers to the exact point in human history where oil production reaches its absolute peak and then begins to decline until it runs dry completely . The theory goes that when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise as supply diminishes , causing huge and unstoppable price escalations ( sound familiar ? ) , eventually reaching the point where no one can afford oil anymore , bringing the whole industrialised world to a grinding halt . <p> So why is this relevant to technology ? Well because everything we know and rely on in the 21st Century is entirely dependent on an ever increasing supply of oil out of the ground . This is how we 're able to continue printing money every day without inflation taking over , making tangible oil supplies absolutely critical to sustainable economies . But more than that , oil is used in practically every single aspect of human life , including the , conception , design , manufacture and shipping of our gadgets . <p> \" All plastic is oil . Most paints , all pesticides are made from oil . Everything from toothpaste to toothbrushes is made from oil . There are 7 gallons of oil in every tyre . There is nothing anywhere in any combination that will replace the edifice built by fossil fuels . Nothing . \" Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacture process , it 's used to build cars and planes and ships and to fuel the transportation of products around the world . It 's the most important raw material on our planet and when it 's gone , there will be nothing to replace it . In short , without oil , there would be no way for Foxconn to manufacture Apple 's iPhones , and certainly no way to then ship them around the world .

For many of this new breed of vinyl junkies , record shopping is not the instinctive , practical act that it was for their elderly hunter-gatherer forefathers ; it is an ancient skill to be learnt , like stonemasonry or grammar . <p> Like any ancient skill , the raw materials are not as plentiful as they once were , but that makes it an altogether more satisfying pursuit . However , there are strict rules and guidelines that must be observed if you want to be become a committed vinyl enthusiast , as follows . <h> Related Articles <p> With vinyl you ca n't just type a few words into a search box and almost immediately experience the results . Vinyl is not for those seeking instant gratification : it involves a physical transaction , so nine times out of ten you might even have to venture out of the house . This means there 's going to be jeopardy all around you . Perhaps the record you 're looking for wo n't be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , in a number of different places . Given the fact that you are probably looking for an unpopular album ( and not the new One Direction release ) , on a relatively unpopular format , and that the days of record shops on every high street are long gone , you could be pounding the pavement for some time . Vinyl enthusiasts need the patience of a JR Hartley , the eyes of an eagle , and possibly the stamina of an Ironman athlete . Stay strong . Nothing beats the moment when you find what you were looking for . <p> Do your homework <p> Unlike the new new wave of vinyl fans , I started getting into music long before the internet was invented . Back in those days if pop was n't your bag you 'd have to home-school yourself by scouring the music press and obscure fanzines , or examining the sleevenotes of albums to find out who the best producers were . I even used to read stock lists from specialist records shops . You need that kind of dedication with vinyl . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can now find most of your information using zany robotronic tools like \" the web \" . Which is sort of cheating , but let 's not make things harder than they need to be . <p> Always listen to the WHOLE record <p> Digital music has done its level best to murder the long player as a viable artform . Why buy 12 tracks when you can download tracks three and seven only ? After all , they were the catchiest when you previewed the album on iTunes . Records -- real , physical ones - demand that you listen to albums from start to finish . They remind you that most records by artists worth their salt have some sort of narrative structure to them , requiring concentration and an attention span , rather than an itchy fast-forward finger and the brain of an impatient goldfish . With vinyl , even if you wanted to switch between tracks and artists all the time , you ca n't , because it 's such a hassle having to repeatedly change one record for another -- these things were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness for that . <p> Find YOUR record shop <p> Local record shops used to be intimidating places jammed with competitive music nerds trying to out-do one another , and for the most part not much has changed ( except that the shops themselves are fewer and farther between ) . People still argue about great songs , they still ca n't settle the great Phil Spector vs Motown Christmas Album debate , and there will always be a music Nazi stationed behind the counter whose main function is to frighten you into buying \" important \" experimental jazz records . But they 're also rich , entertaining and rewarding places - perfect for any vinyl novice willing to wile away the hours flicking through empty sleeves while listening to obscure sounds . And do n't worry , before long you 'll be a competitive music nerd just like the rest of the clientele . Find a shop to call your own and soon you 'll feel right at home . <p> Embrace the crackles <p> After years of overplaying , you 'll find that some of your favourite records develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by surprise , but you will soon learn to love these small blemishes .

It 's like having your own special version . <p> Make room for your collection <p> Besides the sound quality generally being better than on any other medium , another treat that comes with vinyl is the physicality of it , the lovely pictures , the gatefold sleeves , the amount of space the damn things take up . In a world where possessions have given way to digital files , vinyl records are tangible and tactile . They are mementos of a life well lived and money well spent , and they satisfy the senses .

"text": "<h> Artist Blog Daniel Green of Laish -- The Congested Noisy Cloud <p> Hi ! Pleased to meet you . In case we have n't met before , my name is Daniel and I am the singer , guitarist and songwriter who goes out under the name , Laish ( lie-shh ) . I 've been kicking around in Brighton and now London for a wee while , bandying this rather awkward band name about on posters in large , bold fonts . I 've released a couple of albums , a few music videos , and played a hundred odd gigs , both solo and with a tremendous band . And all of the music I have created , I have just set as a free download on Bandcamp . <p> Why ? <p> Well , here 's the thing . The most recent album , Obituaries , was released in March . There was a huge spike of interest during the release campaign as I did all the things a switched-on , modern musician does for his/her baby . I spent a load of money getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record label to help distribute the album into record shops and online retailers . I invested some serious cash into a press and a radio campaign . I organised release parties in London and Brighton . I organised a UK tour . I arranged for a couple of wonderful music videos to be created . I Tweeted and Facebooked to my heart 's content .... <p> I coordinated this whole military operation because it was my job to do so and because it feels great to do all these things . It is hard labour , but it is a labour of love . It is very satisfying watching all this work lead to something . People were finally listening to my music and enjoying it and the reviewers were writing very positive reviews . And some people were buying the CD and paying for the download . Hurrah ! <p> But a release has a life span . The sales have stopped . Flatlined . I am still yet to recoup the costs I spent on producing and marketing the album . And now the album is old ( where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as people discover the songs from that album they can stream it all for free on Bandcamp . You can stream it all for free on Spotify . You can watch all the videos on Youtube for free . It 's all for free ! Everything is free ! <p> So I set them as free download on Bandcamp four days ago and did a few tweets about it . Here 's a stat . A third of every copy of the Obituaries album that has ever been downloaded from my Bandcamp page happened in the last four days . <p> If people do n't want to pay for it , why fight it ? Will those people invest later on in the Laish fund ? Maybe . It 's a risk . Perhaps they will fall in love with the Obituaries album and come and see my next show . Or perhaps they will be ready to spend ? 8-10 on the next NEW album . <p> I decided that I would rather someone download my music from my own outstretched arm than do it sneakily from a torrent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download and gave me their email address so I can tell them about the next gig and new release than listening to it on Spotify , as an anonymous and passive listener . <p> The reverse option would be to remove my albums from as many free services as possible . Take down all the Youtube videos . Remove it from Spotify . Set the Bandcamp album so that only a couple of tracks are streamable and you must buy it to hear the rest . Well I could do that . But doing so would be to fly in the face of the internet . I would only further encourage the torrenters and I would simply reduce any online presence the name Laish would have . We would be invisible . <p> We live in the internet age . As musicians or content creators we are all simply contributing to a congested and noisy cloud . Increasingly people do n't want the physical product of the cd . They just want the music , silly . So we 're asking people to pay for something essentially invisible that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few teething problems with this arrangement . <p> So instead I scream loudly from my desk : \" Take it , take it all ! \" <p> It would be my honour and pleasure to freely contribute to your iTunes library . Add Laish to a playlist . Find a suitable time to listen to it . It 's definitely not party music , perhaps it 's too intense to listen to when you 're making love . Maybe it 's driving music . You could definitely clean a mean kitchen to it . Why not send one of our videos to that guy on Tinder you want to impress . Or do a Tweet about the varying lengths of my hair on Google images . Come see me at a show and tell me what you think .

"lower_text": "<h> artist blog daniel green of laish -- the congested noisy cloud <p> hi ! pleased to meet you . in case we have n't met before , my name is daniel and i am the singer , guitarist and songwriter who goes out under the name , laish ( lie-shh ) . i 've been kicking around in brighton and now london for a wee while , bandying this rather awkward band name about on posters in large , bold fonts . i 've released a couple of albums , a few music videos , and played a hundred odd gigs , both solo and with a tremendous band . and all of the music i have created , i have just set as a free download on bandcamp . <p> why ? <p> well , here 's the thing . the most recent album , obituaries , was released in march . there was a huge spike of interest during the release campaign as i did all the things a switched-on , modern musician does for his/her baby . i spent a load of money getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record label to help distribute the album into record shops and online retailers . i invested some serious cash into a press and a radio campaign . i organised release parties in london and brighton . i organised a uk tour . i arranged for a couple of wonderful music videos to be created . i tweeted and facebooked to my heart 's content .... <p> i coordinated this whole military operation because it was my job to do so and because it feels great to do all these things . it is hard labour , but it is a labour of love . it is very satisfying watching all this work lead to something . people were finally listening to my music and enjoying it and the reviewers were writing very positive reviews . and some people were buying the cd and paying for the download . hurrah ! <p> but a release has a life span . the sales have stopped . flatlined . i am still yet to recoup the costs i spent on producing and marketing the album . and now the album is old ( where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as people discover the songs from that album they can stream it all for free on bandcamp . you can stream it all for free on spotify . you can watch all the videos on youtube for free . it 's all for free ! everything is free ! <p> so i set them as free download on bandcamp four days ago and did a few tweets about it . here 's a stat . a third of every copy of the obituaries album that has ever been downloaded from my bandcamp page happened in the last four days . <p> if people do n't want to pay for it , why fight it ? will those people invest later on in the laish fund ? maybe . it 's a risk . perhaps they will fall in love with the obituaries album and come and see my next show . or perhaps they will be ready to spend ? 8-10 on the next new album . <p> i decided that i would rather someone download my music from my own outstretched arm than do it sneakily from a torrent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download and gave me their email address so i can tell them about the next gig and new release than listening to it on spotify , as an anonymous and passive listener . <p> the reverse option would be to remove my albums from as many free services as possible . take down all the youtube videos . remove it from spotify . set the bandcamp album so that only a couple of tracks are streamable and you must buy it to hear the rest . well i could do that . but doing so would be to fly in the face of the internet . i would only further encourage the torrenters and i would simply reduce any online presence the name laish would have . we would be invisible . <p> we live in the internet age . as musicians or content creators we are all simply contributing to a congested and noisy cloud . increasingly people do n't want the physical product of the cd . they just want the music , silly . so we 're asking people to pay for something essentially invisible that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few teething problems with this arrangement . <p> so instead i scream loudly from my desk : \" take it , take it all ! \" <p> it would be my honour and pleasure to freely contribute to your itunes library . add laish to a playlist . find a suitable time to listen to it . it 's definitely not party music , perhaps it 's too intense to listen to when you 're making love . maybe it 's driving music . you could definitely clean a mean kitchen to it . why not send one of our videos to that guy on tinder you want to impress . or do a tweet about the varying lengths of my hair on google images . come see me at a show and tell me what you think . buy the cd as a christmas present for that uncle who still has a cd player . <p> lend us a tenner . <p> just do n't ever ask me to play a gig for free . unless you like emails that contain only one line and are 60% swear word .

"title": "A Letter From... Northern Ireland #7\n",
"text": "<h> Popular Festivals <p> This has been yet another exciting month in Northern Ireland ... let 's kick things off with some brand spanking new emerging talent . First off the bat is the offering from former Front Woman of No Mean City , Jilly St John . <p> Jilly returns to her rawking roots with her new venture the aptly named Wyldling . Hot off the press Wyldling is much in its early stages but St John and \" Friends \" which the act consist of have already offered the online world a taste of some pretty promising tunes . The initial stand out track for me is ' Waiting on Water ' which holds one hell of a catchy chorus . The track which holds an unmistakable guitar solo slotted in between the echoing raw vocals of St John , shows just how far the front woman has come from her No Mean City days . <p> It is hard to define which genre exactly Wyldling fits into , but one thing 's for certain NI will be hearing a lot about them for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one EP , Barbara from the very talented Best Boy Grip . The hype surrounding Best Boy Grip is not unjustified , as the first thing that springs to mind when listening to this EP is to put it simply , that it is pure listening pleasure for the ears . Barbara is just pure melodic genius and personally it 's been a long time since I have heard such an inviting EP , from any artist . The EP is filled with beautiful lyrics \" My heart stops beating when I hear you speak \" , which can be somewhat comical at times \" you 're the one that feeds me honey from the hive \" are just infectious from start to finish . Stand out track for myself on this EP has to be the title track Barbara , with its beautiful upbeat and pure fun vibe . This is one artist that I see going from strength to strength . <p> Next up on the scene we have A Plastic Rose who will be releasing their much anticipated new single on March 19th , under the Di @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hell of a start by supporting the legendary NI act , Snow Patrol in London 's O2 arena and Belfast 's Odyssey arena , both of which were sold out shows . Gary Lightbody who sought out the band himself in a local venue , in Belfast was impressed enough to add them to the Snow Patrol tour support . The first single from the album which is rumoured to being released in September 2012 , is none other than ' Build From The Ground Up ' . The track starts with an orchestral feel before going fast into A Plastic Roses own take on alternative rock , which takes me vastly back to the nineties . A band hotly tipped not to be missed , I would recommend keeping an eye out for the rest of these guys singles in the run up to their already much talked about new album . <p> One band that I can not fail to mention that has been buzzing all over Northern Ireland recently is the crazily upbeat , Wonder Villains . The band who hail from Derry-Londonderry are in one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indie , the Wonder Villains could be described as none other than a refreshing change . Popular track is the highly cheerful ' Zola ' with its zesty and infectious catchy fun filled pop feel . A band who are as bubbly in their music as they are on stage , if you like that sort of thing and fancy a change they would get my vote as a band to go check out . <p> That is it in the way of bands and EP 's for now but when it comes to NI , it is most definitely a scene that never sleeps . If your around in the next month are so these are my tips for gigs to go check out . <p> New Noise events will be bringing all of Northern Irelands hottest acts to two venues in Derry-Londonderry , Masons bar and the Nerve Centre . Next up is More than Conquers , Dutch Shultz and Droids on the 30th March , a club night where all the cool kids will be for sure . One gig I am truly excited about though is Radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belfast , with In case of Fire , Before Machines and firm favourites , Like Statues . <p> If like me you ca n't wait until next time for your guide to what to listen to in Northern Ireland , local Belfast Radio station Blast 106 promote what 's new in local music every Wednesday on Through the Wall 7pm to 9pm.

However , none of them saw the capitulation coming and their comments now are in stark contrast with what they were saying a few months ago . <p> Ian BothamDaily Mirror , July : \" I have n't seen anything to remotely make me feel as though I need to change my initial prediction of a double 5-0 . There is simply no department in which I think Australia have got an edge over England ... Unless Darren Lehmann is also Professor Albus Dumbledore in his spare time he can not wave a magic wand and turn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January : \" It has been a weak and feeble effort from a group of players who should understand what the bare minimum requirements are for a Test cricketer ... Some serious questions need to be asked about this set-up and this team . \" <p> Michael Vaughan Daily Telegraph , August : \" This England team can ... set their sights on the world No 1 spot held by South Africa . They are beating a team ranked No 4 in the world ... But this England side have everything in their armoury to be the team of an era . No other England team have managed that . \" Daily Telegraph , January : \" England require a different approach going forward in terms of leadership and management of the group . If Andy Flower stays that is fine , and Alastair Cook deserves the chance to rebuild a team completely demoralised by Australia . \" <p> Mike AtheronThe Times , July : There is the \" biggest differential between the teams since the glory days of Australian cricket ... Sometimes it pays not to look beyond the obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer to an Australian juggernaut that began rolling towards the back end of the first day in Brisbane and did not stop until it had flattened everything and everyone in its path \" . <p> Geoffrey Boycott:Daily Telegraph , July : \" Now that England have got their heads in front in I will be very disappointed and surprised if they do not go forward and play even better ... The Australians can talk a good game but quite honestly I do not see enough quality . \" Daily Telegraph , January : \" The players have been mentally dissected and broken . There was no fight or spirit left in them and they were totally humiliated by an Australian team that is good , but not great ... we should be ashamed and embarrassed to lose so abjectly to this lot . \" <p> David LloydDaily Mail , July : \" I 've been saying 5-0 all along and then 10-0 when we get out there ! I 'm just being Glenn McGrath because I loved him . When he was asked , he never gave the other team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win every game . So this time round I 'm saying England will win all five . \" Daily Mail , January : \" I keep on reading that the England team were truly awful in the 90s . Well , I give you this .

Cook , Carberry , Bell , Pietersen , Ballance and Stokes ? Or Atherton , Butcher , Hussain , Thorpe , Hick and Stewart ? \" <p> Glenn McGrath There was one man who saw the whitewash coming , perennially optimistic Australian fast bowling legend Glenn McGrath . In November , he told the Daily Mail : \" I could n't have more faith in the boys . I think we 'll bounce back and win all the Tests .

"text": "<p> Journalist Piers Morgan was the editor of the Daily Mirror from almost a decade . Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The New Yorke <p> Piers Morgan , the former editor of the Daily Mirror , has been interviewed under caution by specialist detectives from Scotland Yard investigating phone hacking . <p> The Metropolitan Police confirmed it had spoken to a 48-year-old journalist as part of Operation Golding , an off-shoot of Operation Weeting , which probed illegal phone interception at the News of the World and was later widened to include Trinity Mirror newspapers . <p> Mr Morgan confirmed that following a voluntary statement which he had supplied to police last year , Scotland Yard subsequently interviewed him under caution at a south London police station on 6 December . The interview followed a formal request that he attend . The Met confirmed that Mr Morgan had not been arrested . <p> In a statement , Mr Morgan , who is now based in the United States as an interviewer on the CNN news channel , said he was asked by Operation Weeting to attend the interview \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Atlanta-based employer said it had been informed immediately after Mr Morgan had been called by Scotland Yard . Trinity Mirror declined to comment . Mr Morgan edited the Daily Mirror from 1995 until 2004 , when he was dismissed after the newspaper published staged pictures of Iraqi prisoners being abused by British soldiers . <p> Some of Mr Morgan 's former colleagues at Trinity Mirror were arrested in dawn raids last year as part of the phone hacking investigation at the Met . He has always denied any involvement in the illegal practice . <p> The interview under caution of the television star means that , including Mr Morgan , six senior journalists from Mirror titles have now been arrested or formally interviewed in connection with the police 's phone hacking investigation . <p> Tina Weaver , the former Sunday Mirror editor , the paper 's former deputy editor Mark Thomas , the People editor James Scott and his deputy , Nick Buckley , were arrested in March last year .

"title": "Intel pulls-in launch of Core i7 Extreme 'Haswell-E' 5000 to Q2\n",
"text": "<p> Intel Corp . has decided to speed up introduction of its next-generation microprocessors and platforms designed for enthusiasts who demand maximum performance . The new Core i7 Extreme \" Haswell-E \" chips along with Intel X99-based mainboards will be introduced at Computex Taipei 2014 in early June , several months before planned originally , according to sources with knowledge of Intel 's plans . <p> Intel 's \" Haswell-E \" central processing unit will be Intel 's first desktop processor to feature up to eight cores based on the Haswell micro-architecture with Hyper-Threading technology . The new chips will integrate 20MB of L3 cache , quad-channel DDR4 memory controller ( 2133MHz maximum clock-speed , up to one DIMM per channel ) , Turbo Boost 2 technology as well as 40 integrated PCI Express 3.0 lanes . The processor is made using 22nm process technology . <p> The new Core i7 \" Haswell-E \" 5000-series central processing units will be compatible with Intel X99 chipset as well as LGA2011-3 socket . The platform will be tailored for enthusiasts , so it will support very flexible tuning and overclocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x8 mode ( four graphics cards and one enthusiast-class solid-state drive in PCIe card form-factor ) , ten Serial ATA-6Gb/s ports , up to six USB 3.0 ports ( 14 USB ports in total ) , various Intel technologies like Rapid Storage , Rapid Recover and so on . <p> Previously it was believed that Intel will introduce the Core i7 \" Haswell-E \" 5000-series CPUs in the third quarter of 2014 , in August or September . However , it looks like the company decided to speed up the things quite a bit : the new high-end desktop ( HEDT ) platform from Intel will be unveiled at Computex Taipei 2013 trade-show and will reach the market shortly after that . <p> The launch of the Core i7 \" Haswell-E \" microprocessor and Intel X99 \" Wellsburg \" core-logic will have a major influence on the market of PC hardware . In particular , makers of motherboards will introduce all-new mainboards based on the latest chipset and feature a bunch of innovations , such as new overclocking and tuning capabilities , Thunderbolt 2.0 , 802.11ac Wi-Fi , advanced integrated audio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roll-out their DDR4 memory sticks earlier than expected . Developers of cooling systems will also likely launch their new products in mid-2014 . Finally , boutique PC makers will also have to unveil new systems featuring the new HEDT platform . Intel did not comment on the news-story . <p> KitGuru Says : Given that the market of PCs remain to be slow , it is surprising to see Intel pulling-in HEDT introduction by a quarter . While the new flagship Core i7-5960X \" Haswell-E \" microprocessor will be rather unique , it will aimed at only a fraction of the market and will hardly bring a lot of revenue to the chip giant . Perhaps , Intel is shifting its attitude towards desktops in general ? <p> Intel pulls-in launch of Core i7 Extreme ' Haswell-E ' 5000 to Q2 , 4.9 out of 5 based on 18 ratings <p> They certainly needed to move this up . Ivy Bridge-E was a massive disappointment -- 2012 's CPU technology coupled to 2011 's chipset -- and all for a premium price tag . What on Earth was Intel thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hand-me-downs from the high-end desktop market . <p> At this point , I 'm not even sure that waiting for an expensive Haswell-E system was even a good idea . Sure eight cores are impressive but what 's the cost ? And only a few types of applications will benefit -- anything an 8-core processor does noticably better will still be a waiting game for the user , less waiting , but still waiting . An now , many of those applications are starting to be implemented on the GPU with even better results . <p> VA:F 1.9.221171 <p> Rating : +1 ( from 1 vote ) <p> http : //www.tuskembedded.com AaronK <p> 8 cores is impressive but curious to see how the high-end race plays . Working on the embedded side of things I 've noticed a slow down in the race for the top with much more of the emphasis being placed on low-power , size and weight . For embedded applications that require high-end processing like Eric states above , we 're starting to see these implemented on the GPU . <p> VA:F 1.9.221171 <p> Rating : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for God 's sake release it already . I have been waiting to upgrade my X58 and just trying to find a reason , and here is it . And do n't be too greedy , that 's the big part : / <p> Well when it comes out I 'll be upgrading my Main / Server machine from i7-2600K with 16GB DDR3 to i7-5960X Expensive MB and 32GB of 2133MHz DDR4 when it 's out .

"text": "<p> Has there ever been a band less likely to be wildly popular than Rodrigo y Gabriela , who are about to play two nights at the Albert Hall and have a London arena date in the offing ? The hit parade is not exactly littered with Mexican instrumental acoustic duos who delight in energetically plucked tributes to historical figures including Fyodor Dostoyevsky , Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen and Eleanor of Acquitane . But then , who knows what direction the next Justin Bieber album will take ? <p> This is specialist stuff , surely , so what are the pair doing so right ? \" It is surprising , \" admits Rodrigo Sanchez , 40 , who is now considered such a major figure in Mexican culture that he and Gabriela Quintero played a White House concert at a meeting between Barack Obama and the last Mexican President , Felipe Calder ? n . Obama told them he had their music on his iPod ; Calder ? n did n't know who they were . \" It 's a different proposal but people were ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> \" I had a very clear idea in my head : I wo n't be something that I 'm not , \" adds Quintero , also 40 , in a singsong voice that leaves no doubt that English is not her first language . \" I ca n't write a friendly radio song . That requires a certain talent . We are not gon na try to be something else -- we are this . \" <p> Theirs would certainly be a tough blueprint for copycats to follow . Having begun their music career in the early Nineties in a heavy metal band , Tierra Acida ( \" Acid Land \" ) , in Mexico City , they moved to Dublin at the start of the last decade to busk as a duo .

"title": "Dido Belle: Britain's first black aristocrat\n",
"text": "<h> Dido Elizabeth Belle , the illegitimate , mixed race daughter of an 18th-century naval captain and subject of a new film , was a Lady like no other , discovers Nisha Lilia Diu <p> The amazing thing about Dido Elizabeth Belle is not that she was mixed-race . Who knows how many white men 's children were born to black slave women in the 18th century ? It 's not even that her father was a wealthy English aristocrat -- there were plenty of titled captains tearing around the Caribbean at that time , capturing French and Dutch schooners during the Seven Years ' War and making off with their sugar , coffee and other ( often human ) cargo . The extraordinary thing about Dido Belle is that her father , a 24-year-old Navy officer called John Lindsay , took her home to England and asked his extended family to raise her . And they did . They did it in some style , too . <p> Belle grew up in Kenwood House in north London . It was the palatial weekend retreat of Lindsay 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscaped gardens with a view of St Paul 's Cathedral six miles away . Mansfield was Lord Chief Justice , and he made a number of landmark rulings on slavery that were among Britain 's first steps towards abolition . Did Belle 's presence in his home have anything to do with it ? Plenty of his contemporaries thought so , and they did n't admire him for it . <p> \" Dido was very , very privileged , \" says William Murray , a descendant of the earl and the son of the heir apparent . \" She was in the top 5 per cent , perhaps the top 1 per cent , in terms of how she lived , her allowance , her dress , her education . \" But Belle 's position was far from clear-cut . <p> At Kenwood , says Murray , \" she was treated like the rest of the family -- when it was just the family . Where it got awkward is when they had guests in , \" he says . The black , illegitimate daughter of a nobleman occupied a peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving classes but too different to be wholly welcome in high society . When the Mansfields were entertaining , Belle did n't eat with their guests . <p> All of this makes Belle , the forthcoming film about Dido 's life from the Bafta-winning director Amma Asante , one of the most unusual costume dramas to hit the big screen . The fabulous gowns , eligible young men and barely suppressed class anxieties of London 's social \" season \" are all present and correct . But other , rarely registered aspects of Jane Austen 's England are at the centre of the frame : the uncomfortable knowledge of where the fragrant leaves and sculpted sugar loaves at the ladies ' tea parties have come from ; and , in Belle ( played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw , who was Ophelia opposite Jude Law 's Hamlet at the Donmar Warehouse in 2009 ) , the evidence of what their men got up to when they were far away at sea or on the plantations . <h> Related Articles <p> We tend to think of mixed-race children as a modern phenomenon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman times . There were around 10,000 black people in the city , and many more of mixed parentage by the time Belle was born in 1761 . Lindsay seems to have met Belle 's mother , a slave named Maria , on a captured ship in the West Indies . He was a young bachelor , but already much-feted by the newspapers back home for his exploits . <p> Their story is recounted in the diaries of Thomas Hutchinson , a former governor of Massachusetts who attended a dinner party at Kenwood in August 1779 . He met Belle during his visit , who was about 18 at the time . \" A Black came in after dinner and sat with the ladies , \" he writes , \" and after coffee , walked with the company in the gardens , one of the young ladies having her arm within the other . She had a very high cap and her wool was much frizzled in her neck , but not enough to answer the large curls now in fashion . She is neither handsome nor genteel -- pert enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continues , \" but My Lord mentioned it again . Sir John Lindsay having taken her mother prisoner in a Spanish vessel , brought her to England where she was delivered of this girl , and which was taken care of by Lord M. , and has been educated by his family . He calls her Dido , which I suppose is all the name she has . <p> \" He knows he has been reproached for showing fondness for her , \" Hutchinson observes , going on to recall one of Mansfield 's cases . \" A few years ago there was a cause before his Lordship brought by a Black for recovery of his liberty . A Jamaica planter , being asked what judgment his Lordship would give answered ' No doubt ... he will be set free , for Lord Mansfield keeps a Black in his house which governs him and the whole family . ' \" <p> The case was that of James Somerset . A slave who had been brought to England , Somerset escaped , was caught and then forced onto a ship bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued he could do with him as he pleased . But witnesses were shocked by Somerset 's violent capture and commentators horrified that a man 's freedom could be denied on English soil . Mansfield ( played in the film by Tom Wilkinson ) set him free , judging that colony slave laws were not binding in England . \" The state of slavery is so odious that nothing can be suffered to support it , \" he said . <p> Lord Mansfield is played by Tom Wilkinson <p> Dido Belle was n't the only child in the Mansfields ' care . They were also bringing up Elizabeth Murray , the daughter of their nephew Lord Stormont , whose wife had died when Elizabeth was six . The two girls appear in a double portrait that once hung at Kenwood and is now at Scone Palace , Lord Mansfield 's ancestral home in Scotland . It was this portrait that piqued the curiosity of Misan Sagay , Belle 's scriptwriter , and started the decade-long process of getting the film made . \" I was amazed to see this black girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the painting was later shown to Amma Asante she had a similar reaction . \" For centuries , black people were basically accessories in paintings , there to express the status of the white people , \" says Asante . \" We were never looking out at the painter but up in awe at the white protagonist . I knew this was something very different . \" Esther Chadwick , a member of the History of Art department at Yale University , agrees . \" What 's remarkable is that Dido is painted at the same height as Elizabeth Murray , and Elizabeth Murray is shown reaching out to her . But what 's most unusual is her direct gaze . \" <p> Kenwood 's accounts show Belle was on an almost-equal footing with Elizabeth . She had a four-poster bed draped in chintz , mahogany furniture in her rooms and costly remedies , purchased when she was ill . She received an allowance of ? 30 a year -- twice the annual salary of the first coachman , but far less than Elizabeth 's ? 100 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seems to have enjoyed a close relationship with her adoptive guardian . Hutchinson recollects that \" she was called upon by my Lord every minute for this thing and that , and shewed the greatest attention to everything he said \" . Mansfield sometimes dictated letters to Belle ( who had beautiful handwriting ) so it 's entirely possible she would have been aware of his cases . One of these was the Zong insurance claim , which forms the centrepiece of the film . <p> In 1781 , a slave ship bound for Jamaica threw 132 slaves overboard . The ship 's owners claimed the vessel had run out of water and the crew had to sacrifice some slaves to save the 300 others on board . Now , they wanted their insurers to pay up for the lost \" cargo \" . The insurance company rejected the claim and it found its way to Lord Mansfield . <p> \" It is a very shocking case , \" he wrote . It appalled English society . The legal argument hinged on whether the slaves had been killed out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become diseased during the journey - and therefore worthless - and had been murdered for the insurance payout . In the end , the owners could n't prove necessity and dropped the claim amid a storm of negative publicity . In the film , Belle experiences a political awakening during the trial and becomes involved in the fight against the ship 's owners . Whether or not this happened , how must she have felt -- and how must Mansfield have felt -- knowing that her own mother had been a slave and that she , too , could easily have met the same fate ? <p> The portrait of Dido Belle and Lady Elizabeth Murray is on show at Scone Palace , Scotland <p> For a long time , the double portrait at Scone Palace was labelled with only one name : \" the Lady Elizabeth Murray \" . As William Murray explains , \" It was only when my grandmother was taking some tourists around Scone in the early Nineties that one of them who had heard of Dido questioned who was in this portrait . \" The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stringfield , an archaeologist at the University of West Florida , was simultaneously digging the site of the house of one Maria Belle . Her work has only just become known to the Murray family and to British researchers . Stringfield found , among other things , a document , signed by Sir John Lindsay , deeding a lot in Pensacola , Florida , to Maria in 1772 . \" It was such an unusual situation , \" she tells me . \" You would not normally have men conveying property to an ex-slave . \" <p> In 1764 , when Dido was three , Lindsay was sent to Pensacola to test naval equipment . Maria Belle probably accompanied him and this is when Dido most likely passed into the Mansfields ' care . \" It was not unusual for men in frontier settings to have women with them that were not their wives , \" says Stringfield . <p> Once in Florida , Lindsay took his pick of land that had been granted to the British Navy . \" The British named the streets after men of importance and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maria Belle 's former house is on the corner of Lindsay and Mansfield streets . Lindsay and Maria returned to London in subsequent years and their relationship continued well into Lindsay 's 1768 marriage to Mary Milner , an MP 's daughter . But it appears to have ended in 1774 , when Maria returned to Pensacola alone . <p> In the deed for the house , Lindsay guaranteed Maria her freedom , and , from Stringfield 's excavations of the site , it looks like he set her up well . Stringfield has found china tea pots and cups , \" a beautiful decanter top \" and pieces of delicate wine glass . \" It was certainly a genteel life , \" she says . <p> Frontier society was relaxed , says Stringfield , and Maria \" probably had women friends in a similar situation to herself here . \" Life at Kenwood could n't have been more different . The Mansfields would have been keenly aware of the furore Dido 's presence in their home caused . In Belle they 're less than delighted when Lindsay turns up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" says an astonished Lady Mansfield ( played by Emily Watson ) . \" She is my blood , \" he replies . <p> \" So why did the first Earl take her on ? \" asks William Murray . \" I think it 's because of his own experience of being an outsider . \" Mansfield grew up in Scotland , the fourth son of the Viscount of Stormont . It was a noble but impoverished line and Mansfield was dispatched to London aged 12 to make his own way . <p> Lord Mansfield died in 1793 , aged 87 , and Belle married five months later . He left Belle an inheritance and an annuity of ? 100 for life . In his will he wrote , \" I assert to Dido her freedom . \" Mansfield 's sister ( played by Penelope Wilton in the film ) also left her money as did Sir John Lindsay . He had no children with his wife but his will mentions a second illegitimate child , John . Maria Belle 's son ? Who knows . <p> Little is known about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- a law student in \" Belle \" but a steward in real life , and the son of the local Reverend in Hampstead . According to Murray , they had known each other , at least by sight , for many years . They moved to what is now Ebury Street in Belgravia and had three children , one of whom joined the East India Company . Belle died of natural causes aged 41 and was buried in the St George 's , Hanover Square , overspill burial ground on Bayswater Road . That was cleared to make way for the redevelopment of the Bayswater area in the Seventies . Nobody 's quite sure where she is now . <p> ' Belle ' is released on June 13 .

"text": "<p> Economic analysis can help policymakers gauge how much action it 's worth taking to tackle future climate change . But some economic models have been criticised for failing to account for the findings of the latest climate science -- resulting , critics say , in significant blind spots . <p> Prominent climate economist , Lord Stern , is one of those critics . He 's previously warned that models \" grossly underestimate \" the risks of climate change , and consequently the cost of failing to act . <p> In a new paper due to be published in The Economic Journal and released by LSE today , Stern and co-author Dr Simon Dietz try to redress the balance . They suggest informing models with the latest research strengthens the case for stringent action to tackle climate change . <p> Estimating costs <p> There are a number of models that try to work out how much economic damage climate change will cause in the future , and how much we should pay now to avoid that . <p> But the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPCC uses multiple ' integrated assessment models ' ( IAMs ) to estimate the future cost of climate change . The models estimate changes in temperature and economic conditions based on future emissions . They then calculate how much additional damage is caused by emitting an extra tonne of carbon dioxide today . <p> That cost is known as the social cost of carbon and is expressed in dollars per tonne of carbon dioxide -- a carbon price , effectively . <p> But the information you get out of models in only as good as the information you put in . Professor Chris Field , co-chair of one of the groups that wrote the IPCC report , has previously said the numbers produced by economic models are \" old fashioned \" when you consider \" the modern science \" . <p> What does that mean ? It implies that economic models do n't capture all the potential impacts of climate change . That means they produce low social cost of carbon estimates , and underestimate the risk of failing to take action to tackle climate change . <p> Updating models <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate insights from recent climate science into one prominent model -- the dynamic integrated climate-economy ( DICE ) model developed by Yale Professor Bill Nordhaus . The thinking goes that by updating what they describe as the models \" unrealistic \" assumptions , the results should become more useful . <p> For example , recent research suggests climate change could seriously damage some countries ' infrastructure or cause certain assets ( such as coastal power stations ) to be abandoned . That could have a big impact on economic productivity , and so Stern and Dietz include this in the model . <p> They also adjust the model 's climate sensitivity input -- the impact of doubling the concentration of greenhouse gases on global temperatures . The standard DICE model only looks at the economic impact of around three degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels . Stern and Dietz make it consider a range from 1.5 to six degrees . <p> Finally , they adjust the temperature threshold at which the model assumes large economic losses occur . The standard DICE model suggests an 18 degree rise in global average temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 50 per cent . But such warming would likely render the Earth uninhabitable for most species , including humans . The tweaked model allows such damage to occur at much lower levels of warming , to try and better reflect the likely real world impact of climate change . <p> The result of the updates -- perhaps unsurprisingly -- is that the reformed DICE model implies taking much stronger action than previously . The updated model finds that if policymakers are going to avoid warming of more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels , they should try to implement a carbon price of $32 to $103 today -- either through a carbon market or a tax . The price should rise to $82 to $260 in 2035 depending on how great the damage from climate change is expected to be . <p> Useful indication <p> The carbon prices need to be taken with a pinch of salt , however . It 's uncertain how much emissions could reduce as a result of implementing a stringent carbon price . That 's why most models -- including DICE -- give a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated to be . <p> Nonetheless , it 's notable is how the results differ to the model 's previous recommendation and current carbon prices . Even in a best case scenario , the updated model 's carbon price is considerably more than the $12 the standard model recommends . It 's also much more than current carbon prices . The EU 's carbon market currently has a price of around ? ? ? 6 ( $8 ) , and two US markets have prices of $2 to $15 . <p> So even if the updated price range does n't translate into a hard and fast policy recommendation , the discrepancy with current prices will support the argument that policymakers are n't doing enough to curb emissions .

"title": "Save the tiger: Learning to live with dangerous neighbours\n",
"text": "<h> Save the tiger : Learning to live with dangerous neighbours <p> Another person is lost to the Royal Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans mangrove forests , straddling India and Bangladesh , almost every month . It is the only region in the world where humans are routinely killed by wild cats . <p> \" Two more men were killed last month -- one on the 11th of July and the other on the 26th . In both cases , they went very close to the jungle to fish and a tiger attacked and killed them , \" says Anil Mistry , 48 , a resident of the village of Bali , in the Indian portion of the Sundarbans . \" It 's not uncommon for people to be killed on the river but more often it happens when they venture deep into the forest to collect firewood , crabs or honey . \" <p> Joseph Vattakaven , of WWF-India , says : \" The Sundarbans is a unique habitat that 's very harsh for tigers and people . These conditions leave the tigers very little prey -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else in the world they prey on human beings . \" <p> Nobody knows how many people have died in the hundreds of villages that lie scattered across the Sundarbans , a maze of swamp , islands and mangrove forests described by Amitav Ghosh , in his novel The Hungry Tide , as \" the trailing threads of India 's fabric , the ragged fringe of her sari \" . <p> Official estimates are sketchy and are generally thought to greatly underestimate the reality because so many of those killed simply go missing . Often the victims are there illegally and relatives fear a fine or the loss of their fishing permit . <p> An unsuccessful scheme to scare off the animals with masks <p> In recent years , tigers and humans have been increasingly thrown together , as climate change combines with years of forest subsistence to put resources under increasing pressure . Fish catches are declining , rivers are silting up , cyclones are becoming more frequent and intense , while rising sea levels result in less fresh water , more floods and faster rates of erosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundarbans are more aggressive than elsewhere because the water in this coastal area is more salty , putting them in a state of discomfort -- but most experts believe this to be a myth . <p> Meanwhile , dwindling resources are forcing communities to go deeper into the \" core \" of the forests to collect honey , fish , shrimps , crabs and wood for their boats and homes . This makes them more vulnerable to tiger attacks , while the tigers are forced to come out of the forest because they are finding less prey . <p> Belinda Wright , a tiger conservationist and founder of the Wildlife Protection Society of India , who also lives in Bali village , says : \" You ca n't walk through the forest . You have to crawl -- human beings become four-legged animals and so the tigers treat you like one of their prey . Over the years people have become completely dependent on the mangrove . This is one of the most impoverished areas in India ; there are no roads , no electricity , and only minimal health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat humans , Mr Vattakaven says , and because they are so deep in the forest no one can see them and the tides take away the remains . <p> \" The tigers have had a massive impact on villagers ' lives . Just to know that after darkness you could get killed -- that changes the mindscape , \" he adds . \" It 's always there in the background . Whenever someone goes to fish or collect honey they stage an elaborate farewell because it might be their last trip . People pray for their safety . <p> \" Everyone knows someone who has been killed by a tiger -- every village has lost at least one person .

"lower_text": "<h> save the tiger : learning to live with dangerous neighbours <p> another person is lost to the royal bengal tigers of the sundarbans mangrove forests , straddling india and bangladesh , almost every month . it is the only region in the world where humans are routinely killed by wild cats . <p> \" two more men were killed last month -- one on the 11th of july and the other on the 26th . in both cases , they went very close to the jungle to fish and a tiger attacked and killed them , \" says anil mistry , 48 , a resident of the village of bali , in the indian portion of the sundarbans . \" it 's not uncommon for people to be killed on the river but more often it happens when they venture deep into the forest to collect firewood , crabs or honey . \" <p> joseph vattakaven , of wwf-india , says : \" the sundarbans is a unique habitat that 's very harsh for tigers and people . these conditions leave the tigers very little prey -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else in the world they prey on human beings . \" <p> nobody knows how many people have died in the hundreds of villages that lie scattered across the sundarbans , a maze of swamp , islands and mangrove forests described by amitav ghosh , in his novel the hungry tide , as \" the trailing threads of india 's fabric , the ragged fringe of her sari \" . <p> official estimates are sketchy and are generally thought to greatly underestimate the reality because so many of those killed simply go missing . often the victims are there illegally and relatives fear a fine or the loss of their fishing permit . <p> an unsuccessful scheme to scare off the animals with masks <p> in recent years , tigers and humans have been increasingly thrown together , as climate change combines with years of forest subsistence to put resources under increasing pressure . fish catches are declining , rivers are silting up , cyclones are becoming more frequent and intense , while rising sea levels result in less fresh water , more floods and faster rates of erosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundarbans are more aggressive than elsewhere because the water in this coastal area is more salty , putting them in a state of discomfort -- but most experts believe this to be a myth . <p> meanwhile , dwindling resources are forcing communities to go deeper into the \" core \" of the forests to collect honey , fish , shrimps , crabs and wood for their boats and homes . this makes them more vulnerable to tiger attacks , while the tigers are forced to come out of the forest because they are finding less prey . <p> belinda wright , a tiger conservationist and founder of the wildlife protection society of india , who also lives in bali village , says : \" you ca n't walk through the forest . you have to crawl -- human beings become four-legged animals and so the tigers treat you like one of their prey . over the years people have become completely dependent on the mangrove . this is one of the most impoverished areas in india ; there are no roads , no electricity , and only minimal health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat humans , mr vattakaven says , and because they are so deep in the forest no one can see them and the tides take away the remains . <p> \" the tigers have had a massive impact on villagers ' lives . just to know that after darkness you could get killed -- that changes the mindscape , \" he adds . \" it 's always there in the background . whenever someone goes to fish or collect honey they stage an elaborate farewell because it might be their last trip . people pray for their safety . <p> \" everyone knows someone who has been killed by a tiger -- every village has lost at least one person . and on top of the deaths there are many that have been marked , bitten ,

"text": "<h> Tom Gallagher spent 32 years teaching politics and casting doubt on seductive cure-alls from European integration to Scottish Nationalism . He is professor emeritus of Bradford University and has published eleven books on European politics . <h> Even as a Catholic , I support the Orange Order 's march in defence of the Union <p> As unsettling polls torment pro-Union citizens , the Orange Order is finalising plans for a march and rally in central Edinburgh this Saturday . This body , long an expression of working-class solidarity with the Union and the Protestant values felt to underpin it , is expected to easily mobilise 10,000 people . <p> Jim Murphy himself is unlikely to be pleased at being lumped together with Orange Scots . When the march was announced he branded the Order as \" unsavoury \" and its initiative unhelpful . He is on a campaign tour which he has dubbed \" 100 towns in 100 days \" , and in Musselburgh on Monday I heard him talk about his own family 's roots in Donegal , Ireland and the far from smooth reception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their way in Scotland . <p> As a practising Roman Catholic mindful of how Protestant fears and suspicion slowed the progress of Catholics who arrived in Scotland from Ireland to toil in the mines and build much of the country 's infrastructure , I share some of Jim Murphy 's reserve . <p> But I am still prepared to emit two cheers for the Orange Order , because of what I know of the recent history of Scotland . It is one of the puzzles of the deadly Ulster conflict that it had so little impact on its closest neighbour . In some of the most populous areas of Scotland , the communal tensions which wreaked such prolonged havoc in Ulster were faithfully duplicated . <p> One important explanation is the role played by Orange officials in defying hotheads who wished to smuggle arms to Ulster and even open up a new front in Scotland . It would have been easy to court cheap popularity by playing along with the militants . But during very tense times in the Seventies , the leadership kept them at bay .

"text": "<p> Nice guys finish last , so the saying goes . There is one man , though , whose recent chart success seems to challenge that maxim . Official figures show that Ed Sheeran , who has persisted with his scruffy image and simple songwriting , was the biggest-selling artist of 2014 with his second album , X. He is Britain 's biggest export since Downton Abbey . <p> Sheeran , already the most searched-for male celebrity on Google , may well see his career scale further heights in 2015 , with two Grammy nominations and three nights at Wembley Stadium in July -- two of which are sold out . Performing with only a backing band , loop pedal and an acoustic guitar , he is about to pull off the biggest busk of all time . <p> So how did Sheeran , a relatively normal bloke , making relatively normal music , manage to become Britain 's biggest-selling artist ? <p> Niceness alone , of course , does n't account for his blockbuster success with album X ; it sold 1.7m copies in 2014 in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark , and has had over 430m streams worldwide since its release in June -- more than any other artist globally . Perhaps it is more thanks to Sheeran 's skills in balancing his guise as the bastion of shabby student authenticity with the role of mercurial businessman -- not to mention a fierce sense of underdog ambition . <p> Ed Sheeran poses with singers Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande and Victoria 's Secret models at a London fashion show in December . Photograph : Karwai Tang/WireImage <p> A bit of luck helps , too . The initial spark for Sheeran 's stratospheric success can be traced back to two chance events . The first occurred during an impromptu LA trip in 2010 , which led to a friendship with the actor and musician Jamie Foxx . Foxx saw Sheeran play and ended up providing him with exposure in the US on his radio show , The Foxxhole . That same year , Sheeran 's music was noticed by the web mogul Jamal Edwards , whose online channel SB.TV has shone a light on the wealth of talent emerging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborating with established grime artists including Wiley , JME and Sway , while he simultaneously worked the grind of indie venues in London , performing 300 shows in 2010 alone . <p> With opportunities opening in both the US and UK , Sheeran was able to establish fans on both sides of the Atlantic -- an accomplishment many musicians are unable to crack throughout the duration of their career . <p> George Ergatoudis , head of music for Radio 1 and 1Xtra , believes Sheeran 's ability to straddle a multitude of modern genres makes him stand out . \" He switches between folk music and black music in a unique way ... no one else channels Eminem and Damien Rice simultaneously like he can , \" he says . <p> Such careful cultural curation appeals to a range of ages , genres and genders , and allows Sheeran to be playlisted on Radio 1 , Radio 2 and BBC 1Xtra . The latter channel named him the most powerful artist on its annual Power List -- a choice that triggered controversy , given 1Xtra 's description as the \" black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indie crowd and pop audiences -- the singer has toured with Taylor Swift -- Sheeran 's honeyed vocals and dalliance with rap styles has also helped increase his trajectory in the US , where hip hop and R&amp;B is a far more lucrative business than in Britain . This year he collaborated with rapper The Game and appeared on the cover of the influential rap magazine Vibe . <p> Ed Sheeran - You Need Me , I Do n't Need You <p> Although much rap music can be about bragging , intrinsic to Sheeran 's aesthetic is his ability to appear everyday . Material on his debut album , + , had an obsession with promoting his allegiance to reality ( \" Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors/Nationwide tour with Just Jack/Still had to get the bus back \" ) , and his Twitter feed is a constant source of disarming truths , such as \" doing the Victoria secrets fashion show tonight and I 'm eating a Greggs sausage roll in the dressing room \" . <p> Doing the Victoria secrets fashion show tonight and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eric Clarke , professor of music at Oxford University , thinks this is a potent attribute for an artist in 2014 . \" His boy-next-door image -- not very good looks but a perfectly nice guy -- and the song Thinking Out Loud , with its reflections on getting older and fidelity and love in a fairly conventional context , is a slight counter-blast to fast-living celebrity culture . \" <p> This sense of self-imposed legitimacy also taps into the kind of heartfelt testimonies found on X Factor . <p> According to the book Faking It : The Quest for Authenticity in Popular Music , there are three kinds of authenticity in music 's history : cultural authenticity ( appearing true to your culture ) , personal authenticity ( appearing true to yourself ) , and representational authenticity ( not \" faking it \" in terms of how you record your music ) . <p> Hugh Barker , the book 's co-author , says that cultural authenticity has become slightly less important over time as music is increasingly globalised . He says : \" Personal authenticity seems to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very few songs that directly referenced the writer 's life . That changed with songs by people like John Lennon , James Taylor , Carole King -- and since that time autobiography has become ubiquitous , and is often used as a badge of authenticity . \" <p> Ed Sheeran -- Thinking Out Loud <p> A far more straightforward explanation for Sheeran 's global impact lies within his songs . Fiona Bevan , the singer-songwriter who co-wrote One Direction 's Little Things with Sheeran , pins the copyable nature of his songs on the youth market 's current captivation with him . <p> She says : \" Because of the fact that Ed plays solo guitar , and you can hear the acoustic guitar part on the records , the songs are accessible to people to learn to play at home . All his songs are so well written that you can strip away all the production and the songs still stand in their own right . I think the YouTube generation gravitate towards this clear , seemingly simple songwriting when they want to cover their favourite songs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible surge in awareness from fans on YouTube making their own versions and spreading them far and wide . \" <p> To others , Sheeran 's ascent is baffling , perhaps even offensive to those who hoped that the voice of a new generation might be more revolutionary . In 2012 , the influential journalist Caitlin Moran tweeted : \" If my kids ever tell me they like Ed Sheeran , I 'll put them in a sack and throw them in a canal . \" Sheeran 's response was to sidestep a potential social media spat by sending her \" lots of hugs \" via Twitter , prompting regret and a grovelling offer of drinks on the part of Moran . Which just goes to show that you never should underestimate the potency of being nice . <h> Most streamed artists 2014 <p> 1 Ed Sheeran <p> 2 Sam Smith <p> 3 Arctic Monkeys <p> 4 Eminem <p> 5 Calvin Harris <p> 6 Coldplay <p> 7 One Direction <p> 8 Beyonc ? <p> 9 Katy Perry <p> 10 Bastille <p> * This article was amended on 1 January 2015 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Keith Negus , professor of musicology at Goldsmiths , University of London .

"text": "<p> Since the nineties , pioneers of Trance have entered the spotlight but faded into other genres as the industry has changed . Armin Van Buuren however , has provided a consistently strong presence that has seen the Trance community catapult into one of the most connected out there , thanks to the phenomenal event known as ' A State of Trance ' . <p> Since it was first conceived in 2001 , A State of Trance has evolved into a weekly radio show that attracts over 20 million listeners , spread across more than 74 countries . Every year , the show is celebrated in style as ' A State of Trance ' visits countries all around the world , to bring the live show to hundreds of thousands , with state of the art production and a stellar line-up which makes it the number one Trance event to attend . <p> A State of Trance 700 was an important milestone and the first year an entirely new concept was introduced , the ' ASOT Festival ' . The idea was simple , split the event into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a warm-up show in Sydney , the show in Utrecht was the first of many , and home to Armin Van Buuren , curating something we only anticipated as being ultra special . <p> The arena itself was completely indoors and the pure scale of the building was incredible , making the atmosphere completely perfect for an event of this scale . Split into four stages , including two main stages , a ' Who 's Afraid of 138 ? ' stage for those fans wishing to party a little harder and a ' New Talent ' stage to showcase the up and coming Trance DJs of the future , there really was a wide selection available . <p> As we arrived to find our bearings , skimming from stage to stage , it became quite clear where we wanted to spend most of our time . The two main stages offered a significantly ramped up production on the other two , with Mainstage One offering the most in terms of visuals . As big fans of the Anjunabeats label , Mainstage Two offered the most appealing line-up initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a mash-up of Audien 's ' Wayfarer ' and Above &amp; Beyond 's ' Sun &amp; Moon ' provoking the strongest of reactions from the crowd , which we must say , we were n't too impressed with throughout the entire event . There was a lot of people there just stood still , with very little dancing happening . As we moved to Mainstage One again to see Cosmic Gate , we could clearly see why . <p> \" Mainstage One is full \" <p> While there was the potential to expand this stage to a wider area , this message became commonplace throughout the night . We attempted to wait for thirty minutes to get in , but security were keeping a strict admission policy to those with Deluxe tickets only . As a result , we were unable to enter Mainstage One on several occasions , which is why Mainstage Two became the main focus for our review . <p> The production here was nowhere near to the scale of Mainstage One , however the line-up made up for it . As Gareth Emery took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the best Trance sets of all time executed , to the wildest crowd reaction we saw all night . As his set drew to a close , Armin Van Buuren stepped up to the decks where the crowd continued to party hard . Everyone had finally come out of their cage , and the night had begun in style , albeit a few hours too late ! <p> The night soon drew to a close at 07:00 , following a great set from Aly &amp; Fila , who played a tonne of exclusives which left positive memories of the event in our minds . This was also the first time we could get access to Mainstage One . <p> As for the line-up , it was great but prior to the event , the ASOT team surveyed people on Facebook to see who they would like their the most . Gareth Emery , Above &amp; Beyond and Dash Berlin featured the most , but only Gareth Emery made an appearance . This was potentially due to conflicts with Ultra Festival happening at the same time in Buenos Aires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . <p> All in all , A State of Trance 700 ' ASOT Festival ' , was nothing short of impressive . Compared to previous events however , we feel as though there should have just been the one main stage , with capacity significantly increased . ",

"title": "UCI moves to revoke licence of Vincenzo Nibali's team Astana\n",
"text": "<p> In an unprecedented move the world governing body has requested that the Astana team , for whom Vincenzo Nibali won last year 's Tour de France , have their licence revoked . <p> The Union Cycliste Internationale 's move comes after an audit of the team 's anti-doping procedures carried out by the Institute of Sports Science at the University of Lausanne . The UCI was unwilling to comment on any time scale for the process . <p> Astana released a statement on Friday night indicating that they intend to fight the ruling : \" Astana Pro Team has received confirmation from the Union Cycliste International of their receipt of results from the recent audit by the Institute of Sport and Science at the University of Lausanne , and the subsequent transfer of those results to the Independent License Commission . <p> \" Astana Pro Team will consult with its attorneys to prepare documents and testimony before the Independent Licence Commission . Astana Pro Team will reserve its rights pending due process at the Independent Licence Commission to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complies , and any further legal proceedings end in the UCI 's favour , that could potentially mean the end of the team , sponsored by a consortium of Kazakh companies and headed by the controversial former cyclist Alexander Vinokourov . In that event it is possible that Nibali and other star riders , such as the Italian Fabio Aru , would be picked up by other squads . <p> A press release from the UCI stated : \" After careful review of this extensive report the UCI strongly believes that it contains compelling grounds to refer the matter to the licence commission and request the Astana Pro Team licence be revoked . The UCI considers that the audit has , among other things , revealed a big difference between the policies and structures presented to the licence commission in December and the reality on the ground . \" <p> Nibali celebrates victory in the 2014 Tour de France with his Astana team manager Alexander Vinokourov , right . Photograph : Jean-Paul Pelissier/REUTERS <p> The licence commission -- a four-man panel , headed by a Swiss judge , which is independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a four-year long inquiry by Padua magistrates into alleged doping in Italy . <p> The Italian media alleged in December that members of the Astana team had been found to be involved . <p> The newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport claimed that the report found that members of Astana -- not including Nibali -- had been working with Lance Armstrong 's former trainer Michele Ferrari .

"text": "<h> Kapow ! Attack of the feminist superheroes <p> From She-Hulk to Ms Marvel and the new female Thor , a new generation of hero is revolutionising the world of comics and consigning sexualised stereotypes to history . And while some of the ' fan boys ' are grumbling , this is a battle they just wo n't win <p> The action in issue five of the new series of Thor is par for the course in a superhero comic . Absorbing Man , a granite-coloured lug with a wrecking ball , is on a crime spree and Thor , the Norse thunder god who joined the Marvel Comics universe in 1962 , is trying to stop him . The crucial difference in this series is that Thor is now a woman . <p> The scene is writer Jason Aaron 's pointed riposte to the uproar last summer when Marvel announced that the mantle of Thor would pass to a woman and some aggrieved male fans accused the company of pandering to political correctness . For people outside the comic-book world , the backlash seemed to confirm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons . <p> In fact , a seismic upheaval is under way . The new Thor is outselling her predecessor by 30% -- and she 's in good company . Three years ago , writer Kelly Sue DeConnick promoted the former Ms Marvel , Carol Danvers , to Captain Marvel , whose adventures have attracted a loyal cadre of fans called the Carol Corps . Charles Soule reinvented She-Hulk in a witty series that explored her day job as a lawyer . Most significantly , there is G Willow Wilson 's new Ms Marvel , a 16-year-old Pakistani-American Muslim called Kamala Khan . The book has become a cultural phenomenon , covered by CNN , the New York Times and The Colbert Report , and embraced by campaigners against Islamophobia in San Francisco , who plastered over anti-Muslim bus adverts with Kamala stickers . Wilson is currently co-writing an all-female Avengers book , A-Force , with Marguerite Bennett . <p> Marvel 's \" Big Two \" rival DC , meanwhile , has refreshed old female characters such as Batwoman , Batgirl , Catwoman , Wonder Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more progressive world of independent comics , there are socially diverse hit series such as Saga , Rat Queens , Lumberjanes and The Wicked + The Divine . <p> Now that superheroes have taken over the summer box office , what happens in comics has major ramifications for mainstream culture . These are the characters that kids grow up with -- on World Book Day , primary schools teem with pint-sized Spider-Men -- and adults flock to see . The macho lineup of recent movies ( no woman has headlined a comic-book film since Catwoman and Elektra flopped a decade ago ) makes the genre appear immutably male , but Warner Bros has green-lit a long-overdue showcase for DC 's original feminist crimefighter Wonder Woman , while Marvel has scheduled a Captain Marvel movie for 2018 . There are also new TV shows devoted to Captain America 's wartime colleague Peggy Carter , superpowered private detective Jessica Jones , and Supergirl . <p> The speed of change has surprised even the writers . Wilson , who is a Muslim convert , remembers when Marvel editors Sana Amanat and Stephen Wacker approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We want to create a new teenage female American Muslim superhero and put her on her own book . ' I thought , ' You 're insane . You 'll need to hire an intern just to open the hate mail . ' So when , all of a sudden , everybody was talking about it , I was stunned . I believe that if we 'd tried to do the exact same book even five years ago the response would have been very different . It 's coming at a very particular time in the history of American comics . \" <p> When Marvel was expanding rapidly in the 1970s , female superheroes were often afterthoughts , cynically created as brand extensions : Spider-Man begat Spider-Woman , Hulk begat She-Hulk , and so on . <p> \" There was an Adam 's rib effect , \" says Sean Howe , author of the bestselling Marvel Comics : The Untold Story . \" It was n't just that these characters were less well thought-out than their male counterparts ; they were actually derived from their popular holdings . \" ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the female Thor is n't called \" She-Thor or Lady Thunderstrike \" . ) <p> Back then , both the readership and creative roster were overwhelmingly male . While long-time X-Men writer Chris Claremont introduced compelling new women such as Storm , Rogue and Kitty Pryde , their popularity within a team did n't translate into solo success . <p> Rat Queens : one of the new generation of female-led comics . Photograph : Image Comics <p> Ann Nocenti was Claremont 's editor before becoming one of Marvel 's few female writers . Her first assignment was to kill off Spider-Woman . <p> \" Female characters were absolutely seen as secondary , \" she says . \" I ca n't tell if I was just oblivious to sexism and misogyny , but I do n't remember any weird feelings . Not at all . But you would try a female character and the sales would go down . It 's a chicken-and-egg thing . <p> Why did female superheroes fail ? Maybe because nobody was writing for women . I never thought I was writing for women . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters such as Nocenti 's Typhoid Mary , a subversive riff on old female stereotypes , and Claremont 's female X-Men were rare exceptions . Superheroines such as Black Widow and the mutant pop star Dazzler usually played second fiddle , while many artists pandered to adolescent fantasies , drawing superpowered Playmates with wasp-waists , DD busts and frankly impractical costumes . \" An artist would come in with samples and sometimes I 'd look at them and think y'know , I do n't think this guy has a girlfriend or respects women , \" Nocenti remembers . <p> Marguerite Bennett , who co-writes the Thor spin-off Angela : Asgard 's Assassin with Kieron Gillen , remembers being frustrated as a young reader . \" I could n't quite articulate why certain things felt off to me , \" she writes via email . \" Many women were obviously one-dimensional : perfect girlfriends , nagging shrews , femmes fatales -- tragic , scorned , disposable women . But even with living heroines , something felt sour and discordant . These heroines were capable , competent , fearless , and yet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male validation . Most of western literature focuses on male power fantasies . No one much cares about what a female power fantasy would be . \" <p> Most of western literature focuses on male power fantasies . No one much cares about what a female power fantasy would be <p> With depressing regularity , female characters were raped , tortured , maimed or killed in order to spur male heroes into action . In 1999 , Gail Simone , a pioneering figure for the current generation of female writers , documented this trope on the website Women in Refrigerators . Kelly Sue DeConnick invoked another household object when she told Comics Alliance in 2012 : \" Never mind the Bechdel test , try this . If you can replace your female character with a sexy lamp and the story still basically works , maybe you need another draft . They have to be protagonists , not devices . \" For decades , too many female characters failed the Sexy Lamp Test . So why the sudden change ? <p> Last year 's big comic conventions reported approximate gender parity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as male ones . DC co-publisher Jim Lee recently acknowledged that readers were \" looking for a lot more flavours and diversity in our line than we 're currently doing \" . <p> \" It 's tough to expect corporations to be in the vanguard , \" says Howe . \" But even the people looking at the bottom line have the sense that you should have something better to offer women than hourglass figures in Spandex . \" <p> Howe suggests that some new readers have been drawn into the Marvel universe by the onslaught of blockbuster movies . Wilson notes the growing number of female retailers . But they agree that the biggest factor is the internet . Twitter , Tumblr and websites such as Comics Alliance and The Mary Sue , have enabled a more inclusive form of comic book fandom . All the female-led books sell better in digital format than in print . <p> \" When I was a child , comics were relegated to stores that were clearly meant for adult men , \" says Bennett . \" All the same , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and love of those characters provoked me into finding alternate routes to access comics . <p> On the internet , we could have a community of our own . Girls are growing up among these characters . Why should n't they be welcome ? \" <p> Ann Nocenti left the comic book industry in the 90s but returned in 2012 , taking over DC 's Catwoman . Her first convention in years was an eye-opener . \" I looked around and I thought : ' This is half women , half men ! ' It was completely different . I think if I could go back and start writing Catwoman again my stories would be different . I was n't aware there was such a strong female audience . \" <p> Even though the proportion of female creators continues to hover around just 10% , this demographic shift in readership has also changed the way characters are depicted . The costumes designed for Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel by Jamie McKelvie , who draws The Wicked + The Divine , are striking and attractive -- they 're superheroes after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playful illustrations for Charles Soule 's She-Hulk were a breath of fresh air for a character who had spent decades looking like a fitness model . <p> \" She-Hulk has sometimes been portrayed as something of a glamorous , sexy , amazon type , \" Soule writes via email . \" I just presented an extremely competent attorney and superhero who happened to be a beautiful , 7ft-tall green woman . Massively sexualised images of women in mainstream superhero comics are often held up for ridicule these days , which I do n't think would have happened as much even 10 years ago . \" <p> \" People can no longer say : ' Well it 's just you , you 're being oversensitive , ' \" says Wilson . \" There 's a critical mass of people who say : ' Yo , it 's not really OK to portray a 16-year-old girl like a porn star . ' \" <p> The readership is growing and changing and they want to see their stories represented as well <p> Even so , feminist critics such as Asselin routinely receive vicious abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own , milder version of the Gamergate wars that have convulsed the gaming community , as an angry minority of male fans push back at what they perceive as killjoy political correctness . Breitbart 's Gamergate cheerleader Milo Yiannopoulos claims that comics have been hijacked by \" ultra-progressive misandrists who basically hate their own core audiences \" . Some older creators agree . The artist Erik Larsen , co-owner of independent publisher Image Comics , recently grouched on Twitter : \" I 'm tired of the big two placating a vocal minority at the expense of the rest of the paying audience by making more practical women outfits . \" <p> Wilson faced a similar reactionary backlash when Ms Marvel was announced . \" I see why they feel threatened , \" she says . \" They think that there 's a movement afoot to do away with straight , white , male characters all together . Obviously that 's not true . The people who love comics today grew up reading all of that stuff . Nobody 's talking about tearing it all down and beginning from scratch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changing and they want to see their stories represented as well . \" <p> The success of Ms Marvel and Captain Marvel has little to do with identity politics and everything to do with great storytelling . When Carol Danvers had her first solo book as Ms Marvel in 1977 ( \" This Female Fights Back ! \" ) , she was burdened with being Marvel 's token feminist role model : a superpowered Gloria Steinem . The new Ms Marvel , however , is an ordinary adolescent wrestling with parents and school as well as the responsibility of superpowers . Fifty-three years after Stan Lee created Spider-Man , it 's hard for a straight , white man like Peter Parker to represent the gawky underdog . Like the half-black half-Latino Miles Morales , who became a second Spider-Man in 2011 , Kamala Khan is a modern take on a classic archetype . <p> \" We did n't want a model minority book where the whole purpose is to walk around and represent what it 's like to be a south-Asian Muslim in America , \" says Wilson . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a teenager . \" <p> Far from being didactic , these comics honour some of Marvel 's first principles . In the 1960s , superheroes such as Spider-Man outshone DC 's Superman and Batman by having rich , uncostumed lives , with money worries and romantic angst . When The Uncanny X-Men became a phenomenon in the early 80s , Chris Claremont used anti-mutant bigotry as a metaphor for racism and homophobia . These heroes all felt different . Decades later , introducing more LGBT characters and superheroes of colour makes narrative sense . Because the superhero comics industry largely relies on constantly reinventing characters that were created decades ago , it is uniquely well-placed to mirror social change . <p> \" There 's a bit of catchup going on , \" says Howe . \" And yet when you look at stuff like Ms Marvel you can see that comics can also advance attitudes beyond the status quo . I 'm glad that Marvel movies did n't find their greatest success at a time when Marvel comics were filled with enhanced breasts and shrinking hips . \" ",

The inventor , who died aged 39 , was a pioneer who logged 128 patents , including the \" moving coil \" microphone and the first stereophonic recordings , while working as an engineer for EMI . <p> He led the BBC team which successfully chose Marconi-EMI electronic 405-line transmission for the new television medium over the cumbersome mechanical alternative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enigma code , Blumlein , born to a German father and who did not learn to read until he was 13 , turned his skills to the war effort . <p> Blumlein 's revolutionary \" binaural recordings \" used two microphones , recording separately , with the results played in a single groove through two loudspeakers to create the effect we know as \" stereo \" . <p> He incorporated the binaural system into aircraft sound detectors using a cathode ray tube to display the result . This allowed Blumlein 's team to develop an airborne interception system which allowed British planes to detect Germany aircraft by night . <p> Blumlein was killed in the 1942 plane crash which destroyed the prototype of his H2S radar system , which could locate and detect targets from the air regardless of the weather conditions .

If you consider that Alan Turing 's ACE Model Computer used circuits developed by my grandfather you truly start to uncover how across the 128 patents that my grandfather filed , so many elements of our modern-day life have a link back to Alan Blumlein . \" <p> He added : \" With his work on long-distance telephone line interference , stereo , 405-line TV and radar he was a prolific British inventor and genius . \" <p> Professor Anthony Davies , Emeritus Professor of Electronic Engineering at King 's College London , said : \" Blumlein 's many contributions to electronic engineering are not as well known as they should be , and if this plaque helps to remedy that , it will be an extra bonus . <p> \" He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system developed as a blind-bombing aid , which made a huge contribution to the success of night-bombing raids and which allowed accurate night bombing for the first time by the Allies . \" <p> The plaque recognises Blumlein 's stereo sound achievements of the early 1930s . \" All vinyl gramophone records which record stereo in a single groove use his inventions , \" professor Davies went on . <p> \" The EMI television system to which he contributed much was the basis of TV technology from the start of TV broadcasting from Alexandra Palace in 1936 until the recent change to digital technology . \" ",

"title": "Your favourite secret corners of the British countryside - mapped\n",
"text": "<p> Last week was the start of a new series of Secret Britain , the BBC1 show where the corn-fed duo of Adam Henson and Ellie Harrison ferret out the forgotten corners of our countryside . Cue plenty of sunlight sparkling through waterfalls and the word \" amazing \" . <p> To mark the first episode -- and to perhaps trump their selections -- we invited you to share your own secret parts of Britain . Hundreds of comments later , at least half of you harrumphed that you 'd be keeping your favourite place to yourself , thank you very much , lest it be overrun by quinoa-picnicking Guardianistas . But just as many shared a wealth of fascinatingly obscure spots , from remote Scottish islands to the industrial north-east , forgotten Home Counties villages and southwestern woodlands . <p> We 've collated all your suggestions and plotted them on the Google map below -- zoom in and click on each entry to read what the commenter said about it . The best ( and sometimes positively poetic ) comments have been embedded further down . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really unusual picture of the UK -- just do n't all visit each place at once ... <p> Rowarth , near Stockport , on the old Cheshire/Derbyshire border . In fact , the whole area between Mellor and New Mills is truly magnificent . The Roman Lakes are so-so , bit too touristy for my liking , but has its moments . <p> You get a great view from the top of Kinder Scout , but you get some odd looks if you hold a champaign party there . <p> There 's nothing secret about Morston Marshes , Salthouse or Cley , but there are some delightful trails through the heathland thereabouts . The adders wo n't bother you unless you tread on them . I suggest walking the trails or cycling from the coast inland through Holt ( great shops there ) to Hunworth ( best pub in the area ) and around . <p> Meavy , a largely-forgotten village in the south of England ( probably of its own doing ) is in a magnificent area . The Meavy Oak is the real reason Britain has never been conquered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honestly , never had much time for much of the British Isles - overpopulated , touristy , massive destruction of heritage and landscape . A disgrace to the nation . <p> The Ashdown Forest - largest expanse of open heathland in the southeast , and the setting for the Winnie the Pooh books , but hardly anybody has heard of it . In particular Gill 's Lap , and the views over several counties from the Broadstone carpark . The Long Mynd near Church Stretton in Shropshire is better known , and beautiful . <p> A little sheltered spot on a permissive path/track between the shoulder of a moor with views across to the Three Peaks from the Forest of Bowland and another set of moors on the Lancashire/Yorkshire border . It has been a respite from the wind and a place to rest and have a flask cuppa or make hot food when on my bike a couple of times . That 's all you 're getting . <p> From the Norwich to Wroxham road in Norfolk , turn right onto Muck Lane . Drive through Salhouse to Woodbastwick ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the No Through Road sign - that 's where you are going . Drive past the couple of houses and you are suddenly driving through the marshes . Take care : off the edge of the road is deep bog . But at the far end you will find parking and the river , with a pub on the other side and holiday makers puttering up and down in their hire boats . Get out and walk along the boardwalk to Cockshoot Broad . You will turn off the main river into a quiet , magical world . Birds and dragonflies , trees with hanging moss , bees , ... <p> The best time ever to do this is on a frosty winter morning , when you may annoy the heron , but you wo n't meet anyone else . <p> Brownsham Woods , near Clovelly in Spring is lovely , a wander through beautiful bluebell woods with a stream meandering through it and then you come out high up on the coast path , facing the wild Atlantic ocean , turn left and follow the coast path to Clovelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , right on the cliffs . I used to live near there and miss it very much . That whole North Devon coastline is an absolute gem . <p> Hastings country park : secret coves , wooded glens , sandstone fern and flowering gorse covered cliffs , secluded beaches , waterfalls , dinosaur footprints , wildflowers , views of france , beach head and white cliffs of Dover , shetland ponies and highland cattle , and then down into the old town for fresh seafood and lively pubs . <p> Wycollar Dean , near Trawden , Lancashire . Wild moorland sweeps down to pasture land replete with prehistoric stone walking . In the village , the beck runs through a cobbled ford in front of the ruins of Wycoller Hall , famed as Fern Dean Manor in Jane Eyre . There are four bridges across the beck , including a single slab clapper bridge . Beautiful country park that provides a gateway to some of the most wildly beautiful and historically fascinating countryside in England . <p> The Ben Alder area of the Scottish Highlands , on the west side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to storm through at speeds where you are n't going to appreciate the beauty around you it 's the kind of place where you need to pack a tent and wild camp to see most of it . <p> It 's remote , it 's wild and you could easily spend days at a time without seeing another human , you 're more likely to see a stag . Simply stunning . <p> on the main road between broseley and much wenlock , near barrow there is a layby . It leads to a permissive right of way through the wood . Follow into a field with views towards bridgnorth . Exit at the top and follow the lane past wild wood You go along what looks like an ancient path way with a stone bank on your left . Eventually you meat the old border of Willey estates . Follow this down into Willey village . Quiet , unspoilt and you could be standing int he same spot 200 years ago . Similarly just down the road is Benthall edge . The quieter , but more beautiful cousin to Wenlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Severn gorge . These woods are like an enchanted forest . You truly believe that fairies do exist here . In May the bluebells in Benthall edge woods are more beautiful than anything you can imagine . On a lucky day , you can see a dear . Walking through these woods is my happny place , and is more magical than anything else I 've ever known . <p> Travelling north across Rannoch Moor the road takes a wee chicane to the right and then left , round a rocky outcrop . Up on top of the rocks is a bench overlooking the moor , and some hidden pools and waterfalls . Most people go whizzing past in their cars without even noticing it . I only noticed it as I huffed and puffed along on my fully laden bike on a camping trip . Great little spot to stop and admire the view over the moor as people rush past far below , oblivious to the tranquility above . <p> My own private island - not that I own the land itself , but it belongs to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my version of Yeats ' Lake Isle of Inisfree . I can be there in an instant simply by closing my eyes , but even better is to actually be there , watching the lighthouse beams flash out as the sun sets over the Irish Sea , and listening for the first night time call of the Manx shearwater . I 'm not telling you any more . If you know it , you 'll know where I mean . <p> I was on Winchelsea Beach last summer . The tide was out and had let the top layer of sand dry enough so when the wind picked up you got this otherworldly effect of ghoulish sand blowing across the surface . <p> Not exactly secret but an extraordinary thing . In the midst of heavy industrial Essex just off the A13 , downstream from Crossness Sewage Treatment works , overlooked by the HS1 train line , sits Rainham Marshes RSPB nature reserve on land that used to be a practice artillery range . I do n't work there , I 'm telling you because I 'd like it to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us in this part of the world . <p> I live in North Northumberland too . My favourite place is down a forestry track in deepest Kielder forest . Then I slide down a bank covered in deep rich smelling moss . At the bottom is a perfect stream with small waterfalls and pools . In the summer it is dripping with green from ferns , moss and lichen that hangs off the trees like beards . There is no road noise . It is a small little place I like to sit and watch my dog pad about happily . I can spend five minutes there or an hour . No one else is ever there . It is as secret as I believe it can be . <p> The Bowland area in Western Pennines , Lancashire . The bare fells were amazing to a Scandinavian who can not see the scenery for all the endless forests at home . And the hotel at Whitewell served a lovely Sunday lunch . <p> There may be quieter mountains in Wales , but not many of them will enjoy such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the more famous Aran , Arenig , Rhinogydd and Cadair Idris ranges , it gets very little footfall , so you can sit alone on the rocky summit and enjoy looking at these busier mountains in peace , right in the middle of them . <p> Many years ago I used to go fishing for sticklebacks in the River Caldew . There is a spot there beside the river opposite Cummersdale and just down the road from Blackwell which is so heavenly peaceful and perfectly beautiful that I have promised myself that when my time comes I will sit me down with a bottle of Scotch and some pain killers and simply float off into non-existence . <p> Whitbarrow , South Lakeland . A four mile long chunk of limestone with the most perfect , if windswept views of Morecambe Bay and the high fells of Lakeland . Carpeted by low clinging Juniper bushes , limestone clints , and wind shaped ash and elder trees . Coppiced woodland with bluebells rampant on the east slope and a sheer limestone cliff on the west . Curlews and birds of prey circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast summit plain . Heaven when the skies are blue , with The cairn at Lord 's Seat being the perfect picnic and viewing spot . There are even natural limestone seats and rocks to shelter from the wind . <p> You 're allowed to rough camp on Dartmoor but the trouble is most of it is too tussocky or rocky or wet to want to . However , I know an absolutely pristine and perfectly flat few square m of short cropped grass , right next to a leet where you have crystal clear water running off the moor to drink or cook with . <p> The Farley Water Valley on Exmoor near to the Village of Brendon . Secluded , beautiful , peaceful . A place to spread yourself on the ground by the stream and stare at the sky . The odd sheep or cow might wander by and stop to ponder you for a moment before remembering that humans are infinitely less interesting than grass . <p> Glen Carnach in Knoydart just round the corner from the Sourlies bothy ... on a sunny day this place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camping and stunning vistas ... a fair few hours walk from any kind of civilisation ... if the shit hits the fan this is where you 'll find me ! <p> There 's about 500 other spots on the north west coast of Scotland I could mention as well ! <p> Any more for any more ?

"lower_text": "<p> last week was the start of a new series of secret britain , the bbc1 show where the corn-fed duo of adam henson and ellie harrison ferret out the forgotten corners of our countryside . cue plenty of sunlight sparkling through waterfalls and the word \" amazing \" . <p> to mark the first episode -- and to perhaps trump their selections -- we invited you to share your own secret parts of britain . hundreds of comments later , at least half of you harrumphed that you 'd be keeping your favourite place to yourself , thank you very much , lest it be overrun by quinoa-picnicking guardianistas . but just as many shared a wealth of fascinatingly obscure spots , from remote scottish islands to the industrial north-east , forgotten home counties villages and southwestern woodlands . <p> we 've collated all your suggestions and plotted them on the google map below -- zoom in and click on each entry to read what the commenter said about it . the best ( and sometimes positively poetic ) comments have been embedded further down . thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really unusual picture of the uk -- just do n't all visit each place at once ... <p> rowarth , near stockport , on the old cheshire/derbyshire border . in fact , the whole area between mellor and new mills is truly magnificent . the roman lakes are so-so , bit too touristy for my liking , but has its moments . <p> you get a great view from the top of kinder scout , but you get some odd looks if you hold a champaign party there . <p> there 's nothing secret about morston marshes , salthouse or cley , but there are some delightful trails through the heathland thereabouts . the adders wo n't bother you unless you tread on them . i suggest walking the trails or cycling from the coast inland through holt ( great shops there ) to hunworth ( best pub in the area ) and around . <p> meavy , a largely-forgotten village in the south of england ( probably of its own doing ) is in a magnificent area . the meavy oak is the real reason britain has never been conquered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly , never had much time for much of the british isles - overpopulated , touristy , massive destruction of heritage and landscape . a disgrace to the nation . <p> the ashdown forest - largest expanse of open heathland in the southeast , and the setting for the winnie the pooh books , but hardly anybody has heard of it . in particular gill 's lap , and the views over several counties from the broadstone carpark . the long mynd near church stretton in shropshire is better known , and beautiful . <p> a little sheltered spot on a permissive path/track between the shoulder of a moor with views across to the three peaks from the forest of bowland and another set of moors on the lancashire/yorkshire border . it has been a respite from the wind and a place to rest and have a flask cuppa or make hot food when on my bike a couple of times . that 's all you 're getting . <p> from the norwich to wroxham road in norfolk , turn right onto muck lane . drive through salhouse to woodbastwick ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the no through road sign - that 's where you are going . drive past the couple of houses and you are suddenly driving through the marshes . take care : off the edge of the road is deep bog . but at the far end you will find parking and the river , with a pub on the other side and holiday makers puttering up and down in their hire boats . get out and walk along the boardwalk to cockshoot broad . you will turn off the main river into a quiet , magical world . birds and dragonflies , trees with hanging moss , bees , ... <p> the best time ever to do this is on a frosty winter morning , when you may annoy the heron , but you wo n't meet anyone else . <p> brownsham woods , near clovelly in spring is lovely , a wander through beautiful bluebell woods with a stream meandering through it and then you come out high up on the coast path , facing the wild atlantic ocean , turn left and follow the coast path to clovelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , right on the cliffs . i used to live near there and miss it very much . that whole north devon coastline is an absolute gem . <p> hastings country park : secret coves , wooded glens , sandstone fern and flowering gorse covered cliffs , secluded beaches , waterfalls , dinosaur footprints , wildflowers , views of france , beach head and white cliffs of dover , shetland ponies and highland cattle , and then down into the old town for fresh seafood and lively pubs . <p> wycollar dean , near trawden , lancashire . wild moorland sweeps down to pasture land replete with prehistoric stone walking . in the village , the beck runs through a cobbled ford in front of the ruins of wycoller hall , famed as fern dean manor in jane eyre . there are four bridges across the beck , including a single slab clapper bridge . beautiful country park that provides a gateway to some of the most wildly beautiful and historically fascinating countryside in england . <p> the ben alder area of the scottish highlands , on the west side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to storm through at speeds where you are n't going to appreciate the beauty around you it 's the kind of place where you need to pack a tent and wild camp to see most of it . <p> it 's remote , it 's wild and you could easily spend days at a time without seeing another human , you 're more likely to see a stag . simply stunning . <p> on the main road between broseley and much wenlock , near barrow there is a layby . it leads to a permissive right of way through the wood . follow into a field with views towards bridgnorth . exit at the top and follow the lane past wild wood you go along what looks like an ancient path way with a stone bank on your left . eventually you meat the old border of willey estates . follow this down into willey village . quiet , unspoilt and you could be standing int he same spot 200 years ago . similarly just down the road is benthall edge . the quieter , but more beautiful cousin to wenlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severn gorge . these woods are like an enchanted forest . you truly believe that fairies do exist here . in may the bluebells in benthall edge woods are more beautiful than anything you can imagine . on a lucky day , you can see a dear . walking through these woods is my happny place , and is more magical than anything else i 've ever known . <p> travelling north across rannoch moor the road takes a wee chicane to the right and then left , round a rocky outcrop . up on top of the rocks is a bench overlooking the moor , and some hidden pools and waterfalls . most people go whizzing past in their cars without even noticing it . i only noticed it as i huffed and puffed along on my fully laden bike on a camping trip . great little spot to stop and admire the view over the moor as people rush past far below , oblivious to the tranquility above . <p> my own private island - not that i own the land itself , but it belongs to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my version of yeats ' lake isle of inisfree . i can be there in an instant simply by closing my eyes , but even better is to actually be there , watching the lighthouse beams flash out as the sun sets over the irish sea , and listening for the first night time call of the manx shearwater . i 'm not telling you any more . if you know it , you 'll know where i mean . <p> i was on winchelsea beach last summer . the tide was out and had let the top layer of sand dry enough so when the wind picked up you got this otherworldly effect of ghoulish sand blowing across the surface . <p> not exactly secret but an extraordinary thing . in the midst of heavy industrial essex just off the a13 , downstream from crossness sewage treatment works , overlooked by the hs1 train line , sits rainham marshes rspb nature reserve on land that used to be a practice artillery range . i do n't work there , i 'm telling you because i 'd like it to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us in this part of the world . <p> i live in north northumberland too . my favourite place is down a forestry track in deepest kielder forest . then i slide down a bank covered in deep rich smelling moss . at the bottom is a perfect stream with small waterfalls and pools . in the summer it is dripping with green from ferns , moss and lichen that hangs off the trees like beards . there is no road noise . it is a small little place i like to sit and watch my dog pad about happily . i can spend five minutes there or an hour . no one else is ever there . it is as secret as i believe it can be . <p> the bowland area in western pennines , lancashire . the bare fells were amazing to a scandinavian who can not see the scenery for all the endless forests at home . and the hotel at whitewell served a lovely sunday lunch . <p> there may be quieter mountains in wales , but not many of them will enjoy such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the more famous aran , arenig , rhinogydd and cadair idris ranges , it gets very little footfall , so you can sit alone on the rocky summit and enjoy looking at these busier mountains in peace , right in the middle of them . <p> many years ago i used to go fishing for sticklebacks in the river caldew . there is a spot there beside the river opposite cummersdale and just down the road from blackwell which is so heavenly peaceful and perfectly beautiful that i have promised myself that when my time comes i will sit me down with a bottle of scotch and some pain killers and simply float off into non-existence . <p> whitbarrow , south lakeland . a four mile long chunk of limestone with the most perfect , if windswept views of morecambe bay and the high fells of lakeland . carpeted by low clinging juniper bushes , limestone clints , and wind shaped ash and elder trees . coppiced woodland with bluebells rampant on the east slope and a sheer limestone cliff on the west . curlews and birds of prey circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast summit plain . heaven when the skies are blue , with the cairn at lord 's seat being the perfect picnic and viewing spot . there are even natural limestone seats and rocks to shelter from the wind . <p> you 're allowed to rough camp on dartmoor but the trouble is most of it is too tussocky or rocky or wet to want to . however , i know an absolutely pristine and perfectly flat few square m of short cropped grass , right next to a leet where you have crystal clear water running off the moor to drink or cook with . <p> the farley water valley on exmoor near to the village of brendon . secluded , beautiful , peaceful . a place to spread yourself on the ground by the stream and stare at the sky . the odd sheep or cow might wander by and stop to ponder you for a moment before remembering that humans are infinitely less interesting than grass . <p> glen carnach in knoydart just round the corner from the sourlies bothy ... on a sunny day this place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camping and stunning vistas ... a fair few hours walk from any kind of civilisation ... if the shit hits the fan this is where you 'll find me ! <p> there 's about 500 other spots on the north west coast of scotland i could mention as well ! <p> any more for any more ? feel free to add any additional suggestions below .

"text": "<h> James Kirkup says the Conservative manifesto pledge of 30 hours a week of free childcare shows the party has finally come to terms with modern British life <p> The Conservative promise of 30 hours a week of free childcare for 3- and 4-year-olds is big news , bigger than the Right to Buy , bigger than tax cuts . Working parents are now the No 1 target for the Conservative re-election effort . <p> Yes , there will be questions about how the Tories will fund it : will their tax raid on the pension contributions of high-earners really cover the cost ? And doubtless some will wonder if there are sufficient providers . <p> But that 's secondary . The main point is that the Conservatives have decided to reach out to working parents and say , \" We get it . We understand the hassle and difficulty of combining children and work . \" <p> Cameron launches Tory manifesto <p> The unspoken message : \" We know you think Tories are rich men who are n't be bothered about this stuff because we have nannies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , but actually , we do understand . \" <p> The usual election promise caveat applies , of course : no pledge made 20-odd days before voting is likely to fundamentally transform any party 's image . But just as it was smart for Labour to finally address its economic credibility problem , it 's smart for the Tories to reach out to working parents in an attempt to address their \" people like us \" problem . <p> The Conservative childcare pledge is important for another reason too . For a long time , the Tories have tied themselves up in knots about the question of work and children . Even though the party 's leadership believes that it would be a good thing , economically and socially , if more women with children were to work , Tories have been wary of making that case . <p> The reason for the caution is the party 's attachment to the notion that mothers should stay at home with their children instead of working . Tension with the stay-at-home mother ( SAHM , if you 're a Mumsnetter ) lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalition government implemented , as \" family values \" Tories complain that single-earner families are not benefitting from things aimed at making lives easier for families where both parents work . <p> General Election 2015 - what are the possible outcomes ? <p> Listening to the SAHM lobby is rarely good politics for the Tories . It makes the party look old-fashioned and out-of-touch with modern life . Whatever the cause , whatever the rights and wrongs of it , more women are working : the employment rate for women is now 68.5 per cent , up from 56.9 per cent in 1980 . There 's also some evidence that being a single-earner household is increasingly the preserve of the very poor or the very rich : the majority of parents in the middle , by choice or necessity , both work . <p> Accepting these things does n't , incidentally , imply any judgement on those who do stay at home to raise their children . It simply means accepting facts for what they are . <p> Working and raising your children , at the same time - that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conservatives have finally decided to get over their fear of the stay-at-home mother brigade and admit it .

"text": "<p> Make the most of the magnificent views along the Northumberland coast while savouring the best local seafood at these cafes and restaurants where affordable lunch menus make it possible to fill up without splashing out <p> In this roundup the focus is on Northumberland , so Tyne and Wear ( North Shields , Tynemouth , Whitley Bay ) are not featured -- though they may be included in a forthcoming article <h> The Old Boat House , Amble <p> Back in the days when Freddie the Dolphin was attracting national headlines , Amble was a rough-and-ready fishing port with an excellent fish and chip shop : the Quayside Cafe and Chippy in Fish Market ( it 's still there and still great ) . In the past few years , the area round the fish dock has had a facelift . There 's now a seafood centre with occasional pop-up dining , a cluster of \" pod \" shops and a fantastic Italian ice-cream parlour , Spurreli , that has drawn praise from Jean-Christophe Novelli . For seafood , the Old Boat House is the place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has a no-frills interior of pine floors , simple wooden tables and chairs and industrial lighting . The fish is seriously good -- and could include oysters from Lindisfarne , sweet pickled herrings , or soft shell crabs -- though you need to pick carefully if you 're sticking to a budget . The owners also run the restaurant at nearby Blyth Boathouse . * Mains from ? 10 . Leazes Street . 01665 711232 , boathousefoodgroup.co.uk . Open Sun-Thurs noon-9pm , Fri-Sat noon-9.30pm <h> The Ship Inn , Low Newton-by-the-Sea <p> This is the sort of ideal English coastal pub you expect to encounter only in a Famous Five book . The interior has a monastic simplicity and when the weather is bright you can sit outside and gaze at the rock pools and beach , which in the summer is covered with the sort of families who look like they 've stepped out of a clothing catalogue ( a friend once cruelly dubbed the village Boden-on-Sea ) . At lunch , the Ship serves rich kipper p ? t ? from Swallow Fish in Seahouses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mayonnaise . Dinner is more expensive . The Ship also has a small brewery : the Sea Coal dark wheat beer is particularly choice. *Lunch dishes from ? 6. 01665 576262 , shipinnnewton.co.uk . Open Mon-Sat 11am-11pm , Sun noon-10pm ( lunch served noon-2.30pm daily ; dinner 7pm-8pm Weds-Sat ) <h> The Joiners Arms , High Newton-by-the-Sea <p> Owned by the same operation that has half-a-dozen calculatingly overblown places on Tyneside -- including Floritas Miami Bar and Tropical Garden ( my daughter speaks warmly of it ) -- the Joiners has stone-flagged floor , log fire and carefully mismatched lampshades in the bar , while the dining room looks like the inside of the hotel in Twin Peaks . Food is more down to earth . Budget diners need to stick to the light bites section , where there are juicy Holy Island mussels in classic white wine and garlic sauce , and an excellent chowder of smoked fish , white fish and seafood . Sandwiches ( served from noon till 3pm ) include fish fingers with tartar sauce. *Dishes from ? 7.50. 01665 576112 , joiners-arms.com . Lunch noon-3.30pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shack , Alnmouth <p> Beaches restaurant has had a high reputation for its fresh fish dishes for nearly two decades , but is slightly too expensive for us . This year , however , the owners have opened a seafood shack next door for informal easy eating , and it certainly hits the spot . The fish here comes straight from Alnmouth bay to kitchen , to plate . Deliciously velvety crab soup and bread , paella pot with chorizo and seafood and California-style crabcakes all come in at under a fiver , while the half lobster with mornay sauce and chips is ? 9.95 . There are tables and benches outside , or you can take your food and eat it overlooking the bay. *Dishes from ? 3.95. 56 Northumberland Street , 01665 830006 , beachesrestaurant.co.uk . Open Tues-Weds and Sunday from \" lunchtime to early evening \" ( around 6.30pm ) <h> The Jolly Fisherman , Craster <p> Craster was named as the birthplace of the kipper by Clarissa Dickson Wright ( there are other claimants ) . The Jolly Fisherman is a neat whitewashed building on the harbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the North Sea . Chef John Blackmore is a veteran of the Northumberland food scene and makes good use of local produce . At lunchtime , there 's crab soup with great sourdough bread from the Running Fox bakery in Felton , **25;1217;TOOLONG fishcakes with proper chips , and warm crab toasts with sweetcorn chowder all for under a tenner . Dinner is pricier. *Sandwiches from ? 5.25 , Mains at lunch from ? 7.95 . Haven Hill , 01665 576461 , **30;1244;TOOLONG . Open Mon-Sat 11am-11pm ( food served 11am-3pm and 5pm-8.30pm ( 9pm in holiday season ) , Sunday noon-11pm ( food noon-7pm ) <h> Piper 's Pitch , Craster <p> This spic-and-span caravan has been a fixture in the main Craster car park for nearly a decade . Owner Andy Grant serves good coffee , cakes and scones , but most people come for the butties . The glisteningly buttery grilled Craster kipper bap is very fine , though arguably Grant 's most famous delicacy is the Auchtermuchty Sandwich . However , since that features haggis and bacon , it is outside our purview . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it might. * Sandwiches from ? 3 . Courtyard of the Tourist Information Centre , Craster , Facebook page . Open Mon 10am-4pm , Tue-Fri 10am-4.30pm , Sat-Sun 10am-5pm <h> The Craster Seafood Restaurant <p> Sharing premises with L Robson 's smokehouse , built in 1856 , this restaurant has a slight South American tinge thanks to a Brazilian chef ( which explains the presence of casquinha de siri -- a spicy crab dish -- on the menu ) . The interior is simple : exposed stone walls , pine floors , white wooden chairs -- and the picture windows have fantastic views across the harbour to the ruins of Dunstanburgh castle . As you might expect , the emphasis is on produce from Robson 's , and the lunch menu features excellent smoked salmon , smoked haddock soup , homemade fish p ? t ? s , and grilled kippers -- smoked for 16 hours using oak and whitewood shavings . Dinner is more elaborate and more expensive. * Sandwiches from ? 5.95 , mains at lunch from ? 6.50 . Haven Hill , 01665 576223 , kipper.co.uk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> The Olde Ship Inn , Seahouses <p> I first ate here 25 years ago and even then the swirly carpeting brought back memories of the 1970s . Fitted throughout with a perfect storm of nautical nick-nackery , the Olde Ship 's snug bar looks like a captain 's cabin and seems to list slightly to one side ( though that may have been because I usually visit fresh from the Farne Islands boat ) . It serves old-fashioned , pre-gastro-pub bar food that also includes excellent Holy Island mussels , smoked salmon fishcakes and locally landed hake as well as gammon and chips . There 's lobster , too , if your wallet is up to it , and good beer from Hadrian Border Brewery. * Mains from ? 9.50 . Main Street , Seahouses , 01665 720200 , seahouses.co.uk . Open daily , lunch noon-2pm ( sandwiches served till 2.30pm ) . Dinner 7pm-8.30pm <h> Pilgrims Coffee House , Lindisfarne <p> For all its many charms , the Holy Island of Lindisfarne is a bit under-served for food , despite having the north-east 's only oyster farm and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffee bar set up a decade ago in an old bric-a-brac shop and its crab sandwiches are some of the beston this coast . The crab is from nearby Embleton and served on granary bread from Trotters in Seahouses . Owner Andrew Mundy roasts his own coffee beans in a shed in the garden . There are also excellent cakes - including caraway-spiked Cuthbert Cake named in honour of Northumberland 's patron saint -- and good beer from the Wylam brewery . There 's a sheltered garden at the back. * Crab sandwiches ? 4.95 . Falkland House , Marygate , 01289 389109 , pilgrimscoffee.com . Open Tues-Sun 10am-5pm , closed Monday <h> Audela , Berwick-upon-Tweed <p> Unfairly overlooked , possibly because no one is quite sure what country it is in ( England ) , Berwick-upon-Tweed has much to recommend it . Even though some of the fresh seafood at Audela -- an airy place just along the road from the Bridge Street Bazaar antique market -- comes from nearby Eyemouth in Scotland , it is certainly worthy of a place here , especially since you can eat fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with toasted bread from James Ford and Sons is ? 6 and , at lunch , there is smoked haddock with spinach hollandaise , a poached egg and saut ? d potatoes for ? 7.95 .

"text": "<h> BARS <h> Lantern 's Keep , Midtown West <p> Opened in the early 1900s , both the Algonquin and the Iroquois hotels exude the glamour of times past . Inside , the Algonquin has its famed Round Table restaurant , where Dorothy Parker gathered with editors of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker . But the Iroquois has a hidden little jewel box of a cocktail bar called Lantern 's Keep . There 's no sign for it , but in-the-know imbibers are aware that if the lantern affixed to the Iroquois 's facade is lit , they can go inside and have a drink . Lantern 's Keep opened in 2011 , but you would n't know it from the decor , which looks more like a Parisian beaux-arts salon than a New York bar . Chic black panelling contrasts with marble tables and Louis XIV chairs upholstered in powder blue velvet . Head bartender John Ploeser and his team designed the list of 40 cocktails , from the refreshing Regal Business ( gin , grapefruit , honey , lime ) to the boozy Double Barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and orange bitters ) . Ploeser has a polite , midwestern air that makes him instantly likeable and easy to talk to and he loves the social aspect of bartending. *49 West 44th Street , +1 212 435 4287 , **27;1739;TOOLONG . Open Mon-Fri 5pm-midnight ; Sat 6pm-1am <h> Blind Barber , Lower East Side <p> Alphabet City was the first location for Blind Barber , which opened in 2010 and has since expanded to Williamsburg and Los Angeles . The entrance is a working two-seat barbershop . Designed to feel like a retro dentist office , even the barber 's tools are on rolling dental trays . The back room bar is hidden behind a rolling door , which opens up to a large lounge . And the name ? It 's a reference to the titles given to speakeasies during prohibition such as Blind Tiger and Blind Pig , a message to policemen to turn a blind eye to the activities going on behind the scenes . The cocktail menu has a core selection of classics , including Strawberry Fields with vodka , lemon juice , honey , strawberries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jalapeno-infused Combier , lemon juice , cucumber , and ginger . The seasonal cocktails change in fall and spring , and pizza is provided until 10pm by Gnocco next door . <p> Back to the barbershop : the small room takes advantage of the original exposed brick of the building and the decor features distressed metal boards , vintage Koker barbershop chairs , and wooden auditorium seats . The underlying concept is a nod to the barbershops of yore where a community would come together . To that end , Blind Barber offers a drink with your shave -- anything from spirits to beer . Just no cocktails until the bar opens at 6pm. * 339 East 10th Street , +1 212 228 2123 , blindbarber.com . Backroom open Mon-Sat 6pm-4am , Barbershop noon-9pm , Sun noon-6pm <h> Nublu , East Village <p> During the day , the outside of Nublu looks like a shuttered storefront , with metal grates perpetually down except for where the slats have broken off . Sometime between 2013 and 2014 , street art appeared which added a splash of colour . At night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light marking the entrance . Inside , however , activity is truly buzzing , as Nublu has become a stronghold for musical improvisation across genres . Nublu had humble beginnings in 2002 as a simple clubhouse where friends of owner Ilhan Ersahin would come and play music . Ersahin , himself a musician , describes its early days as more of a rehearsal space . He acquired the wine and beer licence just so they could drink during and between jams , as the space was always open to the public . It 's a haven for musicians getting their careers started , as well as for famous ones such as Moby , Norah Jones and David Byrne , who come to perform secret shows or take in the latest sounds . At the bar , expect a wide range of sake , along with beers and wine . *62 Avenue C , +1 347 529 5923 , nublu.net . Weekdays : first band 9pm , late band at 11pm and 1am ; weekends first band at 9pm , late band at midnight and 2am <h> No Name Bar , Greenpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 597 Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint not only lacks a name , it does n't even have a phone . \" It might sound like a cliche , but I wanted to bring back a sense of discovery , \" says owner Jessica Lee Wertz . The only entrance marker is the antique bronze door knocker shaped like a Chinese dragon . Push the door open and you 'll be in a long , narrow bar that feels like the Orient Express . Opposite the bar , a series of narrow benches with tiny tables are reminiscent of train cars . The space is outfitted in reclaimed wood with design elements inspired by China , Japan , and Morocco . When Wertz first opened the bar in 2010 , she recognised everyone who came to drink there . Now , there are always new faces . It 's the kind of place where you can order an old fashioned and your friend can have a Budweiser , and there 's no judgment either way . Many chefs and servers from the surrounding restaurants come in for a nightcap , since No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open until 4am every night. *597 Manhattan Avenue , Brooklyn , on Facebook . Open Sun-Thurs 3pm-4am , Fri-Sat noon-4am <h> William Barnacle Tavern at 80 St Marks , East Village <p> Though the William Barnacle Tavern itself is no longer hidden , the bar is one of the few authentic speakeasies left over from prohibition , and the building itself still holds a rich history of secrets -- including intact mafia escape tunnels and safes . The entrance to the bar was originally through a butcher shop next door , concealed from the street . Behind the bar was a dance hall , which later became a jazz club and is now the theatre . The William Barnacle Tavern specialises in absinthe -- 28 variations of it -- and single malt whiskies . The bar owner , Lorcan Otway , used to be a shipbuilder , so the maritime theme of the bar is a nod to his past , creating a dive-y , non self-conscious pub . Unlike many of the trendier prohibition-style bars in New York City , the tavern is not only authentic , but every item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorcan and his family . Lorcan himself is often behind the bar , too , making 1920s-inspired cocktails or serving absinthe. *80 St Marks Place , +1 212 388 0388 , on Facebook . Open Mon-Fri 6pm-2am , Sunday 1pm-2am <h> RESTAURANTS <h> La Esquina , Soho <p> The name of this place ( \" the corner \" ) would have you think it 's just your average tiny taqueria . From the outside , it looks casual , like an old Mexican diner , with corrugated tin siding and a neon sign . You could come here and just get tacos to go -- but then you may get curious about where the people disappearing through the door inside the narrow taqueria are going . If you have a reservation or are lucky enough to get in without one , the host will open the door and you 'll walk downstairs , through the kitchen and into the main brasserie . Upstairs , everything is bright , but here it 's dimly lit . Past a row of iron bars , the dining room feels a bit like a dungeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room are dripping in wax . A soundtrack of pop music sets a party mood . La Esquina is known for its margaritas and they 're the perfect complement to the Mexican street food . There 's the classic elotes callejeros ( grilled corn on the cob smothered in mayonnaise , cotija cheese , and lime juice ) , ceviche , and queso fundido ( melted cheese with pumpkin seeds and chile de arbol ) that arrives in a cast-iron pan with plantain chips for dipping . And there are tacos ( around $5 a taco ) in all varieties : grilled steak , chicken , fish of the day , cheese , veal tongue , carnitas , and slow-roasted pulled pork. *114 Kenmare Street , +1 646 613 7100 , esquinanyc.com . Open daily 6pm-2am <h> Sakagura , Midtown East <p> Open for almost 20 years , Sakagura is found in the basement of a nondescript Midtown office building . Cross the threshold of the restaurant , however , and you 'll feel as if you 've entered a Japanese village . The decor is such that diners have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like houses , replete with windows , shutters and dormer roofs . Though the architecture is n't an exercise of purist Japanese form , the raised level of the sake bar area , a mini Shinto shrine , and rice paper dividers give it a homey feel . It 's one of the finest places for Japanese food in the city -- and at affordable prices . As an appetiser , try the Washu beef self-cooked on hot stones , a sea urchin soup with soft boiled egg and salmon roe , the onsen tamago ( a slow-cooked poached egg in cold soup ) , the buta no kakuni ( a special stewed diced-pork dish ) , or the chawanmushi egg custard topped with ponzu soup .

When it was a glass factory , from the 1870s to the 1930s , the workers would cart their wares through the courtyard to the back exit , which opens onto Newtown Creek . Now , the factory 's enormous kiln door hangs in the courtyard and an original ceramic basin holds plants . As owner-developer Sarah Conklin prepared to open she spent months researching the building and found antique etchings of the factory 's fixtures -- now hanging by the entrance -- through the Corning Museum of Glass upstate . Also , poised around the room are copper pots from Lebanon and Saudi Arabia -- handed down by Conklin 's mother . To say that it serves purely Lebanese or Middle Eastern food would be to oversimplify . The emphasis is on seasonal ingredients and honouring the integrity of the flavours .

The Ganesh Temple , as it 's colloquially known , opened in 1970 ( with the current building dating from 1977 ) . Its official name is the Hindu Temple Society of North America , because when founded in 1970 it was the first and only traditional Hindu temple in the country .

There are 17 variations of dosas , and an additional four varieties available only on weekends .

You 'll get through . <p> People who do n't think of themselves as gamers , who want to say that the thing they like , because it 's just growing flowers or popping bubbles or carding the wool of a flock of tiny sheep , ca n't really be a game . \" Oh , I do n't really play games , I 'm just super into this flock of tiny sheep right now , look , I just got my first Brecknock Hill Cheviot ! \" Well , if you 're playing that game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting to be associated with a hobby you enjoy .

They often suggest that games must have rules . Or points . Or levels . Or win-states . They want games to seem simple and easily packaged -- for it to seem that there is a clear definition and they are the ones who know it -- because they want to sell their expertise to companies in the form of \" gamification \" . <p> This is that thing where your supermarket tries to encourage you to get to the next \" level \" in orange juice consumption and websites now have a \" percentage complete \" indicator to try to get you to give them more of your personal data .

As a game designer , I suppose I could start from a broadly accepted view of \" what a game is \" .

Those efforts -- along with stockpiled ammunition and bombs -- have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CNN quoted one US official as saying Malik had pledged allegiance to self-appointed Isis caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a Facebook post on the day of the San Bernardino attack , under an account that used a different name . <p> But at the moment we do n't know if the post was simply an expression of approval or praise for the Islamic State 's leader or activities , or a full pledge of allegiance , a bayat . <p> The bayat is an oath taken by an individual to obey the authority of another person , not a group and the term is mostly used when the leader of a faction pledges allegiance to the leader of a bigger organisation . One example earlier this year was when Abou Bakr Shekau , the leader of Nigeria 's Boko Haram militant group declared his loyalty to Baghdadi . <p> Such pledges are sometimes solicited -- Isis has been making significant efforts to win over factions -- and sometimes unsolicited : for the past 18 months , Isis has been making calls for individuals in the west to strike locally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of so-called \" lone wolf \" attackers in the west have claimed to be linked to Isis ; but while some of those claims have been endorsed by the organisation , others have gone ignored . <p> One attack that Isis claimed as its own -- even if it appears the group had no role whatsoever in its planning and execution -- was the siege in January at a kosher supermarket in Paris . Amedy Coulibaly , a convicted bank robber who coordinated his attacks with those launched on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by two other militants , claimed in a video recorded shortly before the operation that he had pledged allegiance to Baghdadi , and thus to the Islamic State , in the summer of 2014 . <p> He was shot dead by police in the attack but his wife , Hayat Boumedienne , surfaced weeks later in Syria , featured in the Isis magazine Dabiq . <p> The attacks in Paris earlier this month which left 130 dead appear to have been much more closely controlled by the organisation , though again , details are unclear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in Syria . <p> We know that Isis likes to create ambiguity , anxiety and uncertainty .

"text": "<p> The survival of seabirds including puffins and kittiwakes on St Kilda -- the island archipelago home to one of the world 's most important seabird populations -- is being threatened by climate change , striking new evidence shows . <p> Naturalists have discovered that the kittiwake , a small migratory gull with ink-black wing tips , is on the brink of disappearing from St Kilda . The remote cluster of Scottish islands in the eastern Atlantic is the UK 's only place with two Unesco world heritage site listings -- for its culture and natural history -- and one of only 24 sites with a dual listing worldwide . <p> The kittiwake did not breed in St Kilda this season , with just one chick born there this year after a 99% decrease in occupied nests since the 1990s . Its adult population has since halved . The number of fulmar chicks has plunged by 33% since 2005 , while St Kilda 's puffin population is in persistent decline . <p> \" This data from St Kilda is really extremely worrying , \" said Dr Paul Walton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Society for the Protection of Birds . \" We are losing whole colonies of these birds now and it 's a very serious issue . Frankly , it breaks my heart , it really does . \" <p> With crucial UN climate talks approaching their halfway point in Paris , the data underscored the case for urgent action on climate change , he said . Capping the growth in global temperatures at 2C -- the target for policymakers -- could be enough to allow the marine environment to adapt over time , Walton added . <p> \" There 's a very strong climate change link here that needs to go straight to Paris : what they decide there is going to determine the future of our seabirds , \" he said . \" We are clear on what the science is saying , that really big ecology effects of climate change are unfolding in the marine environment around Scotland right now . It 's not coming , it 's here now . \" <p> St Kilda -- now regarded as one of the world 's most significant bird sanctuaries -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs and poetry heavily featured the seabirds they subsisted on before moving off the archipelago in 1930 . <p> A fulmar chick inside a prehistoric building in Glen bay . Photograph : Murdo Macleod for the Guardian <p> It lies about 41 miles ( 66km ) west of the Hebrides . When bird populations are at their highest , about 1 million birds perch on the island 's high , precipitous cliffs , sea stacs and rocky crags , hosting the world 's largest gannet colony and nearly a third of the charismatic Atlantic puffins that live around the UK and Ireland . <p> In 1987 , the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) counted 7,829 kittiwakes on the islands . Now that number stands at 3,886 . When routine monitoring began 21 years ago , there were 513 occupied kittiwake nests there , with 56 chicks born . This year , researchers found just four nests , a 99.2% decrease , and a single chick . <p> The number of fulmar nests has declined by 37% since 2002 , with productivity rates well below normal levels , averaging 0.28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puffin numbers are also struggling . At 0.59 chicks per burrow , the NTS says puffin breeding is \" still below the long-term average and , set against the longtime scale of the decline , suggests conditions are becoming less suitable for breeding \" . <p> Susan Bain , who manages the island for the NTS , has ruled out windfarms and overfishing as other causes for the birds ' decline . Studies of dead kittiwakes found they had not been eating their normal diet , suggesting fish had moved to follow the cooler waters . <p> Lighter and more buoyant than their neighbouring gannets , the birds struggled to dive to the necessary depths . As a result , dead chicks were found having digested non-nutritious pipefish . <p> \" We 're seeing significant declines in the number of species , which suggests that there 's something changing in the seas , \" Bain said . \" We know the sea temperature is getting warmer , so the fish are moving or are at greater depths . \" <p> Bain says the headline figures are worrying , given the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its Unesco status , yet . \" At the moment , no , I 'm not worried , but I would n't want to be complacent about that either , \" she said . \" If these declines continue , then maybe . \" <p> Regular , long-term visitors had noticed the kittiwake 's absence , she added . \" We were seeing a couple of hundred nests around the village bay in the past . Now there are four , which is devastating . It 's very noticeable . They 're statistically extinct , although we will continue to look for them next year . <p> \" It is normally a noisy place .

"lower_text": "<p> the survival of seabirds including puffins and kittiwakes on st kilda -- the island archipelago home to one of the world 's most important seabird populations -- is being threatened by climate change , striking new evidence shows . <p> naturalists have discovered that the kittiwake , a small migratory gull with ink-black wing tips , is on the brink of disappearing from st kilda . the remote cluster of scottish islands in the eastern atlantic is the uk 's only place with two unesco world heritage site listings -- for its culture and natural history -- and one of only 24 sites with a dual listing worldwide . <p> the kittiwake did not breed in st kilda this season , with just one chick born there this year after a 99% decrease in occupied nests since the 1990s . its adult population has since halved . the number of fulmar chicks has plunged by 33% since 2005 , while st kilda 's puffin population is in persistent decline . <p> \" this data from st kilda is really extremely worrying , \" said dr paul walton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal society for the protection of birds . \" we are losing whole colonies of these birds now and it 's a very serious issue . frankly , it breaks my heart , it really does . \" <p> with crucial un climate talks approaching their halfway point in paris , the data underscored the case for urgent action on climate change , he said . capping the growth in global temperatures at 2c -- the target for policymakers -- could be enough to allow the marine environment to adapt over time , walton added . <p> \" there 's a very strong climate change link here that needs to go straight to paris : what they decide there is going to determine the future of our seabirds , \" he said . \" we are clear on what the science is saying , that really big ecology effects of climate change are unfolding in the marine environment around scotland right now . it 's not coming , it 's here now . \" <p> st kilda -- now regarded as one of the world 's most significant bird sanctuaries -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs and poetry heavily featured the seabirds they subsisted on before moving off the archipelago in 1930 . <p> a fulmar chick inside a prehistoric building in glen bay . photograph : murdo macleod for the guardian <p> it lies about 41 miles ( 66km ) west of the hebrides . when bird populations are at their highest , about 1 million birds perch on the island 's high , precipitous cliffs , sea stacs and rocky crags , hosting the world 's largest gannet colony and nearly a third of the charismatic atlantic puffins that live around the uk and ireland . <p> in 1987 , the national trust for scotland ( nts ) counted 7,829 kittiwakes on the islands . now that number stands at 3,886 . when routine monitoring began 21 years ago , there were 513 occupied kittiwake nests there , with 56 chicks born . this year , researchers found just four nests , a 99.2% decrease , and a single chick . <p> the number of fulmar nests has declined by 37% since 2002 , with productivity rates well below normal levels , averaging 0.28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffin numbers are also struggling . at 0.59 chicks per burrow , the nts says puffin breeding is \" still below the long-term average and , set against the longtime scale of the decline , suggests conditions are becoming less suitable for breeding \" . <p> susan bain , who manages the island for the nts , has ruled out windfarms and overfishing as other causes for the birds ' decline . studies of dead kittiwakes found they had not been eating their normal diet , suggesting fish had moved to follow the cooler waters . <p> lighter and more buoyant than their neighbouring gannets , the birds struggled to dive to the necessary depths . as a result , dead chicks were found having digested non-nutritious pipefish . <p> \" we 're seeing significant declines in the number of species , which suggests that there 's something changing in the seas , \" bain said . \" we know the sea temperature is getting warmer , so the fish are moving or are at greater depths . \" <p> bain says the headline figures are worrying , given the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its unesco status , yet . \" at the moment , no , i 'm not worried , but i would n't want to be complacent about that either , \" she said . \" if these declines continue , then maybe . \" <p> regular , long-term visitors had noticed the kittiwake 's absence , she added . \" we were seeing a couple of hundred nests around the village bay in the past . now there are four , which is devastating . it 's very noticeable . they 're statistically extinct , although we will continue to look for them next year . <p> \" it is normally a noisy place . you walk up to the cliffs and put your head over and it 's constant noise of fulmars , guillemots and razorbills . when they leave and go out to sea it 's silent , you really do notice . it would change the nature of the place significantly if that soundtrack was gone . \" "

As the technology inside data centres continues to change , so must the associated personnel . \" <p> But where to start ? Computing 's research also showed that server virtualisation has been easily the leading consequential technology trend affecting the industry - selected as such by 57 per cent of those surveyed . However , many companies are approaching full server virtualisation and are moving to virtualise other areas of infrastructure and to outsource commodity services . <p> We consulted Rode again on this , asking how the jobs market can react to this trend , and what IT leaders can do to ensure they have a workforce to address it . <p> \" IT leaders want to hire people that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting relevant trends that will benefit their organisation , \" Rode told us . <p> \" As trends grow , it can get harder to find candidates who have simply ' done the same thing ' for another organisation , and IT leaders need to ensure their existing workforce is continually developed and challenged to deliver the right level of value to their business . \" <p> The most important skillset considered by those running a traditional data centre , a highly virtualised one or even a software-defined data centre remains \" an understanding of technology \" .

We attacked in waves and used the flanks well . In spells we looked good enough to win the league , but no team that weak on crosses wins the league . <p> It was clear from the pre-season games it was a weakness and it has n't been addressed . Tim Howard gets a bit pinned to his line on corners and no one really dominates the area for us . <p> Overall it was an exciting game that was great to watch and in Lukaku we have a forward of the highest calibre that could be as unplayable as Suarez was for Liverpool if he keeps up his progression . <p> I am a big fan of Mirallas . He has a real will to win and a lot of ability . I think his time may come towards the end of the season , the balance up front at the minute is working well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent option to change tack in a game as is Naismith . <p> Mirallas ' time will come <p> I would keep him and try to get him on for Kone a bit more as Kone flags in the second half . <h> Should Leighton Baines go straight back into the starting XI now ? <p> Yes , Galloway has proved he will make it as a Premier League defender , but it is clear to me that he is a centre back . I think it is easy to forget the attacking impetus Baines offers . <p> Baines deserves to come straight back in <p> He put one ball into Lukaku on Monday from the left back position that nearly created a goal . Baines has also been loyal to the club and deserves his place when fully fit .

We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think we could have a special team if we hang on to the players . <p> When teams try to play expansively against us we have a formidable counter attack . Teams really got on to it after performances like Wolfsburg last term , but this season they seem to be letting us do it again . <p> Everton 's counter attack is lethal <p> I think we are a bigger club than just getting credit for beating a good team , so it does not bother me too much that it seems to have been forgotten . <h> What 's your take on Everton 's set piece woes ? <p> Attacking corners are a real mystery to me . Mori looks good in the air , Stones ' header against Man Utd was brilliant . Kone and Lukaku are both good in the air . The balls going in are from Barkley or Deulofeu usually , sometimes Barry , and they all have good delivery . <p> Ross Barkley and John Stones ( Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images ) <p> I just do n't think we put much value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit nastier in the box . <p> Defensive corners I would put down to Howard some of the time as he is not commanding but I think the manager just does not place much stock in set piece work . <h> Anything else to add ? <p> I think the club is playing the best football I have seen in my time going the match . Martinez will get it right in the long run . <p> We could nick fourth spot if we keep playing positively , some of the fans get so down on the players so quickly now , they need to take a breath and realise what it was like under Walter Smith or worse Mike Walker !

"text": "<h> Alistair Fraser offers an essential cultural guide to Zagreb , a city with chic caf ? s , curious museums and a stunning cemetery . <p> Old Zagreb is so compact you can reach most of its cultural jewels on foot . Numerous museums and galleries , plus dozens of caf ? s and restaurants , are just yards apart in the Lower Town -- a grid of handsome buildings and parks reflecting the city 's standing in the Austro-Hungarian empire -- and in the cobbled streets of the hilly Upper Town . But with so much choice in Croatia 's capital you need to be selective . <p> Many will feel compelled to visit Mimara , the city 's famous art museum , but to me it is no different from many other great museums and I felt my time would be better spent at the Museum of Contemporary Art . This striking building -- in the otherwise bleak New Zagreb south of the River Sava -- is best visited at night , when it 's lit by fantastic light shows . <p> If Modernism 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where among the narrow streets and magnificent buildings , you 'll find the Museum of Zagreb ( www.mdc.hr/mgz ) . I spent a couple of hours here absorbed in the city 's history , from the Iron Age and its growth as a trading centre to the turbulence of the communist era and the break-up of Yugoslavia . <p> Then I wandered past colourful St Mark 's Church to check out the zany Museum of Broken Relationships ( www.brokenships.com ) . Its collection of objects -- among them an axe , prosthetic leg and wedding dress -- has been donated by individuals . They 're all legacies of failed love affairs and many are accompanied by moving tales of broken hearts . <p> I felt like a drink after that , as my attic is stuffed with many such objects , so I cut across to Tkalciceva , lined with coffee shops and bars , and found Cica , a lively place where I joined the locals knocking back homemade rakija ( fruit-based brandies ) . <p> Did you know ? <p> The fountain pen was invented by Zagreb resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I strolled around Bogoviceva and Preradoviceva square in the Lower Town , where seemingly everyone gathers at one of the many pavement caf ? s , especially Bulldog XL . If you want to mix with the beautiful set , tiny but trendy Eli 's Caff ? and the hip Velvet are the places to be . <p> For music , time your visit to coincide with one of the festivals -- in June there is C'est is d'Best and Croatia 's main event , InMusic , though live acts are easy to find year-round . Among the best venues are the B P Club ( Teslina ) and Bacchus ( Trg kralja Tomislava ) , a friendly jazz bar full of antique curios . <p> To blow away the cobwebs the following morning , I caught the 106 bus to visit Mirogoj , the city 's beautifully landscaped main graveyard .

"lower_text": "<h> alistair fraser offers an essential cultural guide to zagreb , a city with chic caf ? s , curious museums and a stunning cemetery . <p> old zagreb is so compact you can reach most of its cultural jewels on foot . numerous museums and galleries , plus dozens of caf ? s and restaurants , are just yards apart in the lower town -- a grid of handsome buildings and parks reflecting the city 's standing in the austro-hungarian empire -- and in the cobbled streets of the hilly upper town . but with so much choice in croatia 's capital you need to be selective . <p> many will feel compelled to visit mimara , the city 's famous art museum , but to me it is no different from many other great museums and i felt my time would be better spent at the museum of contemporary art . this striking building -- in the otherwise bleak new zagreb south of the river sava -- is best visited at night , when it 's lit by fantastic light shows . <p> if modernism 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where among the narrow streets and magnificent buildings , you 'll find the museum of zagreb ( www.mdc.hr/mgz ) . i spent a couple of hours here absorbed in the city 's history , from the iron age and its growth as a trading centre to the turbulence of the communist era and the break-up of yugoslavia . <p> then i wandered past colourful st mark 's church to check out the zany museum of broken relationships ( www.brokenships.com ) . its collection of objects -- among them an axe , prosthetic leg and wedding dress -- has been donated by individuals . they 're all legacies of failed love affairs and many are accompanied by moving tales of broken hearts . <p> i felt like a drink after that , as my attic is stuffed with many such objects , so i cut across to tkalciceva , lined with coffee shops and bars , and found cica , a lively place where i joined the locals knocking back homemade rakija ( fruit-based brandies ) . <p> did you know ? <p> the fountain pen was invented by zagreb resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i strolled around bogoviceva and preradoviceva square in the lower town , where seemingly everyone gathers at one of the many pavement caf ? s , especially bulldog xl . if you want to mix with the beautiful set , tiny but trendy eli 's caff ? and the hip velvet are the places to be . <p> for music , time your visit to coincide with one of the festivals -- in june there is c'est is d'best and croatia 's main event , inmusic , though live acts are easy to find year-round . among the best venues are the b p club ( teslina ) and bacchus ( trg kralja tomislava ) , a friendly jazz bar full of antique curios . <p> to blow away the cobwebs the following morning , i caught the 106 bus to visit mirogoj , the city 's beautifully landscaped main graveyard . its arcades , ivy-covered cupolas and church are stunning , as are many of the tombstone monuments , in an all-embracing cemetery where you 'll see catholic graves , cyrillic inscriptions of the orthodox church , islamic crescents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomp around zagreb , it was the perfect place to wind down .

His chances of winning a monument , a task that has eluded him in his 18-year career , are receding fast . So what ' s still motivating the nicest guy in the peloton ? <p> This charming man : George Hincapie is one of the most experienced and respected figures in the pelotonPhoto : TIM DE WAELE <p> Hincapie is an old guy in a youngster 's sport . Stand him next to Taylor Phinney , touted as the USA 's brightest young classics talent , as they did at the launch of BMC Racing and the contrast could n't be stronger . Hincapie 's face is lined and his legs are gnarly from a couple of decades at the hands of soigneurs , while 20 year-old Phinney is fresh-faced and smooth skinned . More or less , this pair of tall Americans spans the full age range of the peloton . <p> There are few riders with Hincapie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France team eight times : seven with Lance Armstrong and again with Alberto Contador in 2007 . He has only abandoned the race once -- his first attempt in 1995 . <p> If he completes the Tour in 2012 as he plans to , he will surpass Joop Zoetemelk 's record of 16 appearances . <p> Individual success in the Tour has been rare but in 2005 he scored a spectacular win on the queen stage to Pla d'Adet in the Pyrenees . It led to his erstwhile leader , Armstrong , calling him \" my biggest guy \" . <p> The following year , Hincapie wore the yellow jersey for the first and only time . <h> Related Articles <p> Out of this experience emerges his standing and popularity among other riders . After nearly two decades inside the bubble of professional cycling , he 's managed to remain a popular face with experienced riders and newcomers alike . <p> \" I do n't try to make enemies , \" said Hincapie , \" but if someone crosses me , then I definitely don ' t go out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mild strategy and one that 's led to suggestions he 's not tough enough to win more races but it has contributed to his longevity in a backbiting environment . <p> Phinney , who 's still to be blooded in the pro peloton , is sure of his road captain 's status among riders : \" Everybody you ask is going to tell you that he 's the nicest guy in the world . \" <p> He 's right -- that ' s exactly what riders say . <p> Hincapie says the high points of his career have been to be part of Tour-winning teams but the cobbled classics are where the softly spoken New York native has emerged as more than the loyal helper . He 's won Ghent-Wevelgem and Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne . But the monument he covets above all , Paris-Roubaix , has eluded him . Bad luck and circumstances beyond his control have his peppered his career . In 2006 , his steerer tube snapped while he was riding with what appeared to be winning form . The image of Hincapie sitting forlornly by his bike on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hincapie turned pro with Motorola in 1994 and according to Jim Ochowicz , who ran the team initially , he considered himself a sprinter . <p> He quickly found his niche in the classics , recalls Frankie Andreu , already an established sprinter on the team at the time . The pair rode together until the end of the 1996 season , when Andreu moved to Cofidis . <p> Andreu would later claim under oath that in 2005 , he had heard Armstrong talk to doctors treating him for cancer about taking erythropoietin ( EPO ) as a performance enhancer . But , from the beginning , Hincapie was always a popular , if rather straight-laced , member of the team , says Andreu : \" He was a super-nice guy . He was young and motivated . Cycling was his life and he fitted into the team well . It sounds corny but he was a well-mannered , good kid from good parents . \" <p> If there 's an illustration that cycling is his life it 's the fact that he met his French wife , Melanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tour de France and the pair now have two children . <p> Despite being young and quiet , his passion for the cobbles was evident from the start : \" Doing the classics for a first or second year guy can be overwhelming but he loved it . He loved the fight , the grit , the dirt , \" recalls Andreu . <p> His first three attempts at Paris-Roubaix , between 1995 and 1997 , did n't foretell of the consistency he would later achieve in the race as he did n't finish higher than 21st . But in 1999 he came fourth and a remarkable record began . Apart from two missed editions and the abandonment in 2006 due to the steerer tube incident , he never finished outside the top ten again until 2009 . <p> With the results came responsibility . <p> \" He was n't a leader that dictated , \" says Andreu . \" He was quiet but he let his legs do the talking . If you end up in the first group every time , you don ' t need to tell people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it got . For all his ability , a victory in Paris-Roubaix or Flanders still eludes him . That slice of luck which is said to be crucial to a victory has been missing . <p> \" I do n't know if it worries him , \" continues Andreu , \" but it 's a thorn in his side . I think it 's something he always wanted to achieve . All the pressure from his fans and because everybody keeps talking about it -- I think that weighs on him a lot . \" <p> It could have been different . During that series of top tens , Andreu says Hincapie should have focused on those first two weekends in the April , the same way Armstrong did on the Tour . To do so would have meant leaving the familiarity of US Postal and its latter incarnation , Team Discovery -- and that would n't have suited his nature , believes Andreu . <p> \" George likes to be comfortable . He had a couple of chances to join a couple of incredible classics teams and if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic , it was a mistake not changing teams . But with his personality , I think it would have been difficult for him . He likes knowing what to expect . \" <p> Hincapie himself recognises his chances of winning Flanders or Roubaix -- or any of the other classic for that matter -- are disappearing . He will need to get lucky . At BMC , he 's not the undisputed leader . Alessandro Ballan is back , having been ruled out of last year 's spring classics through a team suspension while an Italian doping investigation ran its course , and the team is packed with strong classics riders . <p> \" The road will decide who is leader at the classics , absolutely , \" says Hincapie . \" We 'll see how Taylor Phinney adapts to the distance but he could be a very good player in our team as well as Greg Van Avermaet , Karsten Kroon , Marcus Burghardt -- all these guys have been top ten in one of the classics . So for me , I 'm just excited about being on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best guy , then that means I 'll have a great chance of winning the race with those guys behind me . Or if they 're better than me , I 'll be just as excited . \" <p> That willingness to forego his own ambitions has made Hincapie a valuable team-mate to successive Tour leaders . He was Armstrong 's most loyal ally and instrumental in helping Mark Cavendish win 10 stages of the race in 2008 and 2009 . It 's as a domestique de luxe where he has carved out a niche for himself . <p> \" I still feel really good , \" said Hincapie at the team launch in January . \" For some reason I still feel better than ever and that ' s a good sign for me . And I know as I get older my chances for winning races are less and less but I can still help my team-mates better than most people in the peloton . For me to win a stage , I know that I 've got to get in a lucky break and , if that happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d be wonderful but I know my main priority will be to help Cadel Evans make the podium or better . \" <p> Perhaps his greatest achievement on the bike was his win on the queen stage of the 2005 Tour de France which helped haul him to 14th in the final general classification . But it was in the blue-and-white US Postal Service livery that he became most famous as an ultra-reliable domestique , shepherding Armstrong to successive victories in the Tour and picking up individual wins in stage races such as the Dauphin ? Lib ? r ? , the Tour of Catalonia and the Tour of California . <p> That team 's prolific success is currently under intense scrutiny by American authorities probing the inner workings of US Postal and whether it hid systematic use of performance enhancing drugs to help Armstrong win the Tour . In 2010 , reports suggested Hincapie had been contacted by the federal agents investigating but it is n't a subject Hincapie will comment on , preferring to trot out an answer about how much the sport is doing to weed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to win cleanly . <p> He was once inextricably linked with the fortunes of Armstrong and , upon the Texan 's comeback , described him as a brother . Yet they have n't spoken lately -- because of the arrival of Armstrong 's latest baby , insists Hincapie . <p> At the end of 2007 and after eight seasons of servicing the Tour ambitions of general classification contenders , Hincapie left the Discovery team and Johan Bruyneel for HTC-Highroad where he would stay for two seasons and emerge as a guiding light for young riders . <p> \" t that point , I felt I wanted a change , I wanted to see what else was out there , \" reflects Hincapie . \" I needed a different type of stimulation , a different type of environment . I felt like I was just getting bored there . \" <p> That new environment was focused on Mark Cavendish and Hincapie soon became an instrumental part of his lead-out train as well as a font of knowledge and experience . Hincapie almost secured his second stint in the yellow jersey too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the time gap he needed . <p> Ochowicz spoke to Hincapie a few days after the event . \" I spoke to him some days later . It was probably a bit too emotional afterwards for strangers to be sticking their noses in there but it obviously it was a disappointment . \" <p> It was more than that . The wilful intent to frustrate Hincapie -- the quiet , nice guy -- hardened his popularity with fans and riders . And , for once , proof emerged that still waters run deep . \" I was angry , definitely very angry about it . I was just caught in the middle of an attention battle between two American teams . It was very unfortunate for me but has it changed me ? No , not really . \" <p> When the American left at the end of 2009 , Cavendish paid homage : \" George has been an instrumental part of my success and my career and I 'm really sad to not race with him any more . He 's been like a big brother to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . He 's such a big , big part of the team . He 's like the granddaddy of the team , he looks after everyone . \" <p> In a piece of neat symmetry , Hincapie has wound up as the road captain at BMC Racing , under the control of Jim Ochowicz again . Hincapie said he was attracted by the squad 's ambitiousness . Where once it was riders such as Phil Anderson taking Hincapie under his wing , he 's now fulfilling that same role for others , including Chris Butler , his training partner when they are at home in South Carolina , and Taylor Phinney . <p> \" You could say he planted the initial seed about joining BMC in my head , \" says Phinney . \" Last year , I went and stayed right next to his house in Girona for a bit last season and went out for a couple of rides with him . He 's just such a nice guy . He 's quiet but at the same time , he 's a leader and , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that ' s unprofessional . \" <p> That role as guide has developed naturally and will probably spill over into retirement . <p> He still plans to be involved with BMC in some capacity , either through his brand of sportswear for the team or as an advisor . \" The mentoring role in the team is not something I looked for , it just sort of came because of how long I 've been riding and the respect that I 've gained in the peloton . <p> \" At moments like when I crashed twice in 200m last year , you think : ' What am I doing ? ' but then you think how great the sport is . I feel I 'm lucky to have been around so long , I 've been able to make a good life out of it , I met my wife through the sport , I ' ve made a lot of friends and relationships that I would n't trade for anything , so the sport 's given a lot to me and I 'm not ready to leave it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's success as being his quiet , diplomatic persona . \" He just rode his bike and never got into trouble -- he never went off partying or crashing cars or doing anything stupid like some other guys . That 's not his personality and it 's been key to his longevity in the peloton and the respect other riders have for him . There are a lot of riders out there who are strong but assholes , and nobody wants to have anything to do with them . George is the opposite of that . \" <p> Will he win the monument that he 's chased so ardently ? Probably not . But as the capacity to follow the moves of riders 10 to 15 years younger diminishes , it 's replaced with a fatherly sense of responsibility towards the young riders around him . And he 's happy with that . ",

one of the classics . so for me , i 'm just excited about being on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best guy , then that means i 'll have a great chance of winning the race with those guys behind me . or if they 're better than me , i 'll be just as excited . \" <p> that willingness to forego his own ambitions has made hincapie a valuable team-mate to successive tour leaders . he was armstrong 's most loyal ally and instrumental in helping mark cavendish win 10 stages of the race in 2008 and 2009 . it 's as a domestique de luxe where he has carved out a niche for himself . <p> \" i still feel really good , \" said hincapie at the team launch in january . \" for some reason i still feel better than ever and that ' s a good sign for me . and i know as i get older my chances for winning races are less and less but i can still help my team-mates better than most people in the peloton . for me to win a stage , i know that i 've got to get in a lucky break and , if that happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d be wonderful but i know my main priority will be to help cadel evans make the podium or better . \" <p> perhaps his greatest achievement on the bike was his win on the queen stage of the 2005 tour de france which helped haul him to 14th in the final general classification . but it was in the blue-and-white us postal service livery that he became most famous as an ultra-reliable domestique , shepherding armstrong to successive victories in the tour and picking up individual wins in stage races such as the dauphin ? lib ? r ? , the tour of catalonia and the tour of california . <p> that team 's prolific success is currently under intense scrutiny by american authorities probing the inner workings of us postal and whether it hid systematic use of performance enhancing drugs to help armstrong win the tour . in 2010 , reports suggested hincapie had been contacted by the federal agents investigating but it is n't a subject hincapie will comment on , preferring to trot out an answer about how much the sport is doing to weed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to win cleanly . <p> he was once inextricably linked with the fortunes of armstrong and , upon the texan 's comeback , described him as a brother . yet they have n't spoken lately -- because of the arrival of armstrong 's latest baby , insists hincapie . <p> at the end of 2007 and after eight seasons of servicing the tour ambitions of general classification contenders , hincapie left the discovery team and johan bruyneel for htc-highroad where he would stay for two seasons and emerge as a guiding light for young riders . <p> \" t that point , i felt i wanted a change , i wanted to see what else was out there , \" reflects hincapie . \" i needed a different type of stimulation , a different type of environment . i felt like i was just getting bored there . \" <p> that new environment was focused on mark cavendish and hincapie soon became an instrumental part of his lead-out train as well as a font of knowledge and experience . hincapie almost secured his second stint in the yellow jersey too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the time gap he needed . <p> ochowicz spoke to hincapie a few days after the event . \" i spoke to him some days later . it was probably a bit too emotional afterwards for strangers to be sticking their noses in there but it obviously it was a disappointment . \" <p> it was more than that . the wilful intent to frustrate hincapie -- the quiet , nice guy -- hardened his popularity with fans and riders . and , for once , proof emerged that still waters run deep . \" i was angry , definitely very angry about it . i was just caught in the middle of an attention battle between two american teams . it was very unfortunate for me but has it changed me ? no , not really . \" <p> when the american left at the end of 2009 , cavendish paid homage : \" george has been an instrumental part of my success and my career and i 'm really sad to not race with him any more . he 's been like a big brother to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . he 's such a big , big part of the team . he 's like the granddaddy of the team , he looks after everyone . \" <p> in a piece of neat symmetry , hincapie has wound up as the road captain at bmc racing , under the control of jim ochowicz again . hincapie said he was attracted by the squad 's ambitiousness . where once it was riders such as phil anderson taking hincapie under his wing , he 's now fulfilling that same role for others , including chris butler , his training partner when they are at home in south carolina , and taylor phinney . <p> \" you could say he planted the initial seed about joining bmc in my head , \" says phinney . \" last year , i went and stayed right next to his house in girona for a bit last season and went out for a couple of rides with him . he 's just such a nice guy . he 's quiet but at the same time , he 's a leader and , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that ' s unprofessional . \" <p> that role as guide has developed naturally and will probably spill over into retirement . <p> he still plans to be involved with bmc in some capacity , either through his brand of sportswear for the team or as an advisor . \" the mentoring role in the team is not something i looked for , it just sort of came because of how long i 've been riding and the respect that i 've gained in the peloton . <p> \" at moments like when i crashed twice in 200m last year , you think : ' what am i doing ? ' but then you think how great the sport is . i feel i 'm lucky to have been around so long , i 've been able to make a good life out of it , i met my wife through the sport , i ' ve made a lot of friends and relationships that i would n't trade for anything , so the sport 's given a lot to me and i 'm not ready to leave it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's success as being his quiet , diplomatic persona . \" he just rode his bike and never got into trouble -- he never went off partying or crashing cars or doing anything stupid like some other guys . that 's not his personality and it 's been key to his longevity in the peloton and the respect other riders have for him . there are a lot of riders out there who are strong but assholes , and nobody wants to have anything to do with them . george is the opposite of that . \" <p> will he win the monument that he 's chased so ardently ? probably not . but as the capacity to follow the moves of riders 10 to 15 years younger diminishes , it 's replaced with a fatherly sense of responsibility towards the young riders around him . and he 's happy with that .

"title": "Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire: hotel review\n",
"text": "<p> Fiona Duncan , Telegraph Travel 's hotel expert , reviews the best and worst of Britain 's hotels and bed and breakfasts , from boutique to budget , countryside to city centre . Follow Fiona on Twitter : @HotelGuruGuru . <p> Actually it 's not Brocket Hall . It 's Melbourne Lodge . It could be Brocket Hall , but only on certain nights . <p> Let me explain before I lose you completely . When Charles Brocket was famously jailed in 1996 for drowning his Ferraris in the lake as an insurance fraud , his estate , which by that time included two golf courses and a restaurant , was repossessed by the bank and sold on a long lease to an Asia-based hotel management company . <p> The 30-bedroom Hall itself , one of England 's most notable stately homes , with glorious interiors and a scandalous history ( it was the home of Byron 's infatuated lover , Lady Caroline Lamb , and the scene of octogenarian Lord Palmerston 's sudden demise while in flagrante on the billiard table with a chambermaid ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel . The estate 's hotel is Melbourne Lodge , fashioned from the old stables , with 16 rooms . <p> One longs , of course , for the hotel to be the Hall . The rooms in the stables are lovely , as well as affordable , but the Hall is a truly magical place , unchanged since Brocket 's departure , with family photographs , superb furniture that includes the second-longest dining table in the country and walls hung with important pictures . It 's a surprise and a delight , but only for those who can get inside . <p> And if you are staying at Melbourne Lodge , you ca n't get inside . You can be a guest member of the golf club , wander around the parkland , centred on romantic Broadwater Lake , with its swans and bridge and weeping willows , and take advantage of the exquisite cooking of Michelin-starred Phil Thompson in his Auberge du Lac ( and his equally accomplished breakfasts in the clubhouse ) but there remains a palpable sense of being cut off from the main action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its gracious , classical bedrooms suggest , there surely needs to be a welcoming reception in the building , instead of collecting your key from the golf club and walking alone up the hill to find your room . <p> Improvements are being made : limited room service has been introduced , and complimentary newspapers delivered to the door , but the present arrangement makes it very difficult for non-golfing guests to feel the privilege of being part of a private , timeless , historic estate . <p> Until , that is , they stroll to the Auberge du Lac , a charming , diminutive former hunting lodge with a waterfront terrace and stately willows dramatically lit at night . It reminded me of one of my favourite restaurants in France and all through dinner I could n't shake off the feeling that I was back in the Auberge de l'Ill , that venerable , family-owned , three-Michelin-star waterside restaurant in Alsace , which is the best compliment I can give . <p> What do I mean by \" Brocket Hall on certain nights \" ? The innovative new management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" throughout the year when guests can sleep , drink champagne and dine on Thompson 's food and breakfast in the Hall itself , for ? 385 for two . First to book gets the best of the bedrooms upstairs , but all are exceptional . <p> Value for money TTTTT Room prices are very fair ; ' Evenings of Elegance ' , too <p> Access possible for guests with disabilities . <p> Country walks <p> Stanborough Park is 126 acres of countryside park and lakes just outside Welwyn Garden City . With its boating lake , walks , children 's play area , fishing , organised nature trails and more , it 's also ideal for families . For further information on the park and beyond , visit hertfordshire.com . <p> Where to visit <p> Hatfield House ( 01707 287010 ; hatfield-house.co.uk ) , three miles away , is one of the 10 Treasure Houses of England , which means it is an \" architectural masterpiece surrounded by beautiful parklands and gardens \" . The gorgeous Jacobean home of the Cecil family is all that and more , although note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 . <p> Local pubs <p> The Red Lion ( 0871 223 8000 ) at Ayot Green in Welwyn is the best pub around . Or try the charming Brocket Arms ( 01438 820250 ; brocketarms.com ) , a tiny 14th-century pub in Ayot St Lawrence . Its restaurant is presided over by Andrew Knight , who trained under Angela Harnett and Gordon Ramsay . The Beckhams are apparently fans . ",

"text": "<h> William Craig <h> William Craig , who died on April 25 aged 86 , was the leader of the militant Ulster Vanguard movement and was Vanguard Unionist MP for East Belfast from 1973 to 1979 . <p> During the early years of direct rule in the province , Craig earned a reputation as a Protestant firebrand and launched his Vanguard Party in demagogic style , demanding a return to Protestant majority rule in Stormont and no \" sell-out \" to the Roman Catholic minority in the province . <p> William Craig <p> In 1974 Craig was the main organiser with the Rev Ian Paisley of the Loyalist strike which brought down the five-month-old power-sharing assembly on which the British government had pinned so much hope . Craig was regarded as the link with the paramilitary groups , the UDA and the UVF , which gave the strike its muscle . <p> But the next three years saw a dramatic shift in his position . In 1975 he split fellow Unionists over their refusal to continue talks over power sharing with the mainly Catholic SDLP . He condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable effect behind the scenes to prevent the strike closing the crucial Ballylumford power station at Larne and to get Larne harbour reopened . <p> Craig 's change of heart won him little credit in the Unionist community and he promptly lost more than half his followers . After winding up Ulster Vanguard in 1978 , he won the Official Unionist nomination for his constituency , but was defeated at the 1979 general election by the Democratic Unionist Peter Robinson . <p> There was , though , an underlying consistency in Craig 's change of heart : unlike politicians such as Paisley , he had been prepared to negotiate with Roman Catholics provided they shared his belief that Northern Ireland could be governed effectively only by local politicians , either through independence or some form of devolution within the United Kingdom . A strong pro-European , he saw the German federal model as offering the best hope of a lasting solution . <h> Related Articles <p> William Craig was born on December 2 1924 at Cookstown , Co Tyrone , the son of a bank manager , and educated at Dungannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was declared he volunteered for the RAF and served as a rear gunner in Bomber Command . After the war he studied Law at Queen 's University , Belfast , and was articled to a solicitors ' firm , qualifying in 1952 . With a bank loan he bought into a small practice at Lurgan . <p> In 1960 he was returned to the Stormont Parliament as Unionist member for Larne . Appointed chief whip in 1962 , he became Minister for Home Affairs in 1963 , Minister for Health and Local Government in 1964 , Minister for Development in 1965 and Minister for Home Affairs again in 1966 . <p> But as the Unionist leadership , under Captain Terence O'Neill , came under pressure from the British government to respond to Catholic demands for civil rights , Craig became increasingly outspoken in his opposition to any concessions . <p> His biggest political decision during this time was to ban the civil rights march in Londonderry in October 1968 because he believed it was a \" Nationalist/Republican parade \" . The march went ahead , but the police stopped it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals for constitutional reform , Craig was dismissed from the Cabinet in December 1968 . <p> He soon became the focus for grass roots opposition to the Unionist Party leadership , fomenting dissent among the party 's rank and file . After O'Neill 's resignation , he fought both James Chichester Clark and later Brian Faulkner for the Unionist leadership . <p> Craig 's rhetoric during this period became increasingly uncompromising .

"lower_text": "<h> william craig <h> william craig , who died on april 25 aged 86 , was the leader of the militant ulster vanguard movement and was vanguard unionist mp for east belfast from 1973 to 1979 . <p> during the early years of direct rule in the province , craig earned a reputation as a protestant firebrand and launched his vanguard party in demagogic style , demanding a return to protestant majority rule in stormont and no \" sell-out \" to the roman catholic minority in the province . <p> william craig <p> in 1974 craig was the main organiser with the rev ian paisley of the loyalist strike which brought down the five-month-old power-sharing assembly on which the british government had pinned so much hope . craig was regarded as the link with the paramilitary groups , the uda and the uvf , which gave the strike its muscle . <p> but the next three years saw a dramatic shift in his position . in 1975 he split fellow unionists over their refusal to continue talks over power sharing with the mainly catholic sdlp . he condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable effect behind the scenes to prevent the strike closing the crucial ballylumford power station at larne and to get larne harbour reopened . <p> craig 's change of heart won him little credit in the unionist community and he promptly lost more than half his followers . after winding up ulster vanguard in 1978 , he won the official unionist nomination for his constituency , but was defeated at the 1979 general election by the democratic unionist peter robinson . <p> there was , though , an underlying consistency in craig 's change of heart : unlike politicians such as paisley , he had been prepared to negotiate with roman catholics provided they shared his belief that northern ireland could be governed effectively only by local politicians , either through independence or some form of devolution within the united kingdom . a strong pro-european , he saw the german federal model as offering the best hope of a lasting solution . <h> related articles <p> william craig was born on december 2 1924 at cookstown , co tyrone , the son of a bank manager , and educated at dungannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was declared he volunteered for the raf and served as a rear gunner in bomber command . after the war he studied law at queen 's university , belfast , and was articled to a solicitors ' firm , qualifying in 1952 . with a bank loan he bought into a small practice at lurgan . <p> in 1960 he was returned to the stormont parliament as unionist member for larne . appointed chief whip in 1962 , he became minister for home affairs in 1963 , minister for health and local government in 1964 , minister for development in 1965 and minister for home affairs again in 1966 . <p> but as the unionist leadership , under captain terence o'neill , came under pressure from the british government to respond to catholic demands for civil rights , craig became increasingly outspoken in his opposition to any concessions . <p> his biggest political decision during this time was to ban the civil rights march in londonderry in october 1968 because he believed it was a \" nationalist/republican parade \" . the march went ahead , but the police stopped it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals for constitutional reform , craig was dismissed from the cabinet in december 1968 . <p> he soon became the focus for grass roots opposition to the unionist party leadership , fomenting dissent among the party 's rank and file . after o'neill 's resignation , he fought both james chichester clark and later brian faulkner for the unionist leadership . <p> craig 's rhetoric during this period became increasingly uncompromising . in 1969 he prophesied civil war if the government 's proposals to restructure the ulster special constabulary were accepted ; as the prospect of direct rule came nearer , he called on the people of northern ireland to \" use every means to defend their constitutional rights \" . <p> after direct rule was imposed in 1972 , he resigned from the unionist party because it had accepted the government 's white paper proposals on power sharing . in october 1972 he survived an attack by a provisional ira gunman who fired at him while he was driving to his solicitors ' practice at lurgan . <p> soon afterwards he announced that he and his followers were prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ british heritage . <p> craig was the guiding light behind the revival of the ulster loyalist association in 1969 which in 1972 became the vanguard movement , a non-party association of loyalist organisations committed to the preservation of the northern irish constitution . he gathered popular support in a series of rallies , telling his supporters that they should build up dossiers on the \" enemies \" of northern ireland \" because one day , if our politicians fail , we will have to liquidate the enemy \" . <p> ulster vanguard stayed inside the unionist monolith until stormont was prorogued and the northern ireland assembly elections of 1973 , when it was converted into a party . by the time craig entered parliament at the february 1974 general election , however , he was beginning to have second thoughts . <p> as the province teetered on the brink of civil war , he began to recoil from the plans of loyalist paramilitary groups to take control of the province and declare independence . he had also become convinced that some form of coalition with catholics was the only way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 he broke ranks with the united ulster unionist coalition ( uuuc ) in the northern irish constitutional convention over its decision to break off power-sharing talks with the sdlp , and went on to offer the sdlp seats in a national emergency coalition . he had become convinced during the talks that the sdlp was \" prepared to support the state of northern ireland as long as the state has the support of the majority \" . <p> craig 's volte-face was immediately attacked by his fellow unionists , notably ian paisley and enoch powell . the following month , nine out of 13 vanguard colleagues on the constitutional convention resigned , and craig and his followers were expelled from the uuuc . <p> after losing his seat in the 1979 general election , in 1982 craig stood unsuccessfully for election to the devolved northern ireland assembly as the sole representative of a revived vanguard party . <p> despite his erstwhile reputation as a rabble rouser , in private craig was a humorous and tolerant man , able to get on with politicians of every political hue . <p> he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman whom he had met on holiday in majorca . they had two sons .

Discovered earlier by Dmitry Fedotov and Denis Kurta , it was ugly and tortuous , but it opened the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , courtesy of Alexander Klimchouk <p> Bill Stone , half a mile deep and three miles from the entrance in a Mexican supercave called Cheve , did stop . Red-and-white plastic survey tape hung across the narrow passage he had been ascending . The message , scrawled on notebook paper , was affixed to the tape at chest level . Afloat in the cave 's absolute darkness , the white paper burned so brightly in the beam of Stone 's headlamp that it almost hurt his eyes . The time was shortly before midnight on March 1 1991 , though that made no particular difference -- it was always midnight in a cave . <p> Stone , a hard-driving man with a doctorate in structural engineering , stood 6ft 4in tall and weighed 200lb . He was one of the leaders of an expedition trying to make the last great terrestrial discovery by proving that Cheve was the deepest cave on Earth . <p> With three companions , he was halfway through the gruelling , two-day climb back to the surface from the cave 's deepest known point , something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The note and tape had been strung just before the expedition 's Camp Two , where four others were staying . <h> Related Articles <p> They explained to Stone what had happened . At about 1.30pm , a caver from Indiana named Chris Yeager , 25 years old , had entered the cave with an older , more experienced man , Peter Haberland . Yeager had been caving for just two years , and going into Cheve was , for him , like a climber who had been on only small Vermont mountains suddenly tackling Everest . <p> Seriously concerned about the younger man 's safety , a veteran , elite cave explorer named Jim Smith sat Yeager down for what should have been a sobering , 30-minute lecture : do n't go into the cave without a guide , carry only a light daypack at first , learn the route in segments , get \" acclimatised \" to the underground world before going in for a long stay . The warnings fell on deaf ears . Yeager started his first trip with a 55lb pack , planning on a seven-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the top of a cliff that had been named the 23-Metre Drop because it was exactly that , a 75-feet free drop from lip to pit that had to be rappelled . By supercaving standards , where free vertical drops hundreds of feet long are common , this was little more than a hop down . Haberland went first , completing an easy rappel without incident . At the bottom he detached his rappel rack ( a metal device resembling a big paper clip with transverse bars ) from the rope , then moved away to avoid any rocks Yeager might dislodge . <p> Above , Yeager was wearing standard descent equipment , which included a seat harness similar to those used by rock climbers but beefed up for the heavier demands of caving . A locking carabiner ( an aluminium loop , about the size of a pack of cigarettes , with a hinged \" gate \" on one side ) connected the harness to his rappel rack , and the rappel rack connected him to the rope . The rope wove through the rack 's bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder . Before going farther , Yeager had to transfer his rack from the rope he had been descending to a new one . <p> He made the change successfully , leant back to begin his rappel , and realised instantly that something was wrong . The rope did not stop his backward-tilting motion . Instead , he kept going , as if tipping over backward in a chair . Somehow his harness had become separated from the rappel rack , which was still attached to the rope . <p> Instinctively , he lunged to grab the rope and the dangling rappel rack , but his heavy pack made any self-arrest impossible . He fell so quickly that he did n't have time to scream . <p> As the 21st century began , we believed that every one of the Earth 's great discoveries had been made . Almost a century had passed since Peary first trod the North Pole and Amundsen the South . Hillary and Norgay summated Mount Everest in 1953 , Piccard and Walsh dove the deepest ocean in 1960 . Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of discovery were wrong . When the third millennium rolled round , one last great terrestrial discovery did still await : the deepest cave on Earth . <p> The subterranean world remains the greatest geographic unknown on this planet -- called \" the eighth continent \" by some . Mountains , ocean depths , the moon , and even Martian scapes can be -- and have been -- revealed and explored by humans or our robotic surrogates . Not so caves . They are the sole remaining realm that can be experienced only first-hand , by direct human presence . <p> There are also rabid bats , snakes , troglodytic scorpions and spiders , radon , and microbes that cause horrific diseases . Kitum Cave on the Kenya-Uganda border is believed to be the birthplace of the Ebola virus . <p> By the turn of the 21st century , three crucial things had become clear about the last great terrestrial discovery . First , it probably would be made within a decade . Second , it would almost certainly be made in one of two places : the Abkhazia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oaxaca , in southern Mexico . Finally , one of two men would lead the discovery team . They were the Ukrainian Alexander Klimchouk and the American Bill Stone , both of whom had devoted their lives to the search for the bottom of the world . <p> Klimchouk and Stone fit nicely into a list of opposites . Klimchouk is short and slight . Stone is towering and muscular . Klimchouk is quiet , self-effacing , and avuncular . Stone is bold , brash , and commanding . For Stone , science is a means to an end : exploring . He sees himself as a \" pioneer \" who opens new realms where others can follow . For Klimchouk , it is the other way around : science is the end and caves are the laboratories in which he does it . <p> It was in 2004 that the stage was set for an epic race to find the deepest cave on Earth . Even the normally staid National Geographic magazine borrowed a phrase from Jules Verne to describe it : \" The Race to the Centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Mexico , and the Krubera cave , in Georgia , have very little in common . <p> Both are true supercaves , thousands of feet deep and with many miles of surveyed passages , but there the similarities end . Cheve resembles a gigantic L , with an initial shaft dropping about 3,000 feet and an elongated foot descending for almost two more miles at a moderate slope of roughly 10 degrees . Krubera , on the other hand , is 90 per cent vertical , pitch ( a vertical drop ) after pitch connected by short passages called meanders . While non-cavers would be terrorised by the yawning pits , one of which is 500-feet deep , experienced cavers look forward to their thrilling rappels , if not to their grinding ascents . <p> Traversing Krubera 's many meanders is like crawling under your car ( while half submerged in flowing water ) for thousands of yards . The caves ' body temperatures are also different . Cheve is cool but relatively mild , with air temperatures that range from 47 degrees at its entrance to the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Krubera , on the other hand , is freezing , the kind of cold that , when you 're working with water and wind , can quickly put you into third-stage , potentially fatal hypothermia . The inflowing water is never much more than 32 degrees ; unprotected survival time in water that cold is 15 minutes or less . <p> In a supercave every step taken , every knot tied and soup bowl filled and latrine used and map read requires the circle of light from a headlamp or flashlight . Prolonged , absolute darkness has profound effects on the human body and mind . Veteran Texas caver R D Milhollin made his first Cheve entry during a 2003 expedition . Reaching Camp Two , he and his three companions settled in to eat and sleep for a day or two . Wanting to conserve batteries , they kept their lights off except for essential tasks . After not very long , though , they confessed to one another that the cave was doing strange things to their minds . <p> Milhollin was hearing phantom noises and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . They decamped promptly the next morning . <p> Stone had never hesitated to proclaim to the world that Cheve had a proven potential to be the deepest cave in the world , even if it meant spending more than a month underground and diving far enough to effectively separate from the main expedition . He also knew that Krubera had the potential to go just as deep , and that Klimchouk was determined to prove that it did . Stone decided to make his all-out attempt in Mexico in 2004 . His expedition party left Austin , Texas , on February 22 2004 . <p> The general population of supercave explorers breaks down into specialist subtribes : leaders and Sherpas , bolters and ropers and riggers , lead climbers and divers and diggers . Diggers endure hours of confinement in squeezes so tight they can barely breathe and can move only one hand . They dig like giant moles , using tools ranging from their fingernails to hi-tech titanium implements to gasoline-powered hammer drills . <p> Diggers are essential to supercave exploration . It is not unusual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockages are breakdown ( jagged boulders that had broken from the ceiling over aeons and continued to do so unpredictably ) and boulder chokes , but quite often they are not truly terminal . If the cavers can feel air movement coming through a wall of breakdown or boulders , it makes sense to try to find a way through . <p> In March 2004 , John Kerr , one of the world 's greatest diggers and another caver , Bart Hogan , were burrowing down a tunnel in the Aguacate River Sink Cave , which Stone hoped would link to the main Cheve cave . Kerr took the lead with his titanium tool and burrowed 150 feet forward . Hogan , crawling a good distance behind , called to Kerr . <p> No reply . Hogan called again and again , with no response . He was beginning to fear the worst -- that Kerr might have suffocated -- when the other man finally came backing out with frightening news . The tunnel 's ceiling had collapsed on him , burying the length of his body to eye level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , \" he reported calmly . <p> On March 22 , without a major breakthrough , Stone 's team returned to the surface . They had made it no further than 4,869 feet ( 1,484 metres ) deep . Stone vowed to return . He had not proven Cheve to be the deepest cave on Earth . It remained to be seen , halfway around the world , what Klimchouk and his cavers would prove about Krubera in 2004 . <p> Supercaves teach those who explore them any number of things , and scepticism is a big one . The numbers work like this : hundreds of promising leads produce a few dozen explorable passages , which , most often , end in piles of boulders or flooded tunnels or simply blank walls . Once in a great while , an explorable passage will go , and once in an ever-greater while , one will just keep going . But those , the fabulous ones that have no stop in them , are rare . <p> Klimchouk quantified how things had played out over the years . Of hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent yielded more depth and distance ; only one per cent produced substantial breakthroughs . <p> Klimchouk led an expedition to Krubera in August 2004 , paving the way for another effort in October . At that point , he had been in the field for two and a half months . He could not manage another month away from family , university , and laboratory . Someone else would have to lead the next effort . <p> Yury Kasjan was the logical choice . He knew Krubera as well as anyone . Like Klimchouk , Kasjan was a fine leader , quiet but good-natured ; had unbelievable stamina ; and was technically adept at all aspects of extreme caving . <p> Nine cavers would work underground in two separate groups . The first group included Kasjan and Emil Vash , a tall , slender 22-year-old student ; Ekaterina Medvedeva , 23 , Igor Ischenko , 36 , and Kyryl Gostev , 21 , rounded out the team . They would be the expedition 's spearhead . <p> Day by day , like mountaineers climbing up to successively higher camps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On October 11 they occupied the 1,400-Metre Camp . That lowest spot would become this expedition 's jumping-off point . Everything previous was just preparation . <p> To reach that camp , however , they had to get themselves , their gear , and their supplies through a short but treacherous sump . In common usage , a sump is a place , lower than its surroundings , where liquid collects . Sumps in caves are long , winding , flooded tunnels . In places they are so tight that divers have to stop , doff their tanks , push them through , and then follow , donning their equipment again only when the passage widens sufficiently . <p> That description really does not do the procedure justice , though , because you remain connected to your air tanks only by the regulator hose and mouthpiece . It takes not much force at all to yank the mouthpiece from between your teeth , and if that happens , in what is almost certain to be zero visibility , your chances of finding it again before you drown are not so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment was not absolutely essential . But it was long and tight enough to stretch a breath-hold dive to its extreme limits . Because bringing scuba gear involved another whole dimension of logistics , Kasjan had elected to traverse this sump by breath-hold diving . Vash knew he would have to go through if he was to have any chance of reaching Krubera 's bottom . <p> On October 12 , the day of the planned sump crossing , Vash found himself too nervous to eat breakfast . He had been told that the underwater tunnel was about 30 inches high and 10-feet long . What made it so dangerous was that it was just 18 inches wide , roughly the diameter of a large pizza . In addition , its walls were rough and spiked with protrusions that could easily snag a caver . It would not take long to drown in those conditions . <p> He would do well to be able to hold his breath for 60 seconds in water that cold . Throw in the added factors of panic and wild attempts to extricate oneself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a premonition that he would not make it through , but he pushed on regardless . He hyperventilated to blow carbon dioxide out of his system , held a last breath , and dove . His premonition quickly came true . He did n't submerge deeply enough and , halfway through , his helmet caught on a ceiling obstruction . <p> Panicking , he flailed back out of the sump and surfaced , unnerved and gasping . It had been one of the worst moments of his caving career . <p> Though it had taken only 20 seconds or so for Vash to extricate himself , it had seemed much longer . His exertions had consumed the oxygen in his system voraciously , causing him to feel suffocated much too quickly . Reflecting later , he could remember nothing specific during the incident , just a black space filled with terror . <p> Cavers are nothing if not persistent . Calming himself , Vash went in once again , taking care to go all the way down to the tunnel 's floor this time . He cleared the ceiling but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it pressed against the surface of his body and helmet . This was a very tight scrabble while completely submerged in zero-visibility , 32-degree water . He had been told to expect such conditions , but as veterans of combat can confirm , no matter how great the effort , thinking about such things is never adequate preparation for their reality . <p> Over the next few days , both teams brought more supplies to the deep camp , creating caving 's version of the high camp in mountaineering , the final resting place before the launch of the summit assault.Working so hard that deep , Vash was discovering something as true in supercaves as it is for mountaineers on 8,000-metre peaks : the body does not really recover under such conditions but deteriorates more or less rapidly , depending on the individual . Most supercave expedition members lose a pound a day or more ; few are fat to begin with , their bodies soon begin eating their own muscles . <p> The explorers spent October 18 sewing up tattered dry suits , collecting odds and ends of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping . They were all aware that they could well be on the verge of making history . After a huge supper , everyone went to bed at 9.25pm . Maddeningly , despite his exhaustion , Vash was so excited that he could not sleep that night . He got up early : 6.05am . This was it , the sharp , final point to which everything had brought them . <p> At 9am they left camp ; they arrived at the Large Fork 90 minutes later , bringing along heavy bags of rope and hardware to explore any breakthroughs . In profile on a map , the new section of cave leading downward looks something like a decrepit stairway . Vash and Gostev set about surveying one set of passages and pits . Surveying finished , the pair climbed back up to the Large Fork , rejoined the others , and then all descended to the place where Kasjan and Medvedeva had been working . <p> Vash perceived at once that this section was both beautiful and promising . The limestone reminded him of the delicate hues of raspberry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here , too , the pitches were both wider and steeper -- harbingers of depth . Presently , the entire team was gathered at the deepest point Kasjan and Medvedeva had reached . It was a small chamber , on the far side of which a steep pitch dropped off into darkness . It was eerily quiet . Kasjan was studying his altimeter intently . At some point during the last half-hour , they had exceeded 2,000 metres -- 6,562 feet . This in itself was an epochal milestone , akin to the first ascent of an 8,000-metre peak . <p> The next pitch would tell the tale . Kasjan adjusted his helmet lamps and slipped into the opening . Medvedeva followed , then Vash , then the others . They worked their way down three more vertical pitches separated by inclined passages and finally dropped into a triangular-shaped room , perhaps 15 feet on a side , with a flat , clay bottom and nondescript brown walls . Their light beams danced over floor and walls like frantic white spiders , but they could see no more windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tri-cornered room 's clay floor there was a circular , craterlike depression about three feet in diameter and two-feet deep . Down at its bottom , the hole came to a point , like the drain in a sink ( which it might well have been at one time ) , and in that spot was lodged a small white rock . Vash and the others leant over the hole in Krubera 's floor as Kasjan used his altimeter to calculate the depth of that ultimate white rock . He straightened up , waited a moment , and announced : \" Two thousand and eighty metres \" . The team erupted with cheers . <p> Discoverers in caves are privileged to name their new finds . It did not take long to reach consensus about the bottom of the world . They knew where they were , and how very long it had taken to get there , and how many other explorers had made this final act possible . They gave the place a name that , they hoped , captured all those things : Game Over . ",

did stop . red-and-white plastic survey tape hung across the narrow passage he had been ascending . the message , scrawled on notebook paper , was affixed to the tape at chest level . afloat in the cave 's absolute darkness , the white paper burned so brightly in the beam of stone 's headlamp that it almost hurt his eyes . the time was shortly before midnight on march 1 1991 , though that made no particular difference -- it was always midnight in a cave . <p> stone , a hard-driving man with a doctorate in structural engineering , stood 6ft 4in tall and weighed 200lb . he was one of the leaders of an expedition trying to make the last great terrestrial discovery by proving that cheve was the deepest cave on earth . <p> with three companions , he was halfway through the gruelling , two-day climb back to the surface from the cave 's deepest known point , something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the note and tape had been strung just before the expedition 's camp two , where four others were staying . <h> related articles <p> they explained to stone what had happened . at about 1.30pm , a caver from indiana named chris yeager , 25 years old , had entered the cave with an older , more experienced man , peter haberland . yeager had been caving for just two years , and going into cheve was , for him , like a climber who had been on only small vermont mountains suddenly tackling everest . <p> seriously concerned about the younger man 's safety , a veteran , elite cave explorer named jim smith sat yeager down for what should have been a sobering , 30-minute lecture : do n't go into the cave without a guide , carry only a light daypack at first , learn the route in segments , get \" acclimatised \" to the underground world before going in for a long stay . the warnings fell on deaf ears . yeager started his first trip with a 55lb pack , planning on a seven-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the top of a cliff that had been named the 23-metre drop because it was exactly that , a 75-feet free drop from lip to pit that had to be rappelled . by supercaving standards , where free vertical drops hundreds of feet long are common , this was little more than a hop down . haberland went first , completing an easy rappel without incident . at the bottom he detached his rappel rack ( a metal device resembling a big paper clip with transverse bars ) from the rope , then moved away to avoid any rocks yeager might dislodge . <p> above , yeager was wearing standard descent equipment , which included a seat harness similar to those used by rock climbers but beefed up for the heavier demands of caving . a locking carabiner ( an aluminium loop , about the size of a pack of cigarettes , with a hinged \" gate \" on one side ) connected the harness to his rappel rack , and the rappel rack connected him to the rope . the rope wove through the rack 's bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder . before going farther , yeager had to transfer his rack from the rope he had been descending to a new one . <p> he made the change successfully , leant back to begin his rappel , and realised instantly that something was wrong . the rope did not stop his backward-tilting motion . instead , he kept going , as if tipping over backward in a chair . somehow his harness had become separated from the rappel rack , which was still attached to the rope . <p> instinctively , he lunged to grab the rope and the dangling rappel rack , but his heavy pack made any self-arrest impossible . he fell so quickly that he did n't have time to scream . <p> as the 21st century began , we believed that every one of the earth 's great discoveries had been made . almost a century had passed since peary first trod the north pole and amundsen the south . hillary and norgay summated mount everest in 1953 , piccard and walsh dove the deepest ocean in 1960 . armstrong and aldrin walked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of discovery were wrong . when the third millennium rolled round , one last great terrestrial discovery did still await : the deepest cave on earth . <p> the subterranean world remains the greatest geographic unknown on this planet -- called \" the eighth continent \" by some . mountains , ocean depths , the moon , and even martian scapes can be -- and have been -- revealed and explored by humans or our robotic surrogates . not so caves . they are the sole remaining realm that can be experienced only first-hand , by direct human presence . <p> there are also rabid bats , snakes , troglodytic scorpions and spiders , radon , and microbes that cause horrific diseases . kitum cave on the kenya-uganda border is believed to be the birthplace of the ebola virus . <p> by the turn of the 21st century , three crucial things had become clear about the last great terrestrial discovery . first , it probably would be made within a decade . second , it would almost certainly be made in one of two places : the abkhazia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oaxaca , in southern mexico . finally , one of two men would lead the discovery team . they were the ukrainian alexander klimchouk and the american bill stone , both of whom had devoted their lives to the search for the bottom of the world . <p> klimchouk and stone fit nicely into a list of opposites . klimchouk is short and slight . stone is towering and muscular . klimchouk is quiet , self-effacing , and avuncular . stone is bold , brash , and commanding . for stone , science is a means to an end : exploring . he sees himself as a \" pioneer \" who opens new realms where others can follow . for klimchouk , it is the other way around : science is the end and caves are the laboratories in which he does it . <p> it was in 2004 that the stage was set for an epic race to find the deepest cave on earth . even the normally staid national geographic magazine borrowed a phrase from jules verne to describe it : \" the race to the centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in mexico , and the krubera cave , in georgia , have very little in common . <p> both are true supercaves , thousands of feet deep and with many miles of surveyed passages , but there the similarities end . cheve resembles a gigantic l , with an initial shaft dropping about 3,000 feet and an elongated foot descending for almost two more miles at a moderate slope of roughly 10 degrees . krubera , on the other hand , is 90 per cent vertical , pitch ( a vertical drop ) after pitch connected by short passages called meanders . while non-cavers would be terrorised by the yawning pits , one of which is 500-feet deep , experienced cavers look forward to their thrilling rappels , if not to their grinding ascents . <p> traversing krubera 's many meanders is like crawling under your car ( while half submerged in flowing water ) for thousands of yards . the caves ' body temperatures are also different . cheve is cool but relatively mild , with air temperatures that range from 47 degrees at its entrance to the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> krubera , on the other hand , is freezing , the kind of cold that , when you 're working with water and wind , can quickly put you into third-stage , potentially fatal hypothermia . the inflowing water is never much more than 32 degrees ; unprotected survival time in water that cold is 15 minutes or less . <p> in a supercave every step taken , every knot tied and soup bowl filled and latrine used and map read requires the circle of light from a headlamp or flashlight . prolonged , absolute darkness has profound effects on the human body and mind . veteran texas caver r d milhollin made his first cheve entry during a 2003 expedition . reaching camp two , he and his three companions settled in to eat and sleep for a day or two . wanting to conserve batteries , they kept their lights off except for essential tasks . after not very long , though , they confessed to one another that the cave was doing strange things to their minds . <p> milhollin was hearing phantom noises and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . they decamped promptly the next morning . <p> stone had never hesitated to proclaim to the world that cheve had a proven potential to be the deepest cave in the world , even if it meant spending more than a month underground and diving far enough to effectively separate from the main expedition . he also knew that krubera had the potential to go just as deep , and that klimchouk was determined to prove that it did . stone decided to make his all-out attempt in mexico in 2004 . his expedition party left austin , texas , on february 22 2004 . <p> the general population of supercave explorers breaks down into specialist subtribes : leaders and sherpas , bolters and ropers and riggers , lead climbers and divers and diggers . diggers endure hours of confinement in squeezes so tight they can barely breathe and can move only one hand . they dig like giant moles , using tools ranging from their fingernails to hi-tech titanium implements to gasoline-powered hammer drills . <p> diggers are essential to supercave exploration . it is not unusual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockages are breakdown ( jagged boulders that had broken from the ceiling over aeons and continued to do so unpredictably ) and boulder chokes , but quite often they are not truly terminal . if the cavers can feel air movement coming through a wall of breakdown or boulders , it makes sense to try to find a way through . <p> in march 2004 , john kerr , one of the world 's greatest diggers and another caver , bart hogan , were burrowing down a tunnel in the aguacate river sink cave , which stone hoped would link to the main cheve cave . kerr took the lead with his titanium tool and burrowed 150 feet forward . hogan , crawling a good distance behind , called to kerr . <p> no reply . hogan called again and again , with no response . he was beginning to fear the worst -- that kerr might have suffocated -- when the other man finally came backing out with frightening news . the tunnel 's ceiling had collapsed on him , burying the length of his body to eye level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , \" he reported calmly . <p> on march 22 , without a major breakthrough , stone 's team returned to the surface . they had made it no further than 4,869 feet ( 1,484 metres ) deep . stone vowed to return . he had not proven cheve to be the deepest cave on earth . it remained to be seen , halfway around the world , what klimchouk and his cavers would prove about krubera in 2004 . <p> supercaves teach those who explore them any number of things , and scepticism is a big one . the numbers work like this : hundreds of promising leads produce a few dozen explorable passages , which , most often , end in piles of boulders or flooded tunnels or simply blank walls . once in a great while , an explorable passage will go , and once in an ever-greater while , one will just keep going . but those , the fabulous ones that have no stop in them , are rare . <p> klimchouk quantified how things had played out over the years . of hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent yielded more depth and distance ; only one per cent produced substantial breakthroughs . <p> klimchouk led an expedition to krubera in august 2004 , paving the way for another effort in october . at that point , he had been in the field for two and a half months . he could not manage another month away from family , university , and laboratory . someone else would have to lead the next effort . <p> yury kasjan was the logical choice . he knew krubera as well as anyone . like klimchouk , kasjan was a fine leader , quiet but good-natured ; had unbelievable stamina ; and was technically adept at all aspects of extreme caving . <p> nine cavers would work underground in two separate groups . the first group included kasjan and emil vash , a tall , slender 22-year-old student ; ekaterina medvedeva , 23 , igor ischenko , 36 , and kyryl gostev , 21 , rounded out the team . they would be the expedition 's spearhead . <p> day by day , like mountaineers climbing up to successively higher camps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on october 11 they occupied the 1,400-metre camp . that lowest spot would become this expedition 's jumping-off point . everything previous was just preparation . <p> to reach that camp , however , they had to get themselves , their gear , and their supplies through a short but treacherous sump . in common usage , a sump is a place , lower than its surroundings , where liquid collects . sumps in caves are long , winding , flooded tunnels . in places they are so tight that divers have to stop , doff their tanks , push them through , and then follow , donning their equipment again only when the passage widens sufficiently . <p> that description really does not do the procedure justice , though , because you remain connected to your air tanks only by the regulator hose and mouthpiece . it takes not much force at all to yank the mouthpiece from between your teeth , and if that happens , in what is almost certain to be zero visibility , your chances of finding it again before you drown are not so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment was not absolutely essential . but it was long and tight enough to stretch a breath-hold dive to its extreme limits . because bringing scuba gear involved another whole dimension of logistics , kasjan had elected to traverse this sump by breath-hold diving . vash knew he would have to go through if he was to have any chance of reaching krubera 's bottom . <p> on october 12 , the day of the planned sump crossing , vash found himself too nervous to eat breakfast . he had been told that the underwater tunnel was about 30 inches high and 10-feet long . what made it so dangerous was that it was just 18 inches wide , roughly the diameter of a large pizza . in addition , its walls were rough and spiked with protrusions that could easily snag a caver . it would not take long to drown in those conditions . <p> he would do well to be able to hold his breath for 60 seconds in water that cold . throw in the added factors of panic and wild attempts to extricate oneself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a premonition that he would not make it through , but he pushed on regardless . he hyperventilated to blow carbon dioxide out of his system , held a last breath , and dove . his premonition quickly came true . he did n't submerge deeply enough and , halfway through , his helmet caught on a ceiling obstruction . <p> panicking , he flailed back out of the sump and surfaced , unnerved and gasping . it had been one of the worst moments of his caving career . <p> though it had taken only 20 seconds or so for vash to extricate himself , it had seemed much longer . his exertions had consumed the oxygen in his system voraciously , causing him to feel suffocated much too quickly . reflecting later , he could remember nothing specific during the incident , just a black space filled with terror . <p> cavers are nothing if not persistent . calming himself , vash went in once again , taking care to go all the way down to the tunnel 's floor this time . he cleared the ceiling but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it pressed against the surface of his body and helmet . this was a very tight scrabble while completely submerged in zero-visibility , 32-degree water . he had been told to expect such conditions , but as veterans of combat can confirm , no matter how great the effort , thinking about such things is never adequate preparation for their reality . <p> over the next few days , both teams brought more supplies to the deep camp , creating caving 's version of the high camp in mountaineering , the final resting place before the launch of the summit assault.working so hard that deep , vash was discovering something as true in supercaves as it is for mountaineers on 8,000-metre peaks : the body does not really recover under such conditions but deteriorates more or less rapidly , depending on the individual . most supercave expedition members lose a pound a day or more ; few are fat to begin with , their bodies soon begin eating their own muscles . <p> the explorers spent october 18 sewing up tattered dry suits , collecting odds and ends of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping . they were all aware that they could well be on the verge of making history . after a huge supper , everyone went to bed at 9.25pm . maddeningly , despite his exhaustion , vash was so excited that he could not sleep that night . he got up early : 6.05am . this was it , the sharp , final point to which everything had brought them . <p> at 9am they left camp ; they arrived at the large fork 90 minutes later , bringing along heavy bags of rope and hardware to explore any breakthroughs . in profile on a map , the new section of cave leading downward looks something like a decrepit stairway . vash and gostev set about surveying one set of passages and pits . surveying finished , the pair climbed back up to the large fork , rejoined the others , and then all descended to the place where kasjan and medvedeva had been working . <p> vash perceived at once that this section was both beautiful and promising . the limestone reminded him of the delicate hues of raspberry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> here , too , the pitches were both wider and steeper -- harbingers of depth . presently , the entire team was gathered at the deepest point kasjan and medvedeva had reached . it was a small chamber , on the far side of which a steep pitch dropped off into darkness . it was eerily quiet . kasjan was studying his altimeter intently . at some point during the last half-hour , they had exceeded 2,000 metres -- 6,562 feet . this in itself was an epochal milestone , akin to the first ascent of an 8,000-metre peak . <p> the next pitch would tell the tale . kasjan adjusted his helmet lamps and slipped into the opening . medvedeva followed , then vash , then the others . they worked their way down three more vertical pitches separated by inclined passages and finally dropped into a triangular-shaped room , perhaps 15 feet on a side , with a flat , clay bottom and nondescript brown walls . their light beams danced over floor and walls like frantic white spiders , but they could see no more windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tri-cornered room 's clay floor there was a circular , craterlike depression about three feet in diameter and two-feet deep . down at its bottom , the hole came to a point , like the drain in a sink ( which it might well have

white rock . he straightened up , waited a moment , and announced : \" two thousand and eighty metres \" . the team erupted with cheers . <p> discoverers in caves are privileged to name their new finds . it did not take long to reach consensus about the bottom of the world . they knew where they were , and how very long it had taken to get there , and how many other explorers had made this final act possible . they gave the place a name that , they hoped , captured all those things : game over .

"text": "<h> You are here : <h> Looking back at Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets <h> Our look back at the Harry Potter franchise continues , as Mark delves into 2002 's The Chamber Of Secrets ... <p> Three days after Harry Potter And The Philosopher 's Stone was released worldwide and broke box office records here , there and everywhere in its opening weekend , production pushed forward on the first sequel . <p> Warner Bros had all of the cast contracted for the first four films , and immediately exercised its option for part 2 , targeting a November 2002 release date . Behind the scenes , Steve Kloves reprised his screen-writing role and Chris Columbus returned to the director 's chair . <p> Picking up a few weeks after the first film 's happy ending , Harry Potter is pretty miserable . He has n't heard from his wizarding friends all summer and he 's living with the Dursleys once again , who enact a classic sitcom situation , with Uncle Vernon 's boss coming round for dinner in the first ten minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobby materialises in Harry 's bedroom ! Sitcom antics aside , Dobby is here to get the story going , by insisting that Harry does n't return to Hogwarts for his second year , lest he fall prey to a terrible evil . Via flying Ford Anglia , Harry is soon rescued from his relatives by the Weasleys . <p> It 's not long into the school year , however , when that terrible evil rears its head . According to a message daubed in blood , the Chamber of Secrets has been opened by the heir of Hogwarts co-founder , Salazar Slytherin . And now the horror from within the chamber is loose in the castle , trying to kill off students . <p> Here 's a story that lends itself to arguments about the logic of keeping Slytherin open at Hogwarts . Maggie Smith 's Professor McGonagall always mentions Slytherin last when listing the school houses , and with such an inflection that she might as well have said \" Evil House \" instead . It 's a vagary of the film series , that it never quite explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's students into a house with a reputation for turning out evil wizards . Still , this one delves into Hogwarts history and introduces one of the series ' central themes , that of prejudice . <p> In wizarding genealogy , having two wizarding parents , who only have magical heritage , makes you ' pure-blood ' However , it 's also possible to come into magical power even if your parents are non-magical Muggles , which makes you ' Muggle-born ' . ' Half-bloods ' , which come up later in the series , are the result of a union between a pure-blood and either a Muggle-born or a Muggle . <p> With me so far ? Well , there 's naturally some in-fighting amongst the different types of wizard , largely fuelled by the pure-bloods , and Slytherin alumni 's deep-seated ignorance about Muggle-borns . Muggle-born Hermione , arguably the most talented student of the lot , is on the receiving end of racial hatred with the invented slur \" Mudblood \" . <p> This development gives a nastier edge to schoolyard bully , Draco Malfoy , played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by Jason Isaacs . The two of them are condescending and cruel , and their family 's been pure-blood Slytherins for centuries . That makes Draco the prime suspect as the heir of Slytherin , as far as our trio of amateur wizarding sleuths are concerned . <p> If you have n't guessed , that detour fills in for their suspicion of Snape in the first film , and once again , it turns out Lord Voldemort is the root of the trouble . The method of his return through his 16-year-old self 's diary becomes intrinsically important towards the end of the series , but that 's a link for another time . <p> As far as the B plots of the film are concerned , the usual blind reverence to the source material is present and correct . Detours spring up left , right and centre , tenuously linked from scene to scene in an attempt to hold the abrupt tonal shifts as part of one story . <p> At one hundred and sixty-one minutes , this film is the longest of the series , based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , few of the Harry Potter films are more successful in preserving the complexities of the Christiesque mystery story that Rowling weaves into her novels . Then again , it 's no less sudden when the baddy turns out to be Lord Voldemort , hiding under an anagram . <p> Tom Marvolo Riddle , Voldemort 's real name , was nearly reverse engineered by Rowling from \" I Am Lord Voldemort \" , something that Columbus literally spells out in flaming letters on the screen . Anagrams are a dangerous route to take , because it gets fans looking for patterns that are not there . A few years ago , factions of book fans were convinced that the name of wand-making shop Ollivander 's was code for either ' Ronald lives ' or ' Ronald 's evil ' . <p> On the topic of Ronald , Rupert Grint 's performance sums up so much of what is misjudged in this instalment . Directed to squeak and squeal for comic effect in action scenes , it actually foregoes the actor 's natural comic timing and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's saddled with ripe dialogue like \" The invisibility booster must be faulty ! \" <p> But it 's no easier for Daniel Radcliffe , whose particular brand of wonderment takes on the form of just repeating certain words questioningly . Both actors ' voices had broken in the year since they filmed the first one , so perhaps that 's why it feels like they 're adjusting to their roles all over again . <p> As usual , the grownups fare better . New additions to the cast , along with the brilliant Jason Isaacs , include Kenneth Branagh as vainglorious Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher , Gilderoy Lockhart . He 's a character who 's ultimately swept into a subplot , despite being present for part of the climax , but Branagh justifies his inclusion with an enjoyable comic turn . Stay for after the end credits , too . <p> A special mention ought to go to Richard Harris , who passed away a week before the premiere of this film . In his two turns as Professor Dumbledore , he exudes wisdom , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly humour and reassuring presence . Also , the character appears to get drunk and cancel all exams at the end , probably ruining the academic chances of older students . So , at least he finishes in style . <p> It 's good to see Toby Jones ' performance come through the CGI Dobby , although WETA Digital also created a much more lauded digital character through Andy Serkis ' rendition of Gollum in The Lord Of The Rings : The Two Towers , released a month after this one . In fact , all of the CGI is much improved from Philosopher 's Stone , the biggest achievement being the Basilisk , a giant snake that appears in the final act . <p> But , really , the star of this film is Stuart Craig for his production design . This film arguably holds some of his most accomplished work on the series , with grand sets like the Weasley homestead , the Burrow , and the titular Chamber of Secrets looking absolutely stunning on screen . There 's no faulting the visuals in this one , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But each of the different directors on the Potter series tended to emphasise different aspects , leaving their own imprint and telling the story through different means . Chris Columbus essentially made two films that were very much like his earlier film , Young Sherlock Holmes , although the source novels are very close to that template themselves , boarding school mystery stories . <p> But if Philosopher 's Stone was quaint , Chamber Of Secrets feels slightly cheesy . The humour is hit and miss , and certain emotional beats come across as mawkish and sentimental . The final scene , especially , is pure Camembert . It 's not the tone you want for a story in which a giant snake attempts a genocidal rampage against schoolchildren . <p> Terry Gilliam , who was beaten to the director 's post on Philosopher 's Stone by Columbus , has been less favourable in his assessment . Believing himself to be the perfect fit for the series , Gilliam once told The New York Post that \" ... Chris Columbus ' versions are terrible . Just dull . Pedestrian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secrets is a tantalising one , and it is a shame that he never got to helm one of the films . <p> Much more than its predecessor , Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets feels like it 's made up of tentative steps into a new world . It 's hobbled slightly by the unwavering reverence for the source material , which ultimately makes it less creative than its own production design . As Gilliam said , it 's more pedestrian , the kind of adaptation Warner Bros wanted at that stage . <p> It 's not a bad movie , by any stretch , and parts of it are very good . But when you see what was to come post-Columbus , it feels like a missed opportunity of sorts . After the speedy turnaround on this sequel , the series would go on to a regular cycle of one film every eighteen months , and so 2004 's Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban would bring a major sea change .

"text": "<h> You are here : <h> Battle : Los Angeles - Den Of Geek goes on a military training day <h> To tie in with the home release of Battle : Los Angeles , we sent our roving adventurer Nick off on a military training day . Here 's what happened ... <p> Maybe it 's because I went to the last Den Of Geek quiz dressed in full combat fatigues , or perhaps it 's my ' I Heart Guns ' badge , but either way I found myself on the receiving end of a phone call inviting me to take part in an army training boot camp day to celebrate the launch of Battle : Los Angeles on DVD and Blu-ray . <p> Having survived , nay thrived , on similar excursions ( once dressing as a WWII Marine and another time as a Roman ) I thought , \" Yeah , bring it on . I 'm the damn king of these sort of things . A quick dress up , breeze through some drills , play with a fake gun and then home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The first clue things were going to be different was the location , an abandoned warehouse complex somewhere south of London . A local taxi informed another journalist there that the place did n't really exist anymore . Ominous . Once there we were met by men wearing a lot of body armour and stroking guns . Ushered inside into the crumbling factory , we saw yet more guns , and more heavily tooled up guys . <p> It quickly transpired that a lot of them were ex-military or law enforcement , and our lead trainer for the day would be an actual soldier , known only as Dan ( as moonlighting for things like this is strictly frowned upon in the military ) . The aim of the day was to experience the exact boot camp conditions that the actors went through while preparing for the film . The timetable looked intense . Eight hours of becoming men ( and one woman ) . <p> We would receive basic weapons training and instruction with the Airsoft guns . For those unfamiliar with Airsoft , I can reliably inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead of paint pellets , you fire gas-powered plastic ball bearings at each other . <p> This means the guns and tactical situations you can be placed in are a hell of a lot more realistic , and are one of the reasons the real deal army guys prefer it . The bastard pellets also hurt a hell of a lot if you get hit with one , and can do some real damage , as evidenced by the smashed teeth of one of the instructors . <p> It was at about this point I wondered if I could sneak out the back and run for safety . <p> However , the only running I seemed to be doing was back and forth during our firing exercises . To say these so-called easy warm-up exercises were hardcore would be understating it . Panting for breath after every move and fire , it was only the threat of being shot in the nuts that kept me moving . And yes , that was a real threat . <p> Gradually , though , our small team of foppish , mincing media types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command in an instant , peeling right and left , move and covering , easy . <p> Having successfully bested basic training , we moved on to the more extreme special forces stuff , close quarters battle and dynamic entry . This involved working in our team of four to scout out a door to a potentially hostile room , then essentially breaking down the door and neutralising any threats inside . In real life this is an incredibly dangerous task , as the first person in is usually killed straight away by any hostiles inside . <p> To make the task as realistic as possible , the trainers posed as both hostages and terrorists , forcing us to either shoot them or rescue them , both usually with a degree of force . It also meant we got to legitimately kick in a door while waving a gun about and shouting , \" Get down on the floor , motherfucker ! \" It 's the stuff childhood dreams are made of . <p> Once Dan the army man was suitably impressed at our CQB skills , and our ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more serious stuff . This meant putting away our protective mesh goggles and donning full face masks . We looked mean , but my elephant t-shirt somewhat spoilt the effect . Still , eco-warriors are dangerous , yeah ? <p> Anyway , now it was time for what was scarily called pressure testing , where all our newfound killers skills would be put to the test under a pretty life-like scenario . <p> We had to rescue three hostages and escort them to safety , while potentially coming under attack . And without further ado , we were off , clearing rooms like we had learnt , one by one , until suddenly we were under attack ! And these pellets really sting when they hit . <p> But , no matter . We 'd found the hostages , shot the bad guys ( eventually , I had a slight hesitation when I found one hostage having a gun pointed at his head . I genuinely thought , \" Can I really pull the trigger and kill a man ? \" ) , and led our hostages out of there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb or I 'll shoot you in the bollocks . \" I believe the SAS would consider that unorthodox . <p> Thinking that we 'd achieved our aims almost too easily , we led the hostages out to what we thought was safety , only to - boom - be nailed in an ambush . Smoke bombs and flash bangs went off , the team panicked and ran . None of us made the slightest bit of sense . ( Genuinely . Due to adrenalin 's effect on the brain , your higher functions , including language , suffer and you talk gibberish . That 's how real this simulation felt . ) <p> But somehow we muddled through and out the other side . But with only one hostage . The others had seemingly been killed in the mayhem . Oops . <p> As an insight into the film , a day like this is brilliant . Battle : Los Angeles wo n't be winning any awards for its script , but there 's no doubting it 's a genuinely excellent visceral experience . There 's a school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respond to the on-screen action with physical reactions . When it comes to a movie like this , I would have to genuinely agree , and knowing what the actors went through to prepare and then shoot the film , it adds to the thrill of watching aliens blowing a lot of shit up . <p> The guys who organised our day did a great job at recreating the tension and excitement of a real combat situation , and I would highly recommend trying it out if you 've ever had any impulse to play at war .

<p> anyway , now it was time for what was scarily called pressure testing , where all our newfound killers skills would be put to the test under a pretty life-like scenario . <p> we had to rescue three hostages and escort them to safety , while potentially coming under attack . and without further ado , we were off , clearing rooms like we had learnt , one by one , until suddenly we were under attack ! and these pellets really sting when they hit . <p> but , no matter . we 'd found the hostages , shot the bad guys ( eventually , i had a slight hesitation when i found one hostage having a gun pointed at his head . i genuinely thought , \" can i really pull the trigger and kill a man ? \" ) , and led our hostages out of there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bomb or i 'll shoot you in the bollocks . \" i believe the sas would consider that unorthodox . <p> thinking that we 'd achieved our aims almost too easily , we led the hostages out to what we thought was safety , only to - boom - be nailed in an ambush . smoke bombs and flash bangs went off , the team panicked and ran . none of us made the slightest bit of sense . ( genuinely . due to adrenalin 's effect on the brain , your higher functions , including language , suffer and you talk gibberish . that 's how real this simulation felt . ) <p> but somehow we muddled through and out the other side . but with only one hostage . the others had seemingly been killed in the mayhem . oops . <p> as an insight into the film , a day like this is brilliant . battle : los angeles wo n't be winning any awards for its script , but there 's no doubting it 's a genuinely excellent visceral experience . there 's a school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respond to the on-screen action with physical reactions . when it comes to a movie like this , i would have to genuinely agree , and knowing what the actors went through to prepare and then shoot the film , it adds to the thrill of watching aliens blowing a lot of shit up . <p> the guys who organised our day did a great job at recreating the tension and excitement of a real combat situation , and i would highly recommend trying it out if you 've ever had any impulse to play at war . however , be prepared for a tough day . after all that running about and diving to the floor i still ca n't really move my legs .

"text": "<h> You are here : <h> The Good , The Bad And The Multiplex by Mark Kermode review <h> Mark Kermode 's latest book asks the question : what 's wrong with modern movies ? Here 's our review of The Good , The Bad And The Multiplex ... <p> If you 've got a sense of bafflement over how modern day cinema can give us three $1bn+ grossing films in a year , but still wo n't stump up for an individual projectionist or an usher or two down at your local multiplex , then you 'll be in good company with Mark Kermode 's latest book . <p> The Good , The Bad And The Multiplex is a fleshing out of many of the arguments familiar to those who listen to the Kermode and Mayo film programme on Radio Five Live . And , teased with the subtitle ' What 's wrong with modern movies ? ' , you might be forgiven for thinking that you 're getting 313 page of full-on Kermodian ranting . <p> But you 're not . Instead , you 're getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Interestingly , it 's less than you might think about some of the films themselves ( although Michael Bay 's Christmas card list is rarely likely to have Kermode 's name on it ) , but rather the apparatus and system that surrounds then . <p> Firmly in Kermode 's crosshairs are 3D , multiplex cinemas ( illustrated through a painfully funny attempt to watch Charlie St Cloud at his local cinema ) , blockbuster movies , film critics , and where Britain itself fits into world cinema . <p> Take 3D as an example . The world has no shortage of anti-3D rantings , but what Kermode presents in his book is an argument . An argument very much in his own voice , with his own strong viewpoint on the matter . But an argument nonetheless , which takes in both sides of the debate , before arriving at a conclusion , albeit one more obvious than the ending of your standard rom-com . Dripping with rounded examples , Kermode is n't trying to bully you to his way of thinking -- rather , he 's being accessibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is n't a film where hardened film buffs only need apply . Just as with his last book , It 's Only A Movie , Kermode 's writing style is chatty and welcoming , fused with energy and a love of his subject matter . <p> Ironically , the people who the book may end up appealing to the least are Kermode 's regular listeners . He captures many of the key themes of his radio broadcasts here , but there are inevitably fewer surprises for those more familiar with his work . That said , the chances are that you 'll find yourself nodding along with much of what he has to say anyway , and it 's a strong , well-researched , entertaining representation of his thoughts that you 're getting here . <p> If I had a personal favourite part of the book , it 's when he pinpoints the problem of distribution , and how it 's becoming harder and harder for small films to get a look in . Here 's where some of his arguments hold the most surprises , and you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good , The Bad And The Multiplex generates in exchange for this particular system being fixed . <p> And that 's the critical thing , here . Kermode has a passion that you may or may not personally warm to , but it 's a thirst and desire for things to improve nonetheless . It might be idealistic at times , but it 's hard to criticise someone for that . There 's a longing in his words for cinema to get better , and as such , it 's a brisk and easy book to read and digest , with lots of thinking matter for afterwards . <p> Personally , I 'd just about edge It 's Only A Movie , Kermode 's previous book , over this one . But it 's a close run thing , and with The Good , The Bad And The Multiplex , Kermode has one again married up strong arguments with quality writing . It 's a book well worth seeking out . ",

"text": "<h> An endangered indigenous tribe in Colombia faces an increased risk of extinction after Marxist guerillas hijacked a boat carrying medical aid for them , campaigners have warned . <p> The Nukak people were unknown by the outside world until 1988 but more than 50 per cent of the tribe have since died due to contact with other people introducing diseases into the community . <p> As a result the tribe has been classed as \" at imminent risk of extinction \" by Survival International , which works for the rights of tribal groups worldwide . <p> Now , the non-governmental organisation says that a boat laden with crucial medical supplies destined for the tribe in the northwest Amazon basin has been hijacked by FARC rebels . <p> Survival reports that the boat was on a humanitarian mission led by the National Indigenous Organisation of Colombia ( ONIC ) when it was stopped by guerillas and staff were forced to abandon all surgical equipment , stretchers and even computers . <p> They were then given 20 minutes to leave the area and made to abandon the only boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing \" an even greater risk of extinction on the Nukak \" according to Becca Stenham , of Survival International . <h> Related Articles <p> \" Without access to health care they can not survive , \" she said . \" Before contact , the Nukak would n't have suffered from the diseases they now do , such as respiratory disease . <p> \" The FARC have shown their complete disregard for the well-being of this vulnerable tribe . \" <p> FARC , which has been waging war on Colombia 's government for almost half a century , has come to control many areas of cocaine production , using the profits to fund its insurgency . <p> In recent years the remote rainforest area in the south-east of Colombia that the Nukak inhabit has become overrun by outsiders growing coca for the cocaine trade . <p> The United Nations has warned of a suspected program of \" ethnic cleansing \" of Colombian indigenous groups to make way for drug plantations and also for lucrative palm oil plantations and cattle ranching . <p> As a result many Nukak people have fled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of San Jose del Guaviare . <p> But according to Survival International , up to 400 of a total of 600 Nukak people remain in the jungle , hunting using blowguns with poison darts and feeding on fish , game , turtles , fruit , vegetables , nuts , insects and honey . <p> Stephen Corry , director of the group , said : \" Colombia 's interminable civil war has wreaked death and destruction on the Nukak .

"title": "Bull Bear Market Phases, Dow Theory Update\n",
"text": "<h> Bull Bear Market Phases , Dow Theory Update <p> According to Dow theory , both bull and bear markets have three phases . Between each of these phases there are important counter-trend moves . Our Dow theory founding fathers explained that these counter-trend moves are misleading and tend to be taken as a continuation of the previous long-term secular trend . Based on the longer-term phasing and value aspects of Dow theory , the evidence continues to suggest that the last great bull market began at the December 1974 low and peaked in October 2007 . This data also continues to suggest that the decline into the March 2009 low was merely the Phase I decline and that the rally out of the March 2009 low serves to separate Phase I from Phase II of a much longer-term secular bear market . <p> That 's right , the rally out of the March 2009 low was not a new bull market or a continuation of the previous long-term secular bull market . Rather , it is part of a correction within a much longer-term secular bear market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on my longer-term bull and bear market relationship studies and other historical characteristics , the evidence suggests that once the rally out of the 2009 low has run its course , the Phase II decline should prove to be far more devastating than the Phase I decline . Therefore , from a longer-term perspective I remain very bearish . <p> More recently , on August 4th both the Industrials and the Transports closed below their March 2011 secondary low points . As a result , a Dow theory trend change occurred and since this is the first such trend change since the rally out of the March 2009 low began , we can not take this development lightly . However , history shows that not all Dow theory trend changes are ominous and based on other technical data , there is a very good chance that the rally out of the March 2009 low has not yet run its course . If not , the rally separating Phase I from Phase II is not yet over . The details of these other technical studies are covered in the monthly research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a technical high wire act in that while we do have a Dow theory trend change in place , on the other hand there is also other data that is actually still rather bullish and that suggests a higher level low is being made . This may or may not change and as a technician the key is to monitor the ongoing structural and statistical developments . <p> Based on the prevailing consensus , the current pessimism actually makes perfect sense . As a rule , the market does what it has to in order to confuse the most people . Ever since the decline into August began , it seems that the consensus has turned rather bearish . In fact , I personally know of no one that genuinely believes a move back above the May 2011 high is possible and maybe it is n't . But , I do find it very interesting that such bearishness is being seen in conjunction with such inconclusive technical data . As a result , it seems that the most confusing thing the market could do is to continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1966 to 1974 bear market period below for comparison . The decline into the 1966 low marked the Phase I decline of the 1966 to 1974 secular bear market . This decline appears to be synonymous with the decline into the 2009 low . The rally separating Phase I from Phase II of the 1966 to 1974 bear market carried price up some 26 months into the 1968 top . I continue to believe that the rally out of the March 2009 low is synonymous with the rally into the 1968 top . Once all of the technical factors are in place I look for the fallout to be much the same as was seen following the 1968 top . I realize that the same old message and comparison is not exciting or sexy . But , the message of the market it is what it is as the bear continues to confuse the masses . Once the technical DNA Markers are all in place , the Phase II decline should get very very nasty .

"text": "<p> There are very few racehorse trainers who would , or could , bring Bob Dylan , FC Barcelona , Roberto Duran and an economics lesson into a 45-minute discussion about the sport of kings . Indeed there might only be one : the ferociously intelligent , fiercely eloquent and altogether rather formidable John Gosden . <p> He would be formidable even if he did n't stand six foot and quite a bit in his stockinged feet , but his stature somehow compounds the sense that this is a fellow whose views are worth listening to , especially when they concern the future of his beloved Flat racing . Moreover , 60-year-old Gosden is the turf 's man of the moment .

"text": "<h> Instant messengers <p> Histories of momentous events are being written more rapidly . But does an increase in immediacy lead to a loss of perspective ? <p> In 1936 , a journalist for China Weekly Review called Edgar Snow travelled to north-west China to interview Mao Zedong . Mao told his officials to greet Snow with \" security , secrecy , warmth and red carpet \" , for he wanted him to perform a vital task -- to shape Mao 's image in the west . <p> \" Mao offered Snow a mixture of valuable information and colossal falsification which Snow swallowed in toto , \" write Jung Chang and Jon Halliday in their 2005 biography Mao . \" Mao covered up years of torture and murder ... and invented battles and heroism in the trek across China , now astutely titled ' the Long March . ' \" <h> IN Life &amp; Arts <p> The result , published in 1937 , was Red Star Over China , a sympathetic account of the Red Guards ' campaign against the nationalists that influenced how Mao was regarded outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how history would be written -- as did Lenin , who provided a glowing introduction to John Reed 's account of the 1917 Russian revolution , Ten Days That Shook the World ( 1919 ) . <p> Yet these accounts -- especially that of Reed , who was on assignment in Russia for the socialist magazine The Masses at the time -- also capture aspects of those events that would be impossible for a historian to recreate from scratch years after the event . Whatever their shortcomings in completeness or historical perspective , they have documentary value . <p> Intimate accounts of world-changing events are now well-established in non-fiction publishing , with numerous examples provided by the 2008 financial crisis and by political events such as this year 's Egyptian revolution . Michael Lewis , whose 2009 book The Big Short narrated how hedge fund traders bet against the mortgage bubble , is back this month with Boomerang , a tour of countries such as Iceland and Greece that are still suffering the aftermath . <p> John Reed , who chronicled the Russian revolution <p> Indeed , history is being written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a couple of years to get from research to publication . Lewis 's latest has been \" crashed \" by its publishers . He completed it on August 15 , incorporating material from articles written originally for Vanity Fair magazine , and it will be published early this month , just seven weeks on . Yet even that turnround may come to be seen as leisurely in the new world of publishing . <p> The traditional delay of up to a year between a book 's completion and publication was partly enforced by the \" pipeline \" for distributing and marketing printed books -- big booksellers such as Barnes &amp; Noble in the US want to clear their shelves of one set of books before taking on another load . The rise of digital books , with ebooks now a bigger market than hardback books in the US , is shortening -- even eliminating -- this pipeline , allowing publishers and self-published authors to produce narratives more rapidly . <p> . . . <p> Yasmine El Rashidi 's first-hand account of the Egyptian revolution , The Battle for Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Books , was published by Random House as an ebook in May , four months after the uprising started . Among its competitors was Tweets from Tahrir , a collection of short observations on Twitter by witnesses to the revolution . It was released in April by OR Books , which specialises in rapid publication of current events titles in electronic and print-on-demand form . OR has also produced books on the BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the Gaza flotilla . <p> This evolution raises big questions about the trade-off between immediacy and accuracy -- or at least perspective . The historian sits down long after the events have occurred with no need to please or flatter the participants to gain access , since most are dead , and the freedom to study a wide variety of sources . A journalist working at high speed has only what he or she witnesses and the details that others -- some with an agenda -- choose to divulge . <p> \" None of us has the right perspective , given how quickly these events unfolded , and we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" says Andrew Ross Sorkin , The New York Times journalist and author of Too Big To Fail ( 2009 ) , which reconstructed the climactic events of the 2008 financial crisis in New York and Washington . \" If you try to write a great analytical book now , you will either be wrong or lucky . \" <p> Lewis says : \" The last thing I want to hold myself out as is as a historian or a prognosticator . I have no clue where this is all going . I am not a wise man , I am a journalist . The historian 's advantage is that he knows how the thing ends . If the eurozone financial crisis ends in war , that 's one story . If it ends with Germany owning half of Greece , it 's another . \" <p> Reporters do have one edge on historians -- they can get to the scene before events fade . El Rashidi , who went to Tahrir Square at the start of the demonstrations , says : \" I did n't step back and think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very aware of feeling that something extraordinary was happening and wanting to share it . You can capture time and the smell and the colour of a place that can not be captured 10 years later . \" <p> William Cohan , author of three books about financial institutions -- Lazard Fr ? res , Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs -- says : \" I find instant histories to be incredibly valuable . You can talk to the people directly involved and you can check what they tell you against documents . Email has become a great first draft of history -- it 's immutable . You can not argue with it . \" <p> Journalists also dig out things that might otherwise remain undiscovered . Cohan says : \" When I was researching Lazard , people would hand me stacks of memos that Felix Rohatyn , a former Lazard partner in New York or Andr ? Meyer , another former senior partner had written and had hoped would be buried and say , ' I knew someone like you would come along one day , so I kept them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because witnesses tend to reshape events over time . \" It is critical to try to do the interviews in as close to real time as possible . I found that the further I got from the event , the worse people 's memory was about detail but the more definite their perspective . They believed they understood it better but they were wrong on facts . \" <p> This human fallibility also applies to historians , Lewis argues . \" The advantage of knowing how events ended is double-edged because once you grasp the outcome , you start to arrange the facts to lead to that outcome . Knowing the ending can distort your understanding of the middle -- you make it neater . \" <p> But , as Snow 's case showed , there is also a price for being on the spot among participants . Mao could select a sympathetic biographer because plenty of others wanted to tell his story and access is often bartered by the key figures in contemporary events in return for favourable treatment . Journalists , such as Bob Woodward of The Washington Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , have been accused of writing accounts that flatter those who spoke to them most . <p> . . . <p> It is particularly difficult for the reader to tell fact from fiction -- or at least which version of the facts is closest to accuracy -- when journalists attempt to reconstruct events by talking to all the participants off the record and presenting a single version of what happened . That has been Woodward 's modus operandi , as well as Sorkin 's in Too Big To Fail . <p> Sorkin says this criticism is overblown . \" I 'm not convinced that those who co-operate always get better treatment . I know of some people who co-operated with me and probably did n't get the treatment that they imagined . \" But he admits that it makes such accounts harder for the reader or a future historian to analyse and unpack -- they simply have to trust the writer . <p> Woodward 's books are rarely disputed by those whose actions and words he records , and Sorkin 's was admired on Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suskind , author of Confidence Men , about economic policy under President Barack Obama , recently came under fire when three of his subjects , including Christina Romer , former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , claimed to have been misquoted . <p> In principle , the two types of history -- an instant account and the long view -- are complementary . The journalist digs up the ground and tries to uncover facts immediately , and the historian assembles all the available data and adds perspective . Rival versions of history may agree on the basic facts but shape them differently to produce varying conclusions . <p> But as contemporary history becomes faster and more partial -- and some versions are written in a style that is hard to prove or disprove -- it may become harder for future historians to gauge its value . The rise of digital media and the sheer deluge of data being recorded by individuals and released by organisations such as WikiLeaks , raises a further possibility -- that historians will be able to circumvent or to ignore the current accounts and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few letters and historical records , they may have a plethora of real-time digital data to comb through . <p> Twitter is only one example of this -- Facebook pages , email , and photographs and videos of current events are all recent phenomena . Yasmine El Rashidi says she watched others in Tahrir Square holding up their phones . \" They were not writing but you could see they were trying to capture the moment , \" she says . They were , in their own way , competing to stamp their perspective on the event . <p> For now , the book tends to carry more weight than individual tweets , photos , or articles in newspapers and magazines . But that may be a historical anomaly -- the fact that printed books have traditionally been of a certain length and have taken time to assemble and publish . As ebook publishing speeds up , the line between books and extended magazine articles will blur . \" There are people who insist that a book is a narrative form that is transhistorical , \" says Colin Robinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been defined as what a binding machine is able physically to hold together . If you remove the constraint , you are left with a continuum between a tweet and a tome . \" <p> Lewis says : \" Because an ebook is a book , it has this authority but , because you can turn it around so quickly , it has the immediacy of a piece of journalism . You are able to attract gravitas to things that were written very recently that you could n't generate before . \" <p> That arbitrage will not last indefinitely . For the moment , anything that is produced by a book publisher is a book , no matter how immediate or distant the events it portrays . But as ebooks get shorter and are published faster , the difference in form will become evident . So too may the differences in value . <p> Journalists and historians have always traded off speed against perspective , especially when covering momentous events . Whereas journalists accept the challenges of time and space pressure , historians just try to get the story right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billionaire financier 's body in his Paris flat , a bullet hole in his heart . Journalists pounce and report in real time . Several of their bestselling books appear within months . A movie is in theatres soon after . Yet historians do not even consider these events until key documents become available decades later . Only then do they write about the financier 's schemes and correct the journalists ' early mistakes . <p> This setting looks like today , with instant media reaction and delayed historical treatment . Yet the subject was Ivar Kreuger , the infamous \" Match King , \" and the year was 1932 . Even then , journalists scrambled to write the first draft of history . Earl Sparling and William Stoneman , two leading journalists who wrote quick biographies of Kreuger , were at least as fast as their modern counterparts , and at least as shackled .

"lower_text": "<h> instant messengers <p> histories of momentous events are being written more rapidly . but does an increase in immediacy lead to a loss of perspective ? <p> in 1936 , a journalist for china weekly review called edgar snow travelled to north-west china to interview mao zedong . mao told his officials to greet snow with \" security , secrecy , warmth and red carpet \" , for he wanted him to perform a vital task -- to shape mao 's image in the west . <p> \" mao offered snow a mixture of valuable information and colossal falsification which snow swallowed in toto , \" write jung chang and jon halliday in their 2005 biography mao . \" mao covered up years of torture and murder ... and invented battles and heroism in the trek across china , now astutely titled ' the long march . ' \" <h> in life &amp; arts <p> the result , published in 1937 , was red star over china , a sympathetic account of the red guards ' campaign against the nationalists that influenced how mao was regarded outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how history would be written -- as did lenin , who provided a glowing introduction to john reed 's account of the 1917 russian revolution , ten days that shook the world ( 1919 ) . <p> yet these accounts -- especially that of reed , who was on assignment in russia for the socialist magazine the masses at the time -- also capture aspects of those events that would be impossible for a historian to recreate from scratch years after the event . whatever their shortcomings in completeness or historical perspective , they have documentary value . <p> intimate accounts of world-changing events are now well-established in non-fiction publishing , with numerous examples provided by the 2008 financial crisis and by political events such as this year 's egyptian revolution . michael lewis , whose 2009 book the big short narrated how hedge fund traders bet against the mortgage bubble , is back this month with boomerang , a tour of countries such as iceland and greece that are still suffering the aftermath . <p> john reed , who chronicled the russian revolution <p> indeed , history is being written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a couple of years to get from research to publication . lewis 's latest has been \" crashed \" by its publishers . he completed it on august 15 , incorporating material from articles written originally for vanity fair magazine , and it will be published early this month , just seven weeks on . yet even that turnround may come to be seen as leisurely in the new world of publishing . <p> the traditional delay of up to a year between a book 's completion and publication was partly enforced by the \" pipeline \" for distributing and marketing printed books -- big booksellers such as barnes &amp; noble in the us want to clear their shelves of one set of books before taking on another load . the rise of digital books , with ebooks now a bigger market than hardback books in the us , is shortening -- even eliminating -- this pipeline , allowing publishers and self-published authors to produce narratives more rapidly . <p> . . . <p> yasmine el rashidi 's first-hand account of the egyptian revolution , the battle for egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books , was published by random house as an ebook in may , four months after the uprising started . among its competitors was tweets from tahrir , a collection of short observations on twitter by witnesses to the revolution . it was released in april by or books , which specialises in rapid publication of current events titles in electronic and print-on-demand form . or has also produced books on the bp gulf of mexico oil spill and the gaza flotilla . <p> this evolution raises big questions about the trade-off between immediacy and accuracy -- or at least perspective . the historian sits down long after the events have occurred with no need to please or flatter the participants to gain access , since most are dead , and the freedom to study a wide variety of sources . a journalist working at high speed has only what he or she witnesses and the details that others -- some with an agenda -- choose to divulge . <p> \" none of us has the right perspective , given how quickly these events unfolded , and we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" says andrew ross sorkin , the new york times journalist and author of too big to fail ( 2009 ) , which reconstructed the climactic events of the 2008 financial crisis in new york and washington . \" if you try to write a great analytical book now , you will either be wrong or lucky . \" <p> lewis says : \" the last thing i want to hold myself out as is as a historian or a prognosticator . i have no clue where this is all going . i am not a wise man , i am a journalist . the historian 's advantage is that he knows how the thing ends . if the eurozone financial crisis ends in war , that 's one story . if it ends with germany owning half of greece , it 's another . \" <p> reporters do have one edge on historians -- they can get to the scene before events fade . el rashidi , who went to tahrir square at the start of the demonstrations , says : \" i did n't step back and think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very aware of feeling that something extraordinary was happening and wanting to share it . you can capture time and the smell and the colour of a place that can not be captured 10 years later . \" <p> william cohan , author of three books about financial institutions -- lazard fr ? res , bear stearns and goldman sachs -- says : \" i find instant histories to be incredibly valuable . you can talk to the people directly involved and you can check what they tell you against documents . email has become a great first draft of history -- it 's immutable . you can not argue with it . \" <p> journalists also dig out things that might otherwise remain undiscovered . cohan says : \" when i was researching lazard , people would hand me stacks of memos that felix rohatyn , a former lazard partner in new york or andr ? meyer , another former senior partner had written and had hoped would be buried and say , ' i knew someone like you would come along one day , so i kept them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because witnesses tend to reshape events over time . \" it is critical to try to do the interviews in as close to real time as possible . i found that the further i got from the event , the worse people 's memory was about detail but the more definite their perspective . they believed they understood it better but they were wrong on facts . \" <p> this human fallibility also applies to historians , lewis argues . \" the advantage of knowing how events ended is double-edged because once you grasp the outcome , you start to arrange the facts to lead to that outcome . knowing the ending can distort your understanding of the middle -- you make it neater . \" <p> but , as snow 's case showed , there is also a price for being on the spot among participants . mao could select a sympathetic biographer because plenty of others wanted to tell his story and access is often bartered by the key figures in contemporary events in return for favourable treatment . journalists , such as bob woodward of the washington post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wars in iraq and afghanistan , have been accused of writing accounts that flatter those who spoke to them most . <p> . . . <p> it is particularly difficult for the reader to tell fact from fiction -- or at least which version of the facts is closest to accuracy -- when journalists attempt to reconstruct events by talking to all the participants off the record and presenting a single version of what happened . that has been woodward 's modus operandi , as well as sorkin 's in too big to fail . <p> sorkin says this criticism is overblown . \" i 'm not convinced that those who co-operate always get better treatment . i know of some people who co-operated with me and probably did n't get the treatment that they imagined . \" but he admits that it makes such accounts harder for the reader or a future historian to analyse and unpack -- they simply have to trust the writer . <p> woodward 's books are rarely disputed by those whose actions and words he records , and sorkin 's was admired on wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suskind , author of confidence men , about economic policy under president barack obama , recently came under fire when three of his subjects , including christina romer , former chairman of the council of economic advisers , claimed to have been misquoted . <p> in principle , the two types of history -- an instant account and the long view -- are complementary . the journalist digs up the ground and tries to uncover facts immediately , and the historian assembles all the available data and adds perspective . rival versions of history may agree on the basic facts but shape them differently to produce varying conclusions . <p> but as contemporary history becomes faster and more partial -- and some versions are written in a style that is hard to prove or disprove -- it may become harder for future historians to gauge its value . the rise of digital media and the sheer deluge of data being recorded by individuals and released by organisations such as wikileaks , raises a further possibility -- that historians will be able to circumvent or to ignore the current accounts and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few letters and historical records , they may have a plethora of real-time digital data to comb through . <p> twitter is only one example of this -- facebook pages , email , and photographs and videos of current events are all recent phenomena . yasmine el rashidi says she watched others in tahrir square holding up their phones . \" they were not writing but you could see they were trying to capture the moment , \" she says . they were , in their own way , competing to stamp their perspective on the event . <p> for now , the book tends to carry more weight than individual tweets , photos , or articles in newspapers and magazines . but that may be a historical anomaly -- the fact that printed books have traditionally been of a certain length and have taken time to assemble and publish . as ebook publishing speeds up , the line between books and extended magazine articles will blur . \" there are people who insist that a book is a narrative form that is transhistorical , \" says colin robinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been defined as what a binding machine is able physically to hold together . if you remove the constraint , you are left with a continuum between a tweet and a tome . \" <p> lewis says : \" because an ebook is a book , it has this authority but , because you can turn it around so quickly , it has the immediacy of a piece of journalism . you are able to attract gravitas to things that were written very recently that you could n't generate before . \" <p> that arbitrage will not last indefinitely . for the moment , anything that is produced by a book publisher is a book , no matter how immediate or distant the events it portrays . but as ebooks get shorter and are published faster , the difference in form will become evident . so too may the differences in value . <p> journalists and historians have always traded off speed against perspective , especially when covering momentous events . whereas journalists accept the challenges of time and space pressure , historians just try to get the story right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billionaire financier 's body in his paris flat , a bullet hole in his heart . journalists pounce and report in real time . several of their bestselling books appear within months . a movie is in theatres soon after . yet historians do not even consider these events until key documents become available decades later . only then do they write about the financier 's schemes and correct the journalists ' early mistakes . <p> this setting looks like today , with instant media reaction and delayed historical treatment . yet the subject was ivar kreuger , the infamous \" match king , \" and the year was 1932 . even then , journalists scrambled to write the first draft of history . earl sparling and william stoneman , two leading journalists who wrote quick biographies of kreuger , were at least as fast as their modern counterparts , and at least as shackled . the definitive account of that era 's mania and crash did not appear until 1954 , with john kenneth galbraith 's the great crash , 1929 . it took even longer for biographers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight

"text": "<p> Strange as it may seem after the backlash over the all-male shortlist for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year , this has been an excellent week for the cause of British women in sport . <p> The issue of the media 's attitude towards female athletes has never been so hotly debated , and the ensuing row has given a voice to the likes of Chrissie Wellington , the four-time ironman triathlon champion , that would never have been heard had she made it on to the 10-strong shortlist only to disappear without trace when it came to the public vote . <p> Remember 2007 when Christine Ohuruogu , fresh from her world 400 metres victory , polled just 0.71 per cent of the public vote to finish 10th and last ? <p> Had Wellington , Rebecca Adlington or Keri-Anne Payne suffered a similar fate by propping up the list of nominees in the live vote , no-one would have batted an eyelid and the male dominance of the sporting agenda would have continued without comment . <p> But the fact they did not even make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the rest of the world -- something the nominated Andy Murray failed to do -- has rightly turned the spotlight on the way women 's sport is viewed by sections of the media and the wider sporting public . <p> As illuminating as the protests by female athletes , sports officials and politicians has been the depressingly blinkered views of some male sports fans who felt motivated to join the debate on internet forums . <p> One of the most repeated comments was that they simply had n't heard of the female athletes who felt so hard done by , with the exception perhaps of double Olympic champion Adlington . <p> Well QED . It is precisely because of their lack of media exposure that news of their world-beating achievements has failed to register with the sports pages-reading public . <p> Either that , or there are some fans who simply ca n't bring themselves to go beyond the football , cricket and rugby pages to the hinterland of general sport . <p> But at least the issue has now been identified and brought into the open . Inadvertently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done female athletes a great service . <p> The debate about women 's place in sport could not be more timely . The coming year offers a wonderful opportunity for female athletes to stand shoulder with their male colleagues and in many cases upstage them . <p> The Olympics are one of the few sporting events where there is no gender inequality , despite the crass attempts by the middle-aged men who sit in charge of world boxing and badminton to create unnecessary distinctions by suggesting that female athletes should be made to wear skirts . The idea has rightly been rubbished . <p> But in terms of how medals are celebrated and reported on by the media , there is no discrimination when it comes to the Olympics or Paralympics . In the equestrian events , men and women even compete for the same medals . <p> In other disciplines , a gold medal is a gold medal , whether it is won by a woman or a man . Few would dispute that the star of the 2004 Athens Olympics from a British point of view was double champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next summer , then she too will surely be the story of the Games . <p> Both Holmes and Radcliffe are former winners of the Sports Personality of the Year award -- Holmes after her Olympic double and Radcliffe two years earlier after breaking the marathon world record for the first time . <p> The chances are that London 2012 will produce another female winner . Victoria Pendleton perhaps , now that she has multiple medal chances in the velodrome , or Jessica Ennis if she can rediscover her heptathlon dominance . Or maybe Katharine Grainger , who is now the favourite to win rowing gold with partner Anna Watkins after taking silver at the last three Games . <p> The bigger question is whether a woman can win the BBC award in a non-Olympic year , but the controversy of the last few days should ensure that , when future shortlists are chosen , our female world-beaters are not so blithely overlooked .

"title": "Great expectations for brand Dickens\n",
"text": "<h> 4/5 <h> 5/5 <p> There is a cartoon of Charles Dickens from 1868 , when he was filling theatre halls to the rafters with the most sensational , most lucrative of book tours across America . He is shown standing with his manager , George Dolby , disgruntled as he counts the skyscraper-high piles of dollar bills on the table , and ruing the fact he has not earned more . <p> The Victorian writer was , by this time , in his commercial stride , a celebrity earning the equivalent of around ? 30,000 a night in a dynamic one-man act in which he regularly knocked out his \" greatest hits \" -- scenes from A Christmas Carol , Oliver Twist and Nell Trent 's death from The Old Curiosity Shop -- to the delight of rapt audiences . This snide , satirising cartoon , that now hangs in the Dickens Museum , reflects how the American press came to see him by the end of the tour -- as an author who did little to hide the sharp commercial voracity that ran alongside his abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dickens brand is as big and as powerful a cultural export as ever , beloved abroad and on the verge of making yet more skyscraper-shaped piles of cash for his bicentenary next year , which coincides with the Olympics and the Queen 's jubilee , and which is being globally marketed alongside these two mammoth events . <p> The Dickens brand will be big business on the home front -- there is a bewildering amount of exhibitions , debates , films and plays launching throughout 2012 , and an equally dazzling array for overseas audiences . The British Library , Museum of London , and British Film Institute have begun early by staging some of their Dickens fare this month . The British Council is hosting events in 50 countries and Dickens 2012 , the umbrella group co-ordinating festivities , anticipates a rewarding return investment . <p> Florian Schweizer , director of the Dickens Museum and Dickens 2012 , explains that , while the latter does not have a central budget , a comparison could be made with the 250th anniversary of Mozart staged in Vienna in 2006 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The budget of ? 21m ( ? 18m ) for the Mozart celebrations in Vienna reaped enormous return dividends through inward tourism -- ? 43m with wider economic production value at ? 300m . The celebrations led to a hike in Austrian GDP and increased employment . <p> \" It 's always difficult to put a value on cultural activity but I can see the Dickens bicentenary being comparable to the Mozart celebrations . Our celebrations will stretch from New York to Zurich to Paris to Toronto . There will be activities in London , Kent and Portsmouth , so it will also stimulate internal tourism . We have the Olympics , the Queen 's jubilee and the Dickens bicentenary named alongside each other as the three key events of 2012 . The three will feed into each other to the point that it will be almost difficult to pull them apart , \" says Schweizer . Dickens would undoubtedly have approved . In his lifetime , he had a strong relationship to the money-making machine around him , however distasteful this may have seemed to the American press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , a clerk in the Navy , spent much of his life overspending , in debt , and imprisoned for it . Dickens aimed to live by the same dictum as the fictional Mr Micawber , who correlated money with happiness in David Copperfield : \" Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six , result happiness . Annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery . \" <p> The young Dickens was hugely insecure about money . He feared his writing would stop appealing to the public and wrote letters in the 1840s citing Sir Walter Scott 's fate ; as a celebrated , wealthy writer of his time , he died without leaving his family financially secure . Juliet John , Professor of Victorian literature at Liverpool University , and author of Dickens and Mass Culture , says he wrote letters about money all the time . \" When he did public readings , which were really PR tours , from the 1850s onwards , he would write to friends literally characterising the audience as pounds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially secure was 1846 , at the age of 34 , when he was no longer at the mercy of debtors nor obliged to his publishers . He had become a classic rags-to-riches story -- his own Pip . By this time , he had children who proved to be as improvident as his father as well as two households to keep -- that of his estranged wife , and his mistress . He fought for copyright in Britain so that his children could receive an income after his death . <p> Alex Werner , curator at the Museum of London , who has co-written Dickens 's Victorian England 1839-1901 , published next week , says his work was so popular that , even before a serialised story was complete , theatre managers were staging full productions with their own endings . \" He got very cross with these unauthorised works . Copyright laws were in their infancy . In America , his work was being published in pirate publications . \" <p> When he went to America for the second time in 1868 , he received a starry welcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his first public speech , he made mention of this , by opening up the touchy subject of international copyright . <p> \" The Americans did n't understand it when the first thing he spoke about was that , if they did n't introduce international copyright , they would never have a literature of their own , and they 'd just steal works ... by the time he left , he was seen as a greedy , money-obsessed person , \" says Schweizer . <p> Victorian Britain did not hold such a cynical view . His public readings were incredible money-spinners but it was clear that he loved being close to his audience and performing for them . A would-be actor , he would put on different voices for characters . <p> So what does the Dickens brand represent now , and why has his work thrived , endured and continued to bring in investment ? <p> For one , he is among the very few literary figures , alongside Shakespeare , whose characters have gained a ubiquity across cultures . He is on school curricula as far afield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" Scrooge \" is used in the Philippines as a noun , as it is in Britain ) , while Robert Douglas-Fairhurst 's new book , Becoming Dickens , lists Dickensian words which have since entered the vocabulary . <p> It could also come down to the flexibility of his fiction , which represents different things to different people . \" Heritage Dickens \" gives us a nostalgic slice of Britain , full of fog and narrow streets . \" Campaigning Dickens \" flags up urban poverty and social injustices that still exist today . <p> \" Even in his own lifetime , he was a genius at presenting different images of himself to different markets . When he spoke to a working men 's institute , he would emphasise his class loyalty . In private letters he would talk of his radicalism but never ... in public , \" says Professor John . <p> Not only do his novels cross class divides , encompassing the lives of servants and masters in the way that Shakespeare did before him , but they cuts across genres -- so within Great Expectations there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , detective and romance narratives , rolled into one . Toby Litt , an author and panellist in a British Council conference in Berlin which will assess Dickens 's relevance today , talks of a \" unique audience that is not subdivided \" . <p> \" His appeal crosses generations . It 's like Harry Potter , written for children and adopted by adults . That 's why he 's still there in popular culture , \" he says . There is a universal kind of \" survival struggle \" at play in many of the stories , he adds . \" His characters are in a world which does not have a welfare state . It 's a world without a safety net and they are facing basic problems of getting enough to eat , finding friendship , staying warm -- basic problems that people around the world still face . \" Despite the harsh social realities , some maintain that it is the fossilised version of London that charms international audiences -- his street urchins and perennially fog-bound urban landscapes provide a definitive , quintessential version of Englishness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says this side of Dickens hit him when a writer from Shanghai came to visit . <p> \" It was her first time here and she wanted to see Dickens 's London . I could n't think of where to take her to show her the mud , fog , narrow lanes and high tenements of his fiction . She ended up in Starbucks , looking for men in bowler hats . On her second visit , I took her to the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub on Fleet Street , a distilled bit of Dickens . \" <p> This is the \" Heritage Dickens \" that Professor John says has helped to transform Dickens into an international tourist phenomenon . The regular costume-drama TV adaptations have aided the fossilisation , she says . \" Very few of them are done in modern dress , in the way you see many Shakespearean adaptations . \" Dickens World , the themed area in Kent that includes a Great Expectations log flume , a Haunted House of Ebenezer Scrooge and a play area called Fagin 's Den , resurrected the debate around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some writers accusing the owners of putting marketability over artistic integrity . <p> Mr Schweizer does not dispute that the three components -- Dickens , Britishness and the 19th century -- have become inseparable to some degree . Yet there is so much more at work in his novels aside from nostalgia , he says . The relevance lies in his description of the urban condition . The Dickens festival in the Netherlands is perhaps the biggest dedicated annual event , with 160,000 people attending , many in period costume . A large number choose to dress up as chimney sweeps and orphans , a reminder of the timeless nature of dispossession and social injustice . \" He was one of the first people to write in an age of modernity as someone witnessing the speeding up of life and travel and communication .

That was my idea of Dickens . I must have been about 13 or 14 when I took a deep breath and got the rather intimidating book , and found it really engaging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was an extraordinary book that I could identify with very much . I found it engaging , exciting and very touching , even if I did n't understand all of it by any means . I skipped over some passages , but as a way into adult literature , it was perfect . There are lots of writers who have influenced me but certainly my love of adult literature was inspired by Dickens and George Orwell , to a certain extent . <p> ' Great Expectations ' is a book that has always stayed with me and of all the authors I love , Dickens has not really influenced my writing but he has stayed with me the longest . <p> I initially said no to adapting ' Great Expectations ' because the David Lean film cast a long shadow . <p> It was also my favourite novel , which was a reason to adapt it , and also a reason not to adapt it . You inevitably immerse yourself in a book when you are adapting . It can become over-familiar and you see its flaws . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I read it again and I was moved by it again . I also sat down to watch the David Lean film after a deep breath , as I had never actually seen it . It was terrific , but the bits it leaves out are not the bits I would leave out . Inevitably , you have to make choices when you adapt , and I felt there was enough material in the book that could justify taking another look at it . <p> I was pretty faithful to the text , but when you adapt , it is a combination of original work and the screenwriters ' view of the book . There are a lot of things that are reported in the novel that you will actually see this time around . <p> Like any Victorian novel , it contains a lot of exposition -- and within that , there are things that happen off stage , which can be put into a film . You see things in this film version that I have not seen in other adaptations , but it is still faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two that Dickens wrote , but it draws on something that is referred to in the book that is not usually seen on screen . <p> There is a strong thriller element to ' Great Expectations ' . There 's a sense towards the end of Pip as a kind of detective . He uncovers the intrigue of Estella 's origin and Miss Havisham 's past . Two thirds of the way into the book , when Magwitch returns , the tone changes to one of danger and secrets revealing themselves , and that 's certainly the case in the last third of the film version . <p> Adapting is more editorial than writing an original screenplay . It 's about what to keep in and what to lose . I found it creative and satisfying to write the screenplay for ' Great Expectations ' . It 's different from writing original material because Dickens has done the hard bit . He created Miss Havisham and Magwitch and structured this wonderful plot . That 's where the genius lies . <p> I read the book ten times before writing the screenplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made notes . I never found myself bored . It is incredibly consistent , with no longueurs or superfluous dialogue . I have always found it moving , even though Dickens is not necessarily celebrated as an emotional or romantic writer . It is touching and heartbreaking . In the end , adapting it did n't ruin my enjoyment of the book at all -- and I did n't fall out of love with it . <p> David Nicholls , who is also the author of the bestseller ' One Day ' , was speaking to Arifa Akbar . The new film of ' Great Expectations ' will be released next year ",
"lower_text": "<h> 4/5 <h> 5/5 <p> there is a cartoon of charles dickens from 1868 , when he was filling theatre halls to the rafters with the most sensational , most lucrative of book tours across america . he is shown standing with his manager , george dolby , disgruntled as he counts the skyscraper-high piles of dollar bills on the table , and ruing the fact he has not earned more . <p> the victorian writer was , by this time , in his commercial stride , a celebrity earning the equivalent of around ? 30,000 a night in a dynamic one-man act in which he regularly knocked out his \" greatest hits \" -- scenes from a christmas carol , oliver twist and nell trent 's death from the old curiosity shop -- to the delight of rapt audiences . this snide , satirising cartoon , that now hangs in the dickens museum , reflects how the american press came to see him by the end of the tour -- as an author who did little to hide the sharp commercial voracity that ran alongside his abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dickens brand is as big and as powerful a cultural export as ever , beloved abroad and on the verge of making yet more skyscraper-shaped piles of cash for his bicentenary next year , which coincides with the olympics and the queen 's jubilee , and which is being globally marketed alongside these two mammoth events . <p> the dickens brand will be big business on the home front -- there is a bewildering amount of exhibitions , debates , films and plays launching throughout 2012 , and an equally dazzling array for overseas audiences . the british library , museum of london , and british film institute have begun early by staging some of their dickens fare this month . the british council is hosting events in 50 countries and dickens 2012 , the umbrella group co-ordinating festivities , anticipates a rewarding return investment . <p> florian schweizer , director of the dickens museum and dickens 2012 , explains that , while the latter does not have a central budget , a comparison could be made with the 250th anniversary of mozart staged in vienna in 2006 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> the budget of ? 21m ( ? 18m ) for the mozart celebrations in vienna reaped enormous return dividends through inward tourism -- ? 43m with wider economic production value at ? 300m . the celebrations led to a hike in austrian gdp and increased employment . <p> \" it 's always difficult to put a value on cultural activity but i can see the dickens bicentenary being comparable to the mozart celebrations . our celebrations will stretch from new york to zurich to paris to toronto . there will be activities in london , kent and portsmouth , so it will also stimulate internal tourism . we have the olympics , the queen 's jubilee and the dickens bicentenary named alongside each other as the three key events of 2012 . the three will feed into each other to the point that it will be almost difficult to pull them apart , \" says schweizer . dickens would undoubtedly have approved . in his lifetime , he had a strong relationship to the money-making machine around him , however distasteful this may have seemed to the american press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , a clerk in the navy , spent much of his life overspending , in debt , and imprisoned for it . dickens aimed to live by the same dictum as the fictional mr micawber , who correlated money with happiness in david copperfield : \" annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six , result happiness . annual income twenty pounds , annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six , result misery . \" <p> the young dickens was hugely insecure about money . he feared his writing would stop appealing to the public and wrote letters in the 1840s citing sir walter scott 's fate ; as a celebrated , wealthy writer of his time , he died without leaving his family financially secure . juliet john , professor of victorian literature at liverpool university , and author of dickens and mass culture , says he wrote letters about money all the time . \" when he did public readings , which were really pr tours , from the 1850s onwards , he would write to friends literally characterising the audience as pounds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially secure was 1846 , at the age of 34 , when he was no longer at the mercy of debtors nor obliged to his publishers . he had become a classic rags-to-riches story -- his own pip . by this time , he had children who proved to be as improvident as his father as well as two households to keep -- that of his estranged wife , and his mistress . he fought for copyright in britain so that his children could receive an income after his death . <p> alex werner , curator at the museum of london , who has co-written dickens 's victorian england 1839-1901 , published next week , says his work was so popular that , even before a serialised story was complete , theatre managers were staging full productions with their own endings . \" he got very cross with these unauthorised works . copyright laws were in their infancy . in america , his work was being published in pirate publications . \" <p> when he went to america for the second time in 1868 , he received a starry welcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in his first public speech , he made mention of this , by opening up the touchy subject of international copyright . <p> \" the americans did n't understand it when the first thing he spoke about was that , if they did n't introduce international copyright , they would never have a literature of their own , and they 'd just steal works ... by the time he left , he was seen as a greedy , money-obsessed person , \" says schweizer . <p> victorian britain did not hold such a cynical view . his public readings were incredible money-spinners but it was clear that he loved being close to his audience and performing for them . a would-be actor , he would put on different voices for characters . <p> so what does the dickens brand represent now , and why has his work thrived , endured and continued to bring in investment ? <p> for one , he is among the very few literary figures , alongside shakespeare , whose characters have gained a ubiquity across cultures . he is on school curricula as far afield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" scrooge \" is used in the philippines as a noun , as it is in britain ) , while robert douglas-fairhurst 's new book , becoming dickens , lists dickensian words which have since entered the vocabulary . <p> it could also come down to the flexibility of his fiction , which represents different things to different people . \" heritage dickens \" gives us a nostalgic slice of britain , full of fog and narrow streets . \" campaigning dickens \" flags up urban poverty and social injustices that still exist today . <p> \" even in his own lifetime , he was a genius at presenting different images of himself to different markets . when he spoke to a working men 's institute , he would emphasise his class loyalty . in private letters he would talk of his radicalism but never ... in public , \" says professor john . <p> not only do his novels cross class divides , encompassing the lives of servants and masters in the way that shakespeare did before him , but they cuts across genres -- so within great expectations there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , detective and romance narratives , rolled into one . toby litt , an author and panellist in a british council conference in berlin which will assess dickens 's relevance today , talks of a \" unique audience that is not subdivided \" . <p> \" his appeal crosses generations . it 's like harry potter , written for children and adopted by adults . that 's why he 's still there in popular culture , \" he says . there is a universal kind of \" survival struggle \" at play in many of the stories , he adds . \" his characters are in a world which does not have a welfare state . it 's a world without a safety net and they are facing basic problems of getting enough to eat , finding friendship , staying warm -- basic problems that people around the world still face . \" despite the harsh social realities , some maintain that it is the fossilised version of london that charms international audiences -- his street urchins and perennially fog-bound urban landscapes provide a definitive , quintessential version of englishness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says this side of dickens hit him when a writer from shanghai came to visit . <p> \" it was her first time here and she wanted to see dickens 's london . i could n't think of where to take her to show her the mud , fog , narrow lanes and high tenements of his fiction . she ended up in starbucks , looking for men in bowler hats . on her second visit , i took her to the ye olde cheshire cheese pub on fleet street , a distilled bit of dickens . \" <p> this is the \" heritage dickens \" that professor john says has helped to transform dickens into an international tourist phenomenon . the regular costume-drama tv adaptations have aided the fossilisation , she says . \" very few of them are done in modern dress , in the way you see many shakespearean adaptations . \" dickens world , the themed area in kent that includes a great expectations log flume , a haunted house of ebenezer scrooge and a play area called fagin 's den , resurrected the debate around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some writers accusing the owners of putting marketability over artistic integrity . <p> mr schweizer does not dispute that the three components -- dickens , britishness and the 19th century -- have become inseparable to some degree . yet there is so much more at work in his novels aside from nostalgia , he says . the relevance lies in his description of the urban condition . the dickens festival in the netherlands is perhaps the biggest dedicated annual event , with 160,000 people attending , many in period costume . a large number choose to dress up as chimney sweeps and orphans , a reminder of the timeless nature of dispossession and social injustice . \" he was one of the first people to write in an age of modernity as someone witnessing the speeding up of life and travel and communication . dickens 's england is one we can relate to , \" says schweizer . <p> werner offers the same explanation for his international

The researchers scanned the brains of 150 adolescent boys with internet game disorder <p> The findings could help researchers who are hoping to explore the impact that spending excessive amounts of time in front of a screen can have on youngsters . <h> Share this article <p> Many leading neuroscientists , including Baroness Susan Greenfield at Oxford University , have expressed concern at the impact of computer games and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neuroradiologist at the University of Utah 's school of medicine who led the latest study , said : ' Most of the differences we see could be considered beneficial . <h> SCRABBLE GIVES BRAINS A BOOST <p> If losing at Scrabble every Christmas makes you want to flip the board over in a rage , you might want to squeeze some practice in quickly . <p> Scientists have found that experienced Scrabble players use different parts of their brains than everyday players - particularly those associated with working memory and visual perception . <p> This helps them form words from the letter tiles quickly and developing this ability could boost your game scores and change the way you use your brain , Canadian researchers explained . <p> Competitive Scrabble players devote considerable time to studying words and practising word game-related skills such as anagramming - rearranging letters to make words - according to the study , published in the Elsevier journal Cortex . <p> To investigate the neural consequences of these skills , researchers from the University of Calgary compared the brain activity and connectivity in 12 Scrabble experts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However the good changes could be inseparable from problems that come with them .

"title": "England must put Alastair Cook out of his misery\n",
"text": "<h> If Peter Moores and Paul Downton care about England 's World Cup chances they must make one simple decision : remove Alastair Cook as ODI captain <p> Removing Alastair Cook as captain of the England one-day team just short of a World Cup would not be a gamble . It is a straightforward decision , certainly not the big deal people are making out , and would be in the best interests of the England team as well Cook himself . <p> I feel like a stuck record and this is not about saying \" I told you so \" . In fact this is not aimed at Cook . <p> It is aimed at the two men running English cricket : Peter Moores and Paul Downton . In one way I applaud them for sticking by their man but it has gone too far and 99.9 per cent of England supporters , as well as current and former players , can see that . The problem is the 0.1 per cent , which is Downton and Moores , do not see it . <p> It startles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a better standard , which has been to win just one of his last nine ODI series . That is a very worrying sign of how Moores and Downton judge the rest of the group . <p> Downton has said he will sit in on England 's selection meeting on Friday - why ? Is it at the request of Moores because he thinks he will need backing up in case the other selectors argue for Cook to go ? Downton is not a selector . He should not be there . <h> Related Articles <p> Ok he does not have a vote but he is the boss of Angus Fraser , Mick Newell and James Whitaker . They have seen from his interviews this week that Paul is backing Cook as captain . <p> The selectors who have not been in Sri Lanka need to have an honest discussion about the best way forward and how England can compete at the World Cup . Having Downton in the room will stifle that debate . How can a selector raise his objections when he knows his boss has already backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just four selectors and four walls . That way they can make the best decision for English cricket . I always say look in the mirror . As a selector ask yourself is Cook one of the best 15 one-day players in England ? I think he 's not in the top 30 . <p> Cook has to do the same by asking himself if he 's doing best thing for the team by hanging around . If he genuinely believes he is , then carry on but if he thinks England are better without him , then step aside . <p> Ultimately it should be a straightforward move . If they sack Cook on Friday it will not have a big impact on the team . It will not set the side back or fundamentally change the team 's approach to one day cricket . <p> But it would put a frazzled Cook out of his misery , allow him to concentrate on Test cricket and winning the back the Ashes in July . It would also allow England to pick their best team and not have to continually move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last 22 matches . <p> Using his record in Australia as a reason for sticking with him is hanging a hat on a peg that does not exist . In one-day cricket in Australia and New Zealand Cook averages 35 with strike rate of 73 . Hardly starting and does not fit this modern era . <p> Last winter he struggled against Australians bowling full outside a fourth stump . Teams have worked out not to bowl short at Cook . They also bowl spin in one-day cricket . He plants his front foot , using a big forward press , which is fine in Test cricket because it helps you defend , but in one-day cricket it makes you static . You ca n't move again and force the bowler to change his length . The best players of spin use their feet so they can sweep and cut . Cook ca n't do that . He is stationary so it is easy to bowl at him and set fields meaning he will always chew up balls . <p> He must be exhausted by all the criticism . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform . You are not unlucky . It is because you are not scoring runs . <p> A golfing analogy sums up where England are at with Cook . When a smart golfer hits the ball into a bush he takes his medicine , hits it out sideways and walks off with a bogey or double bogey but is still in the tournament . A desperate golfer goes for the magic shot , flaps away and keeps thrashing making things worse . He shoots a 10 or 11 and has missed the cut . England are that desperate golfer thrashing around in the bush . <p> But if they take their medicine and move on then there is hope because England have some very talented players and Eoin Morgan can step in as captain . <p> I know he is not in great form . But Morgan 's highest score last summer was when he captained England in a Twenty20 . His best innings on this trip was when he was in charge too . He clearly likes leadership . <p> There have been positives on this trip . Moeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James Taylor has batted smartly at three and Joe Root has shown outstanding maturity and calmness in the middle order . Chris Woakes has improved and Ravi Bopara has had a good tour too which is why I thought it was staggering he was dropped for the final game . <p> England need his bowling . They lack an X-factor fast bowler or mystery spinner so they need clever bowlers who can mix up their pace like Ravi . Why Cook gave him just 15 overs in five matches is a mystery . <p> With Stuart Broad and James Anderson to come into the side England have a chance of surprising a few people in Australia . But only if they make one simple decision over the next few days . ",
"lower_text": "<h> if peter moores and paul downton care about england 's world cup chances they must make one simple decision : remove alastair cook as odi captain <p> removing alastair cook as captain of the england one-day team just short of a world cup would not be a gamble . it is a straightforward decision , certainly not the big deal people are making out , and would be in the best interests of the england team as well cook himself . <p> i feel like a stuck record and this is not about saying \" i told you so \" . in fact this is not aimed at cook . <p> it is aimed at the two men running english cricket : peter moores and paul downton . in one way i applaud them for sticking by their man but it has gone too far and 99.9 per cent of england supporters , as well as current and former players , can see that . the problem is the 0.1 per cent , which is downton and moores , do not see it . <p> it startles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a better standard , which has been to win just one of his last nine odi series . that is a very worrying sign of how moores and downton judge the rest of the group . <p> downton has said he will sit in on england 's selection meeting on friday - why ? is it at the request of moores because he thinks he will need backing up in case the other selectors argue for cook to go ? downton is not a selector . he should not be there . <h> related articles <p> ok he does not have a vote but he is the boss of angus fraser , mick newell and james whitaker . they have seen from his interviews this week that paul is backing cook as captain . <p> the selectors who have not been in sri lanka need to have an honest discussion about the best way forward and how england can compete at the world cup . having downton in the room will stifle that debate . how can a selector raise his objections when he knows his boss has already backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just four selectors and four walls . that way they can make the best decision for english cricket . i always say look in the mirror . as a selector ask yourself is cook one of the best 15 one-day players in england ? i think he 's not in the top 30 . <p> cook has to do the same by asking himself if he 's doing best thing for the team by hanging around . if he genuinely believes he is , then carry on but if he thinks england are better without him , then step aside . <p> ultimately it should be a straightforward move . if they sack cook on friday it will not have a big impact on the team . it will not set the side back or fundamentally change the team 's approach to one day cricket . <p> but it would put a frazzled cook out of his misery , allow him to concentrate on test cricket and winning the back the ashes in july . it would also allow england to pick their best team and not have to continually move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last 22 matches . <p> using his record in australia as a reason for sticking with him is hanging a hat on a peg that does not exist . in one-day cricket in australia and new zealand cook averages 35 with strike rate of 73 . hardly starting and does not fit this modern era . <p> last winter he struggled against australians bowling full outside a fourth stump . teams have worked out not to bowl short at cook . they also bowl spin in one-day cricket . he plants his front foot , using a big forward press , which is fine in test cricket because it helps you defend , but in one-day cricket it makes you static . you ca n't move again and force the bowler to change his length . the best players of spin use their feet so they can sweep and cut . cook ca n't do that . he is stationary so it is easy to bowl at him and set fields meaning he will always chew up balls . <p> he must be exhausted by all the criticism . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform . you are not unlucky . it is because you are not scoring runs . <p> a golfing analogy sums up where england are at with cook . when a smart golfer hits the ball into a bush he takes his medicine , hits it out sideways and walks off with a bogey or double bogey but is still in the tournament . a desperate golfer goes for the magic shot , flaps away and keeps thrashing making things worse . he shoots a 10 or 11 and has missed the cut . england are that desperate golfer thrashing around in the bush . <p> but if they take their medicine and move on then there is hope because england have some very talented players and eoin morgan can step in as captain . <p> i know he is not in great form . but morgan 's highest score last summer was when he captained england in a twenty20 . his best innings on this trip was when he was in charge too . he clearly likes leadership . <p> there have been positives on this trip . moeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . james taylor has batted smartly at three and joe root has shown outstanding maturity and calmness in the middle order . chris woakes has improved and ravi bopara has had a good tour too which is why i thought it was staggering he was dropped for the final game . <p> england need his bowling . they lack an x-factor fast bowler or mystery spinner so they need clever bowlers who can mix up their pace like ravi . why cook gave him just 15 overs in five matches is a mystery . <p> with stuart broad and james anderson to come into the side england have a chance of surprising a few people in australia . but only if they make one simple decision over the next few days .

"text": "<h> The biggest disappointments of 2014 <p> We 've had enough of talking about everything that 's been good this year , now it 's time to focus on the things that have n't been so great . <p> As with every year , the last 12 months has seen some disappointments in the world of tech , with unfulfilled hopes and dashed dreams cropping up every now and then to keep us on our toes . <p> But do n't just take my word for it , here 's what our all-knowing writers thought were some of the biggest disappointments of 2014 . <h> No new cheap Nexus -- Jamie Hinks <p> As a Google Android phone owner , it would be very easy to reserve this section for Apple 's \" groundbreaking \" iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices that do much of what the likes of Samsung and HTC have been doing well for some time . <p> That 's too simple and nowhere near as disappointing as Google 's decision to stop bringing out low-priced Nexus smartphones with high-end specs and instead hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other years Google has released the Nexus 4 and 5 that have both been at the sub- ? 300 price point and the fact they are Google 's own smartphones meant that they were the first to receive Android updates . <p> Now the only option on the table is to buy last year 's Nexus 5 ( which is often out of stock ) or hit eBay . <p> The other choice for those of us that want one of the latest handsets with stock Android is to invest in the Motorola 's Moto X Pure Edition , which brings the Nexus 6 specs into a device without a phablet-sized screen . <h> Apple Watch at 12 O'Clock -- Darren Allen <p> The biggest disappointment for me this year was Apple 's \" next big thing \" , the Apple Watch , which was unveiled back in September . <p> I was expecting great things from Apple with this gadget . The firm 's iPad is on the slide , and we 've seen nothing truly new since , well , the iPad -- just new versions of iPhones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unveiling , my first impressions were that Apple 's smartwatch does n't look as attractive as I thought it might .

Harry Loach created history on Saturday 10th January 1885 by grabbing his first of two goals against Aston Villa in the Third Round replay tie at Stoney Lane in the 3-0 win . <p> Jem Bayliss scored Albion 's third and final goal , setting up a Fourth Round home tie with Druids . The Baggies were eventually knocked out of the FA Cup in the quarter -- final tie with Blackburn Rovers . <p> The following season , Albion received a bye in the Third Round before making their first of ten appearances in the final of the FA Cup against Blackburn Rovers . The game ended in a goalless draw at The Oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 1886 . <p> The mighty Baggies finally lifted the trophy at the third attempt in 1888 defeating Preston North End at the Oval 2-1 on Saturday 24th March at The Oval in front of 18 , 904 spectators . Jem Bayliss and George ' Spry ' Woodhall were Albion 's goal heroes . <p> Albion 's biggest win in the Third Round of the FA Cup came in 1889 with a 10-1 thumping of Chatham on Saturday 2nd March . Amongst the goals were Billy Bassett ( 2 ) , John Perry , a hat trick for Charlie Wilson , Bayliss ( 2 ) , George Timmins and an own goal from Conquer . <p> Another big win in the Third Round stage occurred in 1937 with a 7-1 win against Spennymoor United at The Hawthorns . Albion 's opponents played in the North Eastern League and hailed from County Durham . Goals from Teddy Sandford ( 2 ) , W.G. Richardson ( 2 ) , Stan Wood , Jones and Mahon secured the 7-1 victory in front of 23,746 spectators . <p> The Throstles have registered a 5-1 victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones , Williams , Clarke and Richardson were on the mark at The Hawthorns on Saturday 11th January , 1939 , to post a 5-1 win against Manchester United in the Third Round replay . <p> Nineteen years later , in 1958 , Albion registered another 5-1 win against Manchester City at The Hawthorns on Saturday 4th January . A bumper crowd of 49,669 saw Ronnie Allen score a brace , in addition to goals from Frank Griffin , Ray Barlow and a Ewing own goal . <p> Just as Beatlemania gripped the nation in 1963 , Archie Macaulay 's side travelled to Home Park to face Plymouth Argyle from Division Two in the Third Round of the FA Cup .

"text": "<h> Recent Articles <p> Nobody could accuse India 's telecoms regulator , TRAI , of being in the operators ' pockets . This month it has , once again , set eye-watering reserve prices for the upcoming 700 MHz spectrum auction ( see separate item ) , and now it has taken one of the toughest stances in the world on net neutrality , in effect banning zero rated or discounted content deals like Reliance Communications ' Facebook Basics , or Bharti Airtel 's Zero . <p> In a ruling last Monday , TRAI said telecoms providers are banned from offering discriminatory tariffs for data services based on content , and from entering deals to subsidize access to certain websites . They have six months to wind down any existing arrangements which contravene the new rules . Its stance is even stricter than in other countries with strong pro-neutrality laws , such as Brazil and The Netherlands . <p> \" This is the most extensive and stringent regulation on differential pricing anywhere in the world , \" Pranesh Prakash , policy director at the Centre for Internet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of complete ban have clearly lost . \" <p> Such decisions , combined with high spectrum costs , will quickly make the traditional cellular business model unworkable in India , and the more that happens , the more wireless internet innovation will switch to open networks running on Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum . R.S. Sharma , chairman of TRAI , was careful to tell reporters that the zero rating ruling would not affect any plans to offer free Wi-Fi services , like those planned by Google in a venture with Indian Railways . <h> A disaster for MNOs , not Facebook <p> Facebook pronounced itself \" disappointed \" at TRAI 's ruling , having lobbied aggressively for a more flexible approach since RCOM was forced to suspend the Basics offering in December while the consultation process took place . But while the ruling bars the Basics offering -- which provided free , low speed access , on RCOM 's network , to a selection of websites , curated by Facebook -- it does not stop the social media giant pursuing other initiatives within its internet.org umbrella . These include projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drones and unlicensed spectrum , to the unserved of India and other emerging economies . <p> So while the TRAI decision may be a setback for Facebook , it is not the body blow that it represents for the MNOs with their huge debt loads and infrastructure costs , and low ARPUs . Facebook , with 130m users in India , has a comparable reach to the Indian MNOs ( only three , Bharti Airtel , Vodafone and Idea , have more subscribers than Facebook has users ) , and is better skilled at monetizing those consumers . <p> The challenge for companies like Facebook is that strict neutrality rules reduce their ability to harness others ' networks in order to reach out to new users . There are about 240m people in India who are online , but do n't use Facebook , and about 800m who are not connected , so the growth potential is far larger than in the other 37 countries where Basics is offered , such as Kenya or Zambia ( Facebook is blocked in China ) . Using RCOM 's network and marketing activities was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than launching drones , but Facebook has other options too , including its existing efforts to make its services more usable on very basic handsets and connections ; the ability to leverage the WhatsApp brand ; and partnerships with Wi-Fi providers . <p> The drones may have less immediate results than Basics , but they are a high profile example of an ongoing shift towards open networks , which has been going on for years , driven more by Wi-Fi proliferation than neutrality laws . The latter will be an accelerant , however . <h> All internet will be free , not zero rated <p> Currently , zero rating is an increasingly popular tactic to lure users with an apparently cheap deal and then , hopefully , see them upgrade to richer data plans , or spend money on m-commerce and premium content , in future . Zero rating involves allowing users access to selected websites and services without it affecting their data caps or allowances . <p> The US regulator has so far tolerated the practice , but the debate is raging , there and elsewhere , over whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet services . If other authorities take the stance adopted by TRAI in India , operators will have to find new ways to attract customers and differentiate themselves . <p> Increasingly , access to a truly open internet will be the baseline , and priced extremely low . That low pricing will be made commercially viable by rising use of Wi-Fi to reduce cost of data delivery , whether for MNOs , wireline providers or web players like Google and Facebook , which are moving into access provision . Providers , whether traditional or new , will have to stop regarding access to the internet as a premium service or a privilege -- it will be more akin to connecting someone to the electricity grid , just the base enabler of the real revenue model . <p> Just as it 's only when users plug something into that grid that they start to pay fees , so the operators will charge for higher value offerings which ride on top of the internet -- premium content , enterprise services , cloud storage , freemium applications and so on . <p> The mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ability to access the internet from a mobile device was regarded as a value-add , almost a miracle . Now that the wireless network is often the primary access method , they need to change their ideas and be more like the smarter cablecos -- which have tacked internet access onto a model driven by paid-for content and services -- or the web giants , which have worked out ways to monetize ' free ' access , from advertising to big data . <p> This , of course , is one of the goals of internet.org and Google 's similar initiatives involving drones , white space spectrum and satellites . The more users are able to access the internet , preferably for free , and the more they see Google or Facebook as their primary conduits to the web , the more data these companies have to feed into their deep learning platforms , their context aware services and their advertising and big data engines . <p> So while critics of TRAI said the zero rating decision was a setback to the goal of getting internet access into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population is too large and potentially rich for Facebook and its rivals to give up at the first hurdle . <p> Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post : \" While we 're disappointed with today 's decision , I want to personally communicate that we are committed to keep working to break down barriers to connectivity in India and around the world . Internet.org has many initiatives , and we will keep working until everyone has access to the internet. \" ",

"text": "<h> US election 2016 : Day one of the Republican civil war <p> Well , that 's it then . The Republican Party has come unglued . It 's been a long time in the making , but the day of reckoning is finally here . <p> For decades there 's been an uneasy alliance between the various factions within the Republican Party . The business interests have joined with social conservatives and economic populists to form a governing coalition . <p> At least it was a governing coalition before Barack Obama won two straight presidential races and fashioned an electorate made up of the young , minorities and women that has significantly tilted the playing field toward Democrats for the foreseeable future . <p> While thanks to population distribution and electoral district map-making Republicans seem secure in their hold on the US Congress , Mr Obama has proven that the power of the presidency matters most . Presented with this frustration , the Republican Party is tearing itself asunder . <p> Donald Trump is leading a movement of populists and some disaffected evangelicals against the reigning establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . What once seemed to be an impossible feat could , with sweeping wins in primary contests over the next two weeks , become a new , very different reality . <p> All this was laid bare in a series of remarkable events over the last 24 hours . <p> Image copyrightGetty Images <h> Republican debate - shots fired <p> The big question going into Thursday night 's Republican debate in Houston was whether , with their backs to the wall , Mr Trump 's two main challengers would launch a full-scale assault on the frontrunner . <p> Within the first few minutes it became clear that they would . Marco Rubio tore into the New Yorker 's business record . Ted Cruz questioned his conservative credentials . Both mocked his lack of policy details . The blows came fast and hard . <p> This was not the first time a presidential competitor had gone after Mr Trump of course . But up until now the attacks had always come from the desperate margins . <p> In July former Texas Governor Rick Perry called Mr Trump a \" cancer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . <p> Then Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal went after the New Yorker , labelling him a narcissist and an egomaniac who was \" full of foolishness and nonsense \" . He suspended his campaign in November . <p> Jeb Bush was the next to make an attack run , tweeting earlier this month that the billionaire was a liar , a loser and a whiner . Last Saturday Mr Bush 's presidential quest ended . <p> Now the fusillade against Trump is coming from the men standing next to him on the debate stage . There are no desperate margins anymore . The desperation has reached all the way to the top . <p> Media captionTrump mocks Rubio 's water cravings <h> A new kind of war <p> As he has when confronted with attacks in the past , Mr Trump launched a storm the following day against his aggressors . <p> He tweeted that Mr Rubio was a lightweight and Mr Cruz was a liar . He said the Floridian \" looks like a little boy on the stage \" and the Texan is a \" nasty guy \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said that Mr Rubio was a \" nervous basket case \" who \" was putting on makeup with a trowel \" . <p> The difference this time , though , is that Mr Rubio is responding in kind . Gone is the noble , high-spirited talk of his humble beginnings and desire to launch a \" new American century \" . Instead Mr Rubio 's rallies on Friday seemed more like a late-night stand-up comedy act . <p> Mr Rubio read Mr Trump 's tweets and mocked his typos . <p> \" Is that how they spell ' choker ' at the Wharton School of Business ? \" he quipped . He called Mr Trump a \" con man \" who \" spent a career in business sticking it to the little guys . \" <p> He even said that Mr Trump was powdering his \" sweat moustache \" during breaks at the debate and had requested a full-length mirror , maybe \" to check if his pants were wet \" . <p> For months Mr Trump has been operating on a different rhetorical level than his presidential opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds that he thinks the whole US political process is a reality-TV joke - and he , for one , is going to let them in on it . <p> Meanwhile serious politicians gave serious speeches , and Mr Trump ate them alive , one by one . <p> On Friday Mr Rubio decided to play the game by Mr Trump 's rules . At this point , however , the New Yorker may have an insurmountable head start . <p> Image copyrightGetty Images <h> The Christie dilemma <p> The biggest bombshell of the past 24 hours came when Mr Trump took the stage in Dallas on Friday morning , flanked by former Republican adversary Chris Christie . <p> The New Jersey governor 's endorsement marks a turning point in the Republican nomination fight . Up until now Mr Rubio has dominated the establishment endorsement battle . Mr Trump 's allies were a collection of political has-beens and fringe personalities . <p> Mr Christie , however , is as establishment as they come . He 's the former head of the powerful Republican Governors Association . He was the keynote speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's impossible to characterise Mr Trump as a hostile outside force anymore . Mr Trump 's scary political phone calls are coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE . <p> If they all stick together , there 's a chance they could prevent Mr Trump from winning the nomination . But the benefits of breaking from the pack and supporting the New Yorker now may be too tempting to resist . <p> By being one of the first to endorse Mr Christie grabs a front seat in Mr Trump 's new Republican order . Expect others to follow , as Maine Governor Paul LePage did later on Friday . <h> And now what ? <p> So is this the beginning or the end ?

"lower_text": "<h> us election 2016 : day one of the republican civil war <p> well , that 's it then . the republican party has come unglued . it 's been a long time in the making , but the day of reckoning is finally here . <p> for decades there 's been an uneasy alliance between the various factions within the republican party . the business interests have joined with social conservatives and economic populists to form a governing coalition . <p> at least it was a governing coalition before barack obama won two straight presidential races and fashioned an electorate made up of the young , minorities and women that has significantly tilted the playing field toward democrats for the foreseeable future . <p> while thanks to population distribution and electoral district map-making republicans seem secure in their hold on the us congress , mr obama has proven that the power of the presidency matters most . presented with this frustration , the republican party is tearing itself asunder . <p> donald trump is leading a movement of populists and some disaffected evangelicals against the reigning establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . what once seemed to be an impossible feat could , with sweeping wins in primary contests over the next two weeks , become a new , very different reality . <p> all this was laid bare in a series of remarkable events over the last 24 hours . <p> image copyrightgetty images <h> republican debate - shots fired <p> the big question going into thursday night 's republican debate in houston was whether , with their backs to the wall , mr trump 's two main challengers would launch a full-scale assault on the frontrunner . <p> within the first few minutes it became clear that they would . marco rubio tore into the new yorker 's business record . ted cruz questioned his conservative credentials . both mocked his lack of policy details . the blows came fast and hard . <p> this was not the first time a presidential competitor had gone after mr trump of course . but up until now the attacks had always come from the desperate margins . <p> in july former texas governor rick perry called mr trump a \" cancer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . <p> then louisiana governor bobby jindal went after the new yorker , labelling him a narcissist and an egomaniac who was \" full of foolishness and nonsense \" . he suspended his campaign in november . <p> jeb bush was the next to make an attack run , tweeting earlier this month that the billionaire was a liar , a loser and a whiner . last saturday mr bush 's presidential quest ended . <p> now the fusillade against trump is coming from the men standing next to him on the debate stage . there are no desperate margins anymore . the desperation has reached all the way to the top . <p> media captiontrump mocks rubio 's water cravings <h> a new kind of war <p> as he has when confronted with attacks in the past , mr trump launched a storm the following day against his aggressors . <p> he tweeted that mr rubio was a lightweight and mr cruz was a liar . he said the floridian \" looks like a little boy on the stage \" and the texan is a \" nasty guy \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he said that mr rubio was a \" nervous basket case \" who \" was putting on makeup with a trowel \" . <p> the difference this time , though , is that mr rubio is responding in kind . gone is the noble , high-spirited talk of his humble beginnings and desire to launch a \" new american century \" . instead mr rubio 's rallies on friday seemed more like a late-night stand-up comedy act . <p> mr rubio read mr trump 's tweets and mocked his typos . <p> \" is that how they spell ' choker ' at the wharton school of business ? \" he quipped . he called mr trump a \" con man \" who \" spent a career in business sticking it to the little guys . \" <p> he even said that mr trump was powdering his \" sweat moustache \" during breaks at the debate and had requested a full-length mirror , maybe \" to check if his pants were wet \" . <p> for months mr trump has been operating on a different rhetorical level than his presidential opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds that he thinks the whole us political process is a reality-tv joke - and he , for one , is going to let them in on it . <p> meanwhile serious politicians gave serious speeches , and mr trump ate them alive , one by one . <p> on friday mr rubio decided to play the game by mr trump 's rules . at this point , however , the new yorker may have an insurmountable head start . <p> image copyrightgetty images <h> the christie dilemma <p> the biggest bombshell of the past 24 hours came when mr trump took the stage in dallas on friday morning , flanked by former republican adversary chris christie . <p> the new jersey governor 's endorsement marks a turning point in the republican nomination fight . up until now mr rubio has dominated the establishment endorsement battle . mr trump 's allies were a collection of political has-beens and fringe personalities . <p> mr christie , however , is as establishment as they come . he 's the former head of the powerful republican governors association . he was the keynote speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's impossible to characterise mr trump as a hostile outside force anymore . mr trump 's scary political phone calls are coming from inside the house . <p> if they all stick together , there 's a chance they could prevent mr trump from winning the nomination . but the benefits of breaking from the pack and supporting the new yorker now may be too tempting to resist . <p> by being one of the first to endorse mr christie grabs a front seat in mr trump 's new republican order . expect others to follow , as maine governor paul lepage did later on friday . <h> and now what ? <p> so is this the beginning or the end ? will mr trump and his new band of supporters take over the republican party ? <p> the next few weeks will tell us a great deal , as his competitors - mr cruz , mr rubio and ohio governor john kasich - all face tough tests in primaries in their home states . <p> if any of them lose they will likely be knocked out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nomination . <p> then it 's a question of whether the party will fall in line behind their new leader or fight a rearguard battle to the last man . <p> some republicans do n't appear eager to go gently into the night . <p> \" my party has gone crazy , \" south carolina senator lindsey graham , himself a former republican presidential hopeful , said at a congressional dinner thursday night , punctuating the line with an expletive . <p> on friday rubio fashioned it as a battle for the heart and soul of the republican party . <p> \" the republican party would be split apart if he became the nominee , \" rubio said . \" we can not allow the party of reagan to be taken over by a con man . \" <p> a civil war is brewing within the republican ranks - and the bloodshed has only just begun .

"title": "Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's life was one of maniacal productivity ...\n",
"text": "<p> He explained that he had \" popped down to London for some chemo \" , and had noticed this interesting concert of music by young composers was on . He was wearing a knitted waist-coat of a kind which used to be called ' snazzy ' , given to him by an admirer some years back , and though he was grey with fatigue he seemed almost his old self . <p> The quiet fortitude and undimmed curiosity of this mortally ill man were amazing , but sheer strength of character had always been one of Maxwell Davies 's chief traits . His life was one of almost maniacal productivity , so great that he needed several publishers just to cope with the flow . <p> He wrote his opera the Doctor of Myddfai in a mere six weeks , pausing only to eat and sleep . In his middle years he lived a life of seemingly monk-like austerity on a remote Orkney island , where he had to draw his water from a well and walk several miles to buy a pint of milk ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boyfriends at that Orkney fastness , and guests discovered he cooked wonderful pasta dishes , a skill he learned during his student days in Rome in the 1950s ) . <p> Alongside the quiet determination and fluty , slightly vicar-ish punctiliousness of speech went an exquisite courtesy . He was quite often a guest on my magazine show on BBC Radio 3 in the 1990s , and I was struck by how he extended this courtesy to everyone equally , whether it was the distinguished professor in the studio , or the PA who brought his tea . <p> Another memory is of Sir Peter in Orkney , where he created a wonderful annual festival which still continues , and also wrote many of the children 's works which are one of his chief claims to fame . <p> One year I was approaching St Magnus Cathedral for a concert , and at a distance I caught a glimpse of some elderly worthies standing at the entrance , all wearing the same jackets and ties , all caught in the setting son . They looked like members of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them turned out to be Sir Peter . <p> Like Richard Hoggart and David Hockney , he was a lower-middle-class Northern boy made good . That 's why he was so determined to pass on the values of high culture to the next generation . <p> It 's hard to square this sight with my early memories of Maxwell Davies conducting his group The Fires of London , when he wore flower-power shirts , knitted ponchos and red shoes , and had a mop of curly hair as unruly as the young Simon Rattle 's . <p> Only a few years previously his St Thomas Wake : Foxtrot for Orchestra had caused a scandal when it was performed at the Proms , and even more so in Germany . The most notorious of these early works was Eight Songs for a Mad King , which evoked the madness of King George III in an expressionist style of nerve-shredding intensity . <p> It 's easy to say that he simply turned from radical youngster to conservative , but the steely blue eyes and determined jaw of the old man showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger in him , which spilled over briefly in the satirical fury of those works of the 1960s and early 1970s . <p> Religion was often the target , and yet he revered Latin Christian culture of the Middle Ages , and drew on it all his life . In later life he seemed to become reconciled to the church , and even wrote some liturgical pieces . The satirical edge mostly vanished , as the tremendous calm landscape of Orkney , his adopted home , and his increasing immersion in the classical tradition of music brought a kind of peace . The anger still blazed up occasionally , but it had turned political . In the 1970s he wrote a satirical Yellow Cake Review , aimed at the uranium mining companies who were all set to invade Orkney , and in my last interview with him he raged against the Iraq War , a topic which he wove into the 9th Symphony . <p> Brilliant and disturbing though the expressionist and satirical pieces are , the heart of Peter Maxwell Davies 's music for me lies in those radiant works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time . You catch that quality in earlier works like the 2nd Taverner Fantasia , inspired by the music of the great Tudor composer John Tavener , and in the best of the symphonies . <p> In the later works , the harsh and beautiful landscape of Orkney shines through the austere play of lines , an influence Maxwell Davies himself pointed out . <p> This feeling for landscape shows that though Maxwell Davies may have started off as a European modernist in the making , the composer who eventually emerged was actually very English . He was English in other ways too . Like Richard Hoggart and David Hockney , he was a lower-middle-class Northern boy made good . That 's why he was so determined to pass on the values of high culture to the next generation . He knew their worth , because he 'd had to fight so hard to win them for himself . That gave him an authority which is all too rare in cultural life nowadays ; which is another reason to mourn his passing . ",

"text": "<p> Not only are the total numbers of police-involved deaths in the US appalling -- 1,134 in 2015 alone -- the final tally for the year highlighted once again the shockingly disproportionate number of African Americans affected , as was exposed by a Guardian investigation , The Counted . Young black men aged between 15 and 34 accounted for 15% of all deaths logged ( five times higher than for their white counterparts ) , despite being just 2% of the population . <p> There is another , much less well-documented feature of police brutality and violence : the prevalence of disabled people and , in particular , those with mental difficulties , who are victims . <p> Raising public awareness is vital to build pressure for change on this link between police aggression and disability <p> The report , compiled by David M Perry , a professor of history at Dominican University in Illinois , and long-time disability rights activist Lawrence Carter-Long , makes use of available data ( there are no official , comprehensive statistics collected on police-based violence and disability at local , state or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media to shine a light on the problem . <p> After examining coverage over the past three years , Perry and Carter-Long say it is shocking that the prevalence of disability is not being accurately , or commonly , reported . \" Media coverage of police violence fails to recognise or report the disability element when Americans are injured or killed by law enforcement , resulting in their stories being segregated from the issue in the media , \" they conclude . <p> Raising public awareness is vital to build pressure for change , and this is urgently needed in demonstrating the links between police aggression and disability . We know from campaigning work in the UK and the US that encountering the police or criminal justice system can be an extremely traumatic , confusing and , at worst , deadly experience for someone with a serious mental health problem or with intellectual disabilities . <p> For example , if a person 's ability to communicate is significantly impaired , be it by psychosis , autism or dementia , and responding officers are ill-equipped to identify or adequately engage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In both countries -- despite a number of positive initiatives , including the Crisis Care Concordat in Britain , attempts to improve police training as well as the introduction in some places of \" street triage \" , where health professionals accompany police on calls -- the injury and death of vulnerable citizens after being restrained has been an enduring and shameful occurrence . <p> As the Rudderman report says , it is beholden on police and policymakers in the US to fully track what is happening and develop effective , long-term responses . <p> In Britain , the National Appropriate Adult Network has repeatedly stressed that vulnerable people throughout the justice system , including the courts , need to have their welfare and rights better protected . <p> There is an indisputable onus on those with the power to protect vulnerable people from abuse and violence , wherever it is perpetrated , to take action . However , the media have to play their part too by exposing when and how the system betrays them .

A total of 12,711 non-urgent operations and 112,856 outpatient appointments have been cancelled as part of determined efforts to ensure patients ' safety when there are far fewer doctors on duty than usual . <p> New survey findings shared with the Guardian suggest that a large majority of junior doctors in England could take part in the stoppages , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council ( GMC ) , and leading medics that their action could harm patients and wreck public trust in doctors . <p> That will be a blow to Jeremy Hunt and his fellow ministers at the Department of Health , who have been hoping that trainee doctors below the level of consultant would start to desert the campaign against the new contract he plans to impose on them from August .

"title": "OnePlus 3 Launch May 2016: Multiple Display Sizes, 6GB of RAM + ...\n",
"text": "<h> OnePlus ' third handset emerges as the ... OnePlus 3 ! <p> The OnePlus 2 has been out a little while now , long enough that OnePlus has actually terminated the invite-only sales model for the device , meaning anyone can cruise over to the OnePlus webstore and buy one straight up . That can pretty much only mean one thing - a successor is already in the works for launch inside 2016 - but then , given the way we know the smartphone industry works and how in-advance development cycles are , this is hardly suprising news . <p> In the meantime , OnePlus has reduced the cost of its OnePlus 2 handset to $349 -- and it is staying that way forever . Here 's what the company had to say about the price reduction on its official blog : <p> \" We learned a lot from our first flagship phone . The invite system helped get the OnePlus 2 off the ground , and now thanks to both timing and scale , our operations have sized up to the Goldilocks principle of just right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in celebrating the fruits of our labor ? The OnePlus 2 now has a price modification of $349 , forever . If you 've ever needed to give a friend another reason to join Team OnePlus , here you go . \" <p> The company also released the OnePlus X earlier in 2015 and that handset , while nowhere near as compelling as the OnePlus 2 , is still generating quite a bit of interest from consumers . The OnePlus 2 flagship was not without its detractors , however , following the company 's decision NOT to include NFC , a fingerprint scanner or a QHD panel on the front of the device . <p> The OnePlus 3 , like every other flagship before it from the Chinese upstart , will almost certainly be released inside the company 's now infamous invite-only purchasing program , whereby users have to first get an invite before they can buy an actual phone from OnePlus . This process cuts out networks and retailers and allows the company to exercise better control of the handset 's production process , rather just building a few million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area -- well , two actually -- OnePlus could score an easy win is to do with NFC and QHD display panels . I 'm not too fussed about NFC , though I know a lot of people would like to see it included . For that reason and that reason alone , OnePlus should include it on the OnePlus 3 . Ditto Type-C USB for charging . Yes , I know it 's a bit annoying at present but it will become A LOT more common in 2016/7 , so it is best to be prepared . <p> The handset will likely feature 3GB of RAM and Qualcomm 's soon-to-be-unleashed Snapdragon 820 CPU . Beyond this we 'd expect to see some big improvements to imaging and battery performance , likely a larger cell , as well as the introduction of a QHD display panel , another key spec missing from last year 's OnePlus 2 . <h> OnePlus 3 Release Date <p> February 25 sees some more details emerge - this time we have OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei talking to CNET about the forthcoming flagship , saying that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report . Pei said that the phone will feature a \" new design \" which he hopes will \" captivate \" consumers as much as the original OnePlus One . It would appear that although the OnePlus 2 was more feature-rich and sold better than the OnePlus One , OnePlus feels that on the design front it lost some of the charm compared to the debut model . <h> First Benchmarks For OnePlus 3 Land <p> The OnePlus 3 is expected to get official in May with a release date following in the weeks after . Up to now details about 2016 's \" flagship killer \" have been pretty thin on the ground but as is often the case in the run up to a launch , leaks are starting to occur -- leaks like benchmarks which detail the specs of the handset . <p> According to recent GFX and Geekbench test results , the OnePlus 3 will have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor , 4GB or 6GB of RAM , 64GB of storage , a 16-megapixel camera , an 8-megapixel front camera and NFC support . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oxygen OS . <p> The chassis of the handset is expected to be constructed from metals and feature a fingerprint scanner as standard . Furthermore , OnePlus many retail the OnePlus 3 with different screen sizes : 5-inch , 5.2-inch and 5.5-inch options have been named in benchmarks and reports . If true , this would be the biggest and most complex launch the company has ever undertaken , proving , if successful , that it is now one of the big dogs in the phone space . <p> Why the handset will feature up to 6GB of RAM is anybody 's guess . KYM has speculated that this mount of RAM could have something to do with an Android N/Chrome OS cross-over initiative that we 'll see announced later on in 2016 . Or , it could just be because they can -- Android has always been ALL ABOUT the specs . Either way , the OnePlus 3 is shaping up to be quite a beast . Let 's just hope OnePlus manages to keep the price in line with expectations . <h> OnePlus 3 Design <p> Oneplus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of its thing ; the whole transparency and openess with its own community of fans via social media and its own forum line . That 's worked very well in the past for generating plenty of interest in its devices . Sometimes though , leaksters still beat OnePlus to the punch and reveal a new handset before the firm is necessarily ready to say \" hey , look what we 're working on \" . And on that note , images have now appeared online showing 3D renders of the next-gen device . <p> The leak comes via Mobile Dad , and the images appear to show a brushed metal back panel design which may or may not be part of a unibody . If so , this would be a departure from OnePlus ' design conventions for the flagship so far , which have previously involved interchangeable back panels in a variety of materials , including kevlar , denim , and wood . That said , using a metal panel at all is also departure as we have n't seen this until now . It 's also worth noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to showcase the firm 's premium design , placing this as a higher priority over even the specs - but even that device used glass or ceramic ( depending on which variant you opted for ) rather than a largely metal build . <p> Meanwhile , on the front there is no longer a fingerprint scanner and instead we have a front-facing speaker grille which may provide stereo sound similar to HTC 's BoomSound setup , though this is merely speculation . The source for the images also claims the handset will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip and a 1080p display - although we 've no idea of the size of the handset or the display diagonal . There 's also no word on RAM or any other specs , including the camera . <p> As of February 18 , a video has leaked showcasing the OnePlus 3 's design and a few of its features . TimesNews reports having received a tip from an unnamed source with videos and images of the new device . A photo included shows the handset in the flesh , but the video and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's claimed these are ' official ' images that have been unearthed early and are not made by third party 3D artists . <p> The design seems to have changed a bit , with a curvier shape featuring a metal frame and what looks like a brushed metal back panel , and it seems to have a fingerprint scanner . The report estimates it has a 5.5in display and there is some indication we might see a Type-C USB port . <p> \" The rumored specifications of the device includes a 5.5-inch 1080p display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection and is expected to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor . It will have two variants : 4GB RAM and 16GB inbuilt storage and 5GB RAM with 64GB inbuilt storage . It is expected to run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow based Oxygen OS out of the box . \" ",

The IPPC process has been a long one , however we are now at the final hurdle and expect a positive outcome from the Slovenian courts . In addition , we 've developed an alternative route to market which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2016 . We would like to take this opportunity to thank our partners and shareholders for your support throughout 2015 and look forward to 2016 with optimism . \" <p> Chairman 's Statement <p> Introduction <p> I am pleased to present the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2015 . <p> The issue of the permitting delays at our Peti ? ovci project was raised at the highest political level by the UK Government and we too raised it with the visiting Slovenian Prime Minister late in 2015 . <p> Towards the end of the period under review and continuing in the first few months of 2016 we have experienced a positive change in the attitude of those on whom we rely to commence production . <p> In addition , we have also seen an increase in the interest displayed by industry participants in developing our Peti ? ovci gas field once a clear route to first gas exists which is encouraging . <p> Routes to first gas <p> Shareholders may recall that we have three theoretical routes to first gas . The first and the most conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) to construct and operate a new gas treatment works . The gas would then be treated on site and piped into the national grid . The second involves sending the gas untreated across national boundaries , and the third is to supply untreated gas to a reconditioned methanol plant adjacent to our field . <p> IPPC permit <p> The preferred field development plan to date has been to install a Gas Gathering and Separation Station ( ' GGSS ' ) to reduce the carbon dioxide content of the gas to meet national grid specifications , upgrade a metering station to at the entry point to the national grid and connect the wells via the GGSS to the metering station . The installation of the GGSS requires an IPPC permit , for which an application was lodged in June 2014 ; it was initially approved and put out to public consultation in December 2014 and following an extensive consultation process the Permit was awarded in July 2015 . <p> Under the prevailing rules there is very little cost associated with objecting to the environment ministry 's decision . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however we were pleasantly surprised that only two protest groups challenged the original decision . <p> Under the appeal the Environment Minister was required to re-assess the decision of her department , which she did and in November 2015 confirmed the initial ruling to grant the Permit . <p> Under the rules , objectors again have the option to refer the Minister 's decision to the Slovenian Courts . Once again such a review is without material cost or inconvenience to the objector and inevitably one of the protesters saw fit to challenge the Minister 's decision . <p> Thankfully the referral to the Court provides the last opportunity for a decision to be reviewed . We understand that the Court has already reviewed the files and we await their decision . <p> One of the unexpected benefits of the prolonged delays has been that the costs of construction of the proposed treatment works have fallen , with some suppliers being prepared to either lease the equipment or to receive payment from gas sold . <p> In anticipation of a favourable and final ruling we have issued tenders for the metering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our gas field is within a few miles of the Austrian , Hungarian and Croatian borders . There exists a network of pipes that would allow our gas to be transported across the border to an existing and underutilised treatment facility . This route to market does not require the IPPC permit to have been issued <p> We are at an advanced stage of negotiations to have joint venture gas treated outside Slovenia . While this may not be a long term solution , in particular when the second phase of the Peti ? ovci field is developed , it would bring forward the date when we first receive income from the field . It also allows us to demonstrate to any banks that may provide project funding prolonged data on well performance and reservoir behaviour which we expect to reduce the risk and therefore the cost of any project finance facility . <p> A further advantage of this arrangement would be positive cash flow during the period when the treatment works envisaged under the IPPC permit is constructed . <p> Sale of gas to a reconditioned methanol plant <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from gas with a sulphur content higher than is acceptable for the national grid . <p> Therefore , with a disused methanol plant adjacent to our gas field we have for some time entertained thoughts of being able to achieve first gas without the need for a new treatment works and therefore without the need in the short term for an IPPC permit . <p> Our hopes were raised in September 2015 when we learnt that the methanol plant in question had been acquired by a Californian based company for ? 5 million . However , despite repeated attempts to contact the new owners , we have yet to establish whether their intention is to refurbish the plant or alternatively use it for scrap . <p> We have therefore for the time being discounted thoughts of first gas being achieved via methanol production . <p> Management <p> From September 2015 , Colin Hutchinson has in addition to being Finance Director fulfilled the duties of the CEO . I am pleased to report that following his performance the non-executive directors have resolved to appoint Colin as permanent CEO . <p> Funding <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear route to first gas . We have therefore been dependent upon issues of equity and debt to meet the costs of maintaining a presence in the UK and Slovenia . <p> In both locations we have reduced costs to a minimum , with as noted above our new CEO also fulfilling the role of Finance Director . In the UK we have held numerous discussions with industry participants interested in developing the Peti ? ovci project once a clear route to first gas exists . <p> In Slovenia our team has worked to maintain the condition of the field and prepare the tender documentation for the issue of the IPPC permit . <p> We have been reliant on the continued support of our largest stakeholders Henderson Global Investors and EnQuest PLC in the period under review and subsequently . <p> From Henderson Global Investors we drew ? 500,000 in convertible loan notes in February 2015 , a further ? 450,000 from the ? 7 million debt facility in 2015 and have drawn a further ? 350,000 of the facility since the end of the year . In July 2015 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' CLNs ' ) in full settlement of a ? 3 million liability . <p> In addition , we have taken in a further ? 1.2million in new equity over the same period thereby broadening the shareholder base and preserving the value of the Ascent investment in the Peti ? ovci project . <p> Subsequent to the period under review , on 7 April 2016 the Company raised ? 500,000 gross ( ? 477,500 net to the Company ) via the placing of 35,714,285 new ordinary shares of 0.2p each in the Company at a price of 1.4p per Placing Share with investors using the Primarybid.com platform . These funds will meet the working capital requirements of the Company until the end of Q2 2016 during which time the final outcome of the IPPC Permit and negotiations around an alternative route to first gas are expected <p> Outlook <p> We have two live options for a clear path to first gas . Our expectation is that both will crystallise during Q2 2016 . An early agreement on the cross border route would still allow first gas in 2016 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to meet its commitments during the period when these options are expected to crystallise and enables the Company to make progress towards the next stage of the project . <p> More importantly perhaps , we believe that the value of the project as a whole has been recognised by industry participants , whose interest we expect to firm up once a clear route to first gas exists . <p> The Peti ? ovci Tight Gas Project , in a 98 km2 area in north eastern Slovenia , targets the development of substantial tight gas reservoirs known to be in Miocene clastic sediments . <p> Ascent first acquired an interest in the Peti ? ovci project in 2007 and in 2009 an extensive 3D seismic survey was conducted across the Peti ? ovci concession area . <p> The structure has two sets of reservoirs , the shallower Upper Miocene and the deeper Middle Miocene . The Middle Miocene Badenian reservoirs , or Pg sands , are the focus of Ascent 's development objectives ; however , the shallow reservoirs , which were extensively developed during the 1960s , are not considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Slovenia has been an oil and gas producing area since the early 1940s and contains much of the infrastructure necessary for processing and exporting produced hydrocarbons . <p> Two new appraisal wells , Pg-10 and Pg-11 , drilled in 2010/2011 to a total vertical depth of 3,497 m and 3,500 m respectively , confirmed gas in all six Middle Miocene Badenian reservoirs ( ' A ' to ' F ' Pg sands ) . Gas flowed for the first time from the shallowest ' A ' sands and , in addition , gas and condensate were sampled from the Lower Badenian ' L ' to ' Q ' sands . Pg-10 proved productive from the ' F ' sands and Pg-11A ( Pg-11 was side-tracked for technical reasons to Pg-11A ) from the deeper ' L ' to ' Q ' sands . Both wells were successfully fracture stimulated resulting in flow rates of 8 MMscfd from the ' F ' sands and 2 MMscfd from the ' L , M and N ' sands , proving the commercial potential of both wells . <p> The data generated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-of-the-art wireline logging , supplemented the 2009 3D survey of the project area . The Company has reported independently verified P50 estimate of gas in place of 456 Bcf ( 13 Bm3 ; 76 MMboe ) . <p> Both wells will require a further recompletion prior to Phase One production which will help to better understand the long-term productivity performance of the reservoirs . The Phase One production results will inform decisions regarding the Phase Two , full field , Peti ? ovci development . <p> Back-in Rights <p> Switzerland <p> The Hermrigen and Linden exploration permits in Switzerland cover undeveloped discoveries made by Elf Aquitaine in 1972 and 1982 with a combined estimated gas resource base of over 360 Bcf . As the original Hermrigen well was drilled before gas pipeline infrastructure was built in the area , the discovery has remained unappraised . Despite selling its interest in 2010 to eCORP , the current operator of the project , Ascent retains various back-in rights on any successful outcome of six conventional appraisal prospects , provided relevant apportioned costs are covered . <p> Netherlands <p> As part of the Sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Dutch licences , Ascent has the right to re-purchase a 10% interest in each of the Dutch licences once Tulip has made a final investment decision with respect to the commercial development of the Terschelling-Noord Field . <h> Follow us on Twitter <h> Disclaimer <p> You understand and agree that no content published on the Site constitutes a recommendation that any particular security , portfolio of securities , transaction , or investment strategy is suitable or advisable for any specific person .

ovci project was raised at the highest political level by the uk government and we too raised it with the visiting slovenian prime minister late in 2015 . <p> towards the end of the period under review and continuing in the first few months of 2016 we have experienced a positive change in the attitude of those on whom we rely to commence production . <p> in addition , we have also seen an increase in the interest displayed by industry participants in developing our peti ? ovci gas field once a clear route to first gas exists which is encouraging . <p> routes to first gas <p> shareholders may recall that we have three theoretical routes to first gas . the first and the most conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) to construct and operate a new gas treatment works . the gas would then be treated on site and piped into the national grid . the second involves sending the gas untreated across national boundaries , and the third is to supply untreated gas to a reconditioned methanol plant adjacent to our field . <p> ippc permit <p> the preferred field development plan to date has been to install a gas gathering and separation station ( ' ggss ' ) to reduce the carbon dioxide content of the gas to meet national grid specifications , upgrade a metering station to at the entry point to the national grid and connect the wells via the ggss to the metering station . the installation of the ggss requires an ippc permit , for which an application was lodged in june 2014 ; it was initially approved and put out to public consultation in december 2014 and following an extensive consultation process the permit was awarded in july 2015 . <p> under the prevailing rules there is very little cost associated with objecting to the environment ministry 's decision . it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however we were pleasantly surprised that only two protest groups challenged the original decision . <p> under the appeal the environment minister was required to re-assess the decision of her department , which she did and in november 2015 confirmed the initial ruling to grant the permit . <p> under the rules , objectors again have the option to refer the minister 's decision to the slovenian courts . once again such a review is without material cost or inconvenience to the objector and inevitably one of the protesters saw fit to challenge the minister 's decision . <p> thankfully the referral to the court provides the last opportunity for a decision to be reviewed . we understand that the court has already reviewed the files and we await their decision . <p> one of the unexpected benefits of the prolonged delays has been that the costs of construction of the proposed treatment works have fallen , with some suppliers being prepared to either lease the equipment or to receive payment from gas sold . <p> in anticipation of a favourable and final ruling we have issued tenders for the metering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our gas field is within a few miles of the austrian , hungarian and croatian borders . there exists a network of pipes that would allow our gas to be transported across the border to an existing and underutilised treatment facility . this route to market does not require the ippc permit to have been issued <p> we are at an advanced stage of negotiations to have joint venture gas treated outside slovenia . while this may not be a long term solution , in particular when the second phase of the peti ? ovci field is developed , it would bring forward the date when we first receive income from the field . it also allows us to demonstrate to any banks that may provide project funding prolonged data on well performance and reservoir behaviour which we expect to reduce the risk and therefore the cost of any project finance facility . <p> a further advantage of this arrangement would be positive cash flow during the period when the treatment works envisaged under the ippc permit is constructed . <p> sale of gas to a reconditioned methanol plant <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from gas with a sulphur content higher than is acceptable for the national grid . <p> therefore , with a disused methanol plant adjacent to our gas field we have for some time entertained thoughts of being able to achieve first gas without the need for a new treatment works and therefore without the need in the short term for an ippc permit . <p> our hopes were raised in september 2015 when we learnt that the methanol plant in question had been acquired by a californian based company for ? 5 million . however , despite repeated attempts to contact the new owners , we have yet to establish whether their intention is to refurbish the plant or alternatively use it for scrap . <p> we have therefore for the time being discounted thoughts of first gas being achieved via methanol production . <p> management <p> from september 2015 , colin hutchinson has in addition to being finance director fulfilled the duties of the ceo . i am pleased to report that following his performance the non-executive directors have resolved to appoint colin as permanent ceo . <p> funding <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear route to first gas . we have therefore been dependent upon issues of equity and debt to meet the costs of maintaining a presence in the uk and slovenia . <p> in both locations we have reduced costs to a minimum , with as noted above our new ceo also fulfilling the role of finance director . in the uk we have held numerous discussions with industry participants interested in developing the peti ? ovci project once a clear route to first gas exists . <p> in slovenia our team has worked to maintain the condition of the field and prepare the tender documentation for the issue of the ippc permit . <p> we have been reliant on the continued support of our largest stakeholders henderson global investors and enquest plc in the period under review and subsequently . <p> from henderson global investors we drew ? 500,000 in convertible loan notes in february 2015 , a further ? 450,000 from the ? 7 million debt facility in 2015 and have drawn a further ? 350,000 of the facility since the end of the year . in july 2015 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' clns ' ) in full settlement of a ? 3 million liability . <p> in addition , we have taken in a further ? 1.2million in new equity over the same period thereby broadening the shareholder base and preserving the value of the ascent investment in the peti ? ovci project . <p> subsequent to the period under review , on 7 april 2016 the company raised ? 500,000 gross ( ? 477,500 net to the company ) via the placing of 35,714,285 new ordinary shares of 0.2p each in the company at a price of 1.4p per placing share with investors using the primarybid.com platform . these funds will meet the working capital requirements of the company until the end of q2 2016 during which time the final outcome of the ippc permit and negotiations around an alternative route to first gas are expected <p> outlook <p> we have two live options for a clear path to first gas . our expectation is that both will crystallise during q2 2016 . an early agreement on the cross border route would still allow first gas in 2016 . <p> the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to meet its commitments during the period when these options are expected to crystallise and enables the company to make progress towards the next stage of the project . <p> more importantly perhaps , we believe that the value of the project as a whole has been recognised by industry participants , whose interest we expect to firm up once a clear route to first gas exists . <p> the peti ? ovci tight gas project , in a 98 km2 area in north eastern slovenia , targets the development of substantial tight gas reservoirs known to be in miocene clastic sediments . <p> ascent first acquired an interest in the peti ? ovci project in 2007 and in 2009 an extensive 3d seismic survey was conducted across the peti ? ovci concession area . <p> the structure has two sets of reservoirs , the shallower upper miocene and the deeper middle miocene . the middle miocene badenian reservoirs , or pg sands , are the focus of ascent 's development objectives ; however , the shallow reservoirs , which were extensively developed during the 1960s , are not considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slovenia has been an oil and gas producing area since the early 1940s and contains much of the infrastructure necessary for processing and exporting produced hydrocarbons . <p> two new appraisal wells , pg-10 and pg-11 , drilled in 2010/2011 to a total vertical depth of 3,497 m and 3,500 m respectively , confirmed gas in all six middle miocene badenian reservoirs ( ' a ' to ' f ' pg sands ) . gas flowed for the first time from the shallowest ' a ' sands and , in addition , gas and condensate were sampled from the lower badenian ' l ' to ' q ' sands . pg-10 proved productive from the ' f ' sands and pg-11a ( pg-11 was side-tracked for technical reasons to pg-11a ) from the deeper ' l ' to ' q ' sands . both wells were successfully fracture stimulated resulting in flow rates of 8 mmscfd from the ' f ' sands and 2 mmscfd from the ' l , m and n ' sands , proving the commercial potential of both wells . <p> the data generated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-of-the-art wireline logging , supplemented the 2009 3d survey of the project area . the company has reported independently verified p50 estimate of gas in place of 456 bcf ( 13 bm3 ; 76 mmboe ) . <p> both wells will require a further recompletion prior to phase one production which will help to better understand the long-term productivity performance of the reservoirs . the phase one production results will inform decisions regarding the phase two , full field , peti ? ovci development . <p> back-in rights <p> switzerland <p> the hermrigen and linden exploration permits in switzerland cover undeveloped discoveries made by elf aquitaine in 1972 and 1982 with a combined estimated gas resource base of over 360 bcf . as the original hermrigen well was drilled before gas pipeline infrastructure was built in the area , the discovery has remained unappraised . despite selling its interest in 2010 to ecorp , the current operator of the project , ascent retains various back-in rights on any successful outcome of six conventional appraisal prospects , provided relevant apportioned costs are covered . <p> netherlands <p> as part of the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former dutch licences , ascent has the right to re-purchase a 10% interest in each of the dutch licences once tulip has made a final investment decision with respect to the commercial development of the terschelling-noord field . <h> follow us on twitter <h> disclaimer <p> you understand and agree that no content published on the site constitutes a recommendation that any particular security , portfolio of securities , transaction , or investment strategy is suitable or advisable for any specific person . you further understand that none of the information providers or their affiliates will advise you personally concerning the nature , potential , advisability , value or suitability of any particular stock , share , security , portfolio of securities , transaction , investment strategy , or other matter . we openly disclose that we and our contributors may have interests in investments and/or providers of services referred to within the website and that we receive remuneration from certain of the companies referred to on this website.

"text": "<h> Yesterday was one of the worst days of my life <h> Share This <p> When I got an email from the Evening Standard 's education correspondent at 06.29am yesterday I had no idea that my life was about to turn to shit . She had just read an interview I 'd done for a magazine called Schools Week in which , among other things , I said that I was standing down as chief executive of the group of free schools I 've helped set up . She wanted to talk to me about why I 'd made this decision . <p> At that point , I made a terrible mistake . I asked if I could send her an email explaining why I was stepping down rather than talk to her in person . The reason for this is that I 'm in the midst of a terrible bout of summer flu . So I dashed off a quick email <p> It became clear just how stupid that was when I noticed that I 'd started trending on Twitter at around noon . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journalist who 'd contacted me , headlined : ' Toby Young : Running free school was harder than I thought . ' The opening paragraph read : \" Toby Young today admitted running a free school is more difficult than he thought as he prepares to step down as CEO of the West London Free School Trust . \" <p> I gawped at this with horror . At no point had I said , either in my email or in the Schools Week interview , that \" running a free school \" was \" harder than I thought \" . Critics of free schools often claim that amateurs like me are n't qualified to \" run \" schools and my response has always been that the people who set up free schools are n't the people who run them , unless they happen to be experienced teachers . Free schools , like nearly every other type of school , are run by headteachers . But the Standard headline made it sound as if I was agreeing with the policy 's critics . <p> In the Schools Week interview , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about teachers in the past and I also said that one of the lessons I 'd learnt is that high expectations and a traditional , knowledge-based curriculum are n't , by themselves , enough to make a good school . Just as important is making sure you have the right leaders in place who share your vision . <p> However , I did n't in any way link these observations to my decision to stand down as chief executive . I was merely reflecting on some of the lessons I 'd learnt along the way . The Standard piece gave the impression that I now regretted having bitten off more than I could chew and , having fallen flat on my face , I now wanted to hand over to a professional . <p> It got worse . The Mirror published it 's own version of the story , headlined : ' Toby Young admits \" running a school was harder than I thought \" in extraordinary Free Schools climbdown . ' This was followed by the Independent -- ' Toby Young admits \" running a school was harder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO ' -- and the Times : ' Poster boy of free schools quits ' . <p> I began to tear my hair out -- or would have done if I had any . The Standard 's misleading headline had now become a direct quote and all the follow-up stories made it sound as if I was confessing to gross incompetence . <p> In fact , the schools in our multi-academy trust are all a huge success , something I 'm immensely proud of . Yes , making the schools work has been a challenge , but all the people involved in the trust , including the original group of \" amateur \" parent-founders , have overcome those challenges . <p> The secondary school , which opened in 2011 , was ranked ' Good ' by Ofsted in 2013 , and the West London Free School Primary , which opened in 2013 , was ranked ' Outstanding ' last year . We now have excellent senior leaders across all the schools , as well as fantastic classroom teachers , and I 'm sure our first batch of results , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And by \" above average \" I mean among the best in the country . <p> The reason I 'm stepping down as CEO -- I 'm not quitting , for heaven 's sake -- is because our trust is expanding , not contracting . Our hope is to become a multi-academy trust containing 10-20 schools over the next 10 years and that requires a more seasoned chief executive than me who can commit to the job full-time . ( I do it three days a week . ) And I 'll stay on as a director and remain involved in the schools for years to come , not least because my daughter is at one of them and my other three children will soon follow . <p> The news stories were terrible , but the comments on Twitter were something else . At one point , so many left-wing critics of free schools were crowing with satisfaction that I became one of the five most tweeted about subject in the UK . Not bad on the day that results started pouring in from elections all over the country . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to the day he falls into a pit of hungry bears wearing honey-and-fish cologne , \" said a children 's author , while someone describing himself as an \" artist/musician \" said \" I would enjoy punching his face to a pulp with no remorse \" . <p> Others took what they saw as my admission of failure as proof that entrusting rank amateurs with running schools ruined children 's lives : \" Too late for the thousands of children 's education he has screwed up , unforgivable . \" <p> Some conspiracy theorists , believing the headline quote to be accurate , accused me of choosing yesterday as a good day to bury bad news , along with Nicky Morgan , who announced her U-turn on academies in the midst of the local election results . If that was my plan , it had clearly backfired . <p> But the tweets that were hardest to take were those praising me for my honesty . \" Still though , nice of him to admit openly that the Tories education policy is a total car-crash , \" tweeted a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to his profile . Another said : \" Much as I hate Toby Young , at least he had the decency to admit he was wrong . \" <p> On and on it went , like some unfolding nightmare . I then got a call from Channel 4 News asking if I 'd like to come on to talk about why I 'd had a change of heart about free schools . ( More gnashing of teeth . ) In spite of my hacking cough , I thought it might give me an opportunity to correct some of the misunderstandings that had sprung up throughout the day so I made my way to the studio . <p> I was on with a special needs teacher who is an ardent critic of free schools and academies and we were due to talk about Morgan 's U-turn as well as my news . I thought it started out reasonably well , in which I explained that I was n't stepping down because I 'd decided the free schools policy was unworkable , but because the ones I 'd helped set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make much of an impression on John Snow , the programme 's veteran presenter , because he then asked me if I thought the reason Morgan had rowed back on turning all schools into academies was because of the failure of my schools . <p> I was stunned . So nothing to do with the rebellion against universal academisation gathering force on the Tory backbenches , but just down to me and my supposed abandonment of the free schools policy ? This was n't exactly what I 'd had in mind by putting the record straight . <p> All in all , a truly terrible day . I do n't think the Evening Standard journalist intended to put a malevolent spin on the story -- and I 'm sure she did n't write the headline -- but the combination of the two created a frame for the news of my departure as CEO that was a gift to critics of the government 's education reforms . <p> For the past seven years , I 've been a passionate advocate of free schools and have painstakingly avoided saying or doing anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics . Yet at a stroke , I 'd somehow undone all that work . I do n't doubt that for years to come , opponents of the policy will cite my \" mea culpa \" as exhibit A in the case for the prosecution . <p> What pains me the most is the thought of how all my fellow free school founders will react to these misleading reports . It 's still a relatively small world and I know many of them personally . Again and again , I 've told them to keep the faith , to treat obstacles as reasons to try harder rather than give up , to stay true to their dreams . How will they respond when they read an article in The Times saying I 've \" quit \" because I 've changed my mind about the free schools programme ? It makes me want to weep . <p> Well , for the record , I have n't quit . I 'm going to stay on as a director of the trust and will remain involved for many years to come . The schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I visit them , as I do almost every day , it warms my heart to see how effectively the children , staff and governors have brought the founders ' original vision to life . Here are hundreds and hundreds of children from all backgrounds receiving the kind of education that 's usually reserved for the offspring of the privileged elite . Helping to set these schools up has been the most rewarding experience of my professional life and I 'd recommend it to anyone . Apart from the horrible , spite-filled critics , ready to pounce at the slightest opportunity . That bit is n't so nice , obviously . <p> If you 'd like to set up a free school , please contact the New Schools Network . Or if you 'd like to apply for the job of CEO of the West London Free School Academy Trust click here . ",

"text": "<p> IT took Richard Linklater 12 years to make the Oscar-nominated movie Boyhood . <p> So you can hardly blame him for playing fast and loose with his next film . Over the course of three days in the autumn of 1980 , a hard-drinking , bong-smoking , skirt-chasing university baseball team awaits the first day of term . <p> This lot are far too busy having the time of their lives to stop and think about what it all means . This funny , brilliantly acted and wonderfully written romp lives up to its billing as \" the spiritual sequel \" to Linklater 's 1970s-set high school movie Dazed and Confused . <p> It is another star-free , period drama that perfectly recreates the spirit of a year and the age of its characters . <p> The soundtrack and the production design are spot-on .

"text": "<h> 5 Reasons ZZ Top 's Glastonbury Set Was Rock'n'Roll Gold <p> When it comes to rock legends , there are no bigger - or beardier - than ZZ Top . Forming a whopping 47 years ago , the Texan trio are so relaxed about playing to tens of thousands of people on the Pyramid Stage that they 're practically horizontal . Here are the five reasons why their Friday afternoon set proved their status as guitar heroes . <p> The Jewellery ZZ Top love a bit of bling . Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill and weighed down with so much jewellery it 's a wonder that they can actually play their guitars . They 've hefty skull rings on their fingers , chunky silver bangles and necklaces upon necklaces dangling around their throats . And they look good . Sharp in fact . Making their thundering trip through 1983 's ' Sharp Dressed Man ' all the more spot-on . <p> The Tunes ZZ Top are not one of those bands you go to watch to let their brand new experimental direction wash over you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hits they provide . We get ' Gim me All Your Lovin ' , ' La Grange ' , the aforementioned ' Sharp Dressed Man ' , ' Legs ' , ' Tush ' and a whole bunch of other songs containing thinly veiled references to women 's bottoms , as well as 1994 's ' Pincushion ' , which features the immortal lyric \" I 'm getting pricked around and punctureated/I let my ya ya down , I got penetrated \" . Excellent stuff . They also cover Jimi Hendrix 's ' Foxy Lady ' if you 're into that kind of thing , and the air-guitaring masses gathered here today very much are . <p> The Synchronised Guitar Playing Billy Gibbons - he 's the one with the lighter shade of beard - and Dusty Hill 's synchronised guitar playing is a thing of beauty . They 've spent almost half a century perfecting their slick onstage trick and it 's a simple but oh so effective way of making them look ultra cool . <p> Billy Gibbons ' Indistinguishable Banter Born in Houston , Texas , Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it in every gruff gurgle of his voice . Half of the time his accent is so thick that it 's nigh on impossible to work out what he 's saying . \" Time to drink a little whisskaayyyyy , \" he roars before ' Chartreuse ' . Rest assured the rest of the time he 's probably talking about butts . Or booze . Or both . The moment he lights up not a cigarette , but an actual cigar during the finale of ' Tush ' , also warrants a mention . <p> The Bearded Keyboard ZZ Top have beards . We all know this . Well , all aside from their drummer , who in one of the great ironies of rock is called Frank Beard . ZZ Top 's keyboard also has a beard . Wheeled out for a rollicking version of ' La Grange ' , Dusty 's keys are draped in the kind of fluff that high street stores sometimes like to pop in the window when it 's Christmas and pretend it 's snow . In ZZ Top 's case , the fluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ",

"text": "<h> JK Rowling just released an epic tale about the history of Ilvermorny and American magic <p> With Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them due in cinemas later this year , JK Rowling has just treated us to a data dump of detail about the history of American magic -- or , more specifically , the foundations of Ilvermorny . You know , the American equivalent to Hogwarts where US witches and wizards learn their craft . <p> The information comes in the form of a brand new story released on Pottermore -- but for those of you at work ( or without a spare 15 minutes to plough through all the new facts ) , we 've taken it upon ourselves to break down some essential details for you . <p> Here goes ... <p> 1 . Ilvermorny was founded in the 17th century by Isolt Sayre , a young woman from Ireland whose parents were murdered ( so far , so Harry Potter ) by her mother 's estranged sister Gormlaith Gaunt ( yes , Gaunt . Y'know the ancestors of Tom Riddle AKA Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salazar Slytherin and , suffice to say , a whole lot worse than Petunia Dursley . <p> 2 . After being kidnapped by Gormaith and kept isolated for years , Isolt eventually escaped , stealing her aunt 's wand and making for America aboard a ship . Once there she acquired some companions -- two young boy wizards , a No-Maj ( that 's American for Muggle ) man called James and a creature known as a Pukwudgie , described by Rowling as \" a short , grey-faced , large-eared creature distantly related to the European goblin . \" He does n't stick around two long but plays a crucial role in the protection of Ilvermorny later on . <p> 3 . Yes , Ilvermorny -- the American version of Hogwarts . Together the foursome founded it , first as a stone cottage which grew over the years to become a magnificent castle . Isolt married James and together they raised and taught the boys -- Webster and Chadwick -- witchcraft and wizardry . They also had two little girls , Martha and Rionach , but the family 's happiness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gormlaith just happened to be a skilled tracker and , with Ilvermorny still in its fledgling stages , she caught wind of her niece 's new venture and set out to destroy it . The odds were stacked in her favour -- she had powerful magic , the element of surprise , and the fact that Isolt 's stolen wand responded to her command . But ... <p> 5 . She did n't bargain on the young wizards -- Webster and Chadwick -- hellbent on protecting their home . It 's no spoiler than Ilvermorny lived on to welcome generations of witches and wizards through its doors , although we 're not going to spoil exactly how it survived -- JK Rowling can tell that story far better than us . <p> 6 . A few centuries have since passed but Isolt , James , Chadwick and Webster 's presence lives on at Ilvermorny . Each named one of the school 's four houses : the Horned Serpent ( chosen by Isolt ) , the panther Wampus ( Webster ) , the Thunderbird ( Chadwick ) and the Pukwudgie ( James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school 's entrance hall and , come the sorting ceremony , each pupil stands between the four enchanted beasts waiting for them to indicate their desire to have them in their house . ( Fancy being sorted ? Ilvermorny now has its own sorting quiz ! ) <p> 7 . The school 's robes are blue and cranberry , honouring the Ilvermorny 's first joint headmistress and headmaster , Isolt and James -- \" blue because it was Isolt 's favourite colour and because she had wished to be in Ravenclaw house as a child ; cranberry in honour of James 's love of cranberry pie . \" <p> 8 . William the Pukwudgie became the school 's private security/maintenance service and to this day Ilvermorny still counts a number of Pukwudgies among its staff , including one elderly creature named William .

As part of this application process FinnAust is required to submit a SIA and an Environmental Impact Assessment ( ' EIA ' ) , describing the potential impacts and planned mitigation measures for the Project 's construction , operation and closure . Having received approval for its EIA work programme in August 2016 the Company is delighted to receive the approval of its SIA work programme , marking another major milestone achievement in the Project 's permitting . As part of the application for an exploitation licence , FinnAust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study is well advanced with further details to be provided on this aspect in due course . <p> The SIA at Pituffik will aim to identify any potential social impacts the Project may have and ultimately seek to optimise positive impacts , such a job creation and investment into infrastructure , whilst mitigating negative impacts . With this in mind , the Company will inform and involve relevant and affected individuals and stake-holders , including residents living in towns , settlements and communities that may be directly or indirectly impacted , early in the development process and will develop a defined Benefit and Impact Plan which will be regularly reviewed and updated throughout the Project 's lifetime . The programme will be conducted in consultation with the Greenland Mineral Resources Authority ( ' MRA ' ) and will be managed by NIRAS Greenland A/S , an international , multidisciplinary consultancy company that was appointed by FinnAust earlier in the year for this purpose . <p> FinnAust Mining plc CEO Roderick McIllree said , \" With on-the-ground exploration continuing to deliver encouraging results , further underpinning the Project 's commercial value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives of delivering a maiden resource late this year and commencing a bulk sampling programme in 2017 . To facilitate this we are delighted with the consistent progress we are making from a licencing perspective . With our EIA work programme well underway , the approval of our SIA work programme is a significant achievement not only in terms of the Project 's development and our application process for an exploitation licence , but also for the region as a whole . The Qaanaaq district , where Pituffik is located , has one of the highest unemployment rates in Greenland , and as a result we are committed to ensuring our presence in the region positively benefits both the local and wider community .

' So let 's put Hinkley Point C on the bill so we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerns : Paul Massara said the last thing he wants to see is costlier bills . Inset : how the plant will look <p> A Competition &amp; Markets Authority report this year into the energy sector said there was a ' lack of effective communication ' over the impact of Government policies and regulatory policies on domestic bills and said this must change as it had led to a ' lack of trust ' in the sector . <p> Paul Massara , the boss of renewable energy firm North Star Solar and the former chief executive of RWE Npower , said : ' Hinkley will add ? 12 to ? 45 to consumers ' annual bills , depending on who you believe . The energy industry is concerned because bills can go up when the Government slaps taxes on , even when the wholesale price of energy goes down and we get the blame . ' <p> The Government has agreed a controversial minimum price guarantee or strike price of ? 92.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years , rising with inflation , for power generated by the plant , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ? 39 per Mwh . <p> Consumers will pay the difference between the wholesale price of power and the strike price if the wholesale price is lower . The National Audit Office has said the cost to consumers would be ? 30 billion -- an extra ? 30 on the average annual bill over the next 35 years , or more than ? 1,000 per household . <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h> Share this article <p> Share <p> The estimated cost to consumers has risen considerably since October 2013 , when the Coalition Government agreed the strike price . The increase to consumers ' bills was expected to be just over ? 6 billion . The higher difference is primarily because the collapse in the price of oil and gas has seen the cost of wholesale energy plummet . <p> ' Remember when David Cameron said \" Get rid of the green c**p \" , when he wanted to cut energy bills after they became a serious political issue ? So the last thing we want to see is more costs put on bills , ' said Massara . <p> Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a range of taxes rolled up in energy bills . Environmental and social costs -- which include the cost of home insulation and help with energy bills for vulnerable households -- make up nearly 13 per cent of the average bill , while VAT adds another 4.76 per cent . The wholesale cost of electricity accounts for just 40 per cent of the average annual bill of about ? 1,200 for a family , with other costs including distribution making up the remainder . <p> Energy firms can already itemise their bills , though few do , but spelling out the cost of Hinkley Point has not been suggested before . Energy regulator Ofgem said it would not force power companies to itemise bills . ' We insist suppliers tell customers what their cheapest tariff is on bills , but bills are already complicated enough , ' it said . The Government said it had acted to keep the cost of subsidies down , ending subsidies for onshore wind power for instance . <p> Suppliers also fear domestic customers will shoulder the full burden of the strike price alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy Nicholson , director of the Energy Intensive Users Group , which represents firms including chemicals , ceramics and steel plants , said some industries are entitled to subsidies under European Union rules and these could continue after Britain exits the EU . <p> ' The Government is therefore planning to exempt certain industries from most of the impact of the Hinkley strike price on their electricity bills , ' he said . ' We do n't know yet whether the UK will remain constrained by EU state aid rules after Brexit -- it is possible that the Government may be free to offer 100 per cent compensation , should it be willing to do so , though this is likely to remain unclear for months and possibly years to come . ' <p> EDF 's Hinkley Point C will be the most expensive building ever made and the rest of the energy industry is determined that it will not be blamed when consumers start paying for it . <p> The Government approved the project after a delay , prompted by security concerns over the Chinese involvement . Announcing last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put new safeguards in place to give it greater control over future critical infrastructure projects with foreign investors . <p> Ironically last week , former French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron , who until August was a member of the government that championed Hinkley , warned that Britain would find itself at the mercy of Chinese economic interests if it left the EU .

' so let 's put hinkley point c on the bill so we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns : paul massara said the last thing he wants to see is costlier bills . inset : how the plant will look <p> a competition &amp; markets authority report this year into the energy sector said there was a ' lack of effective communication ' over the impact of government policies and regulatory policies on domestic bills and said this must change as it had led to a ' lack of trust ' in the sector . <p> paul massara , the boss of renewable energy firm north star solar and the former chief executive of rwe npower , said : ' hinkley will add ? 12 to ? 45 to consumers ' annual bills , depending on who you believe . the energy industry is concerned because bills can go up when the government slaps taxes on , even when the wholesale price of energy goes down and we get the blame . ' <p> the government has agreed a controversial minimum price guarantee or strike price of ? 92.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years , rising with inflation , for power generated by the plant , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ? 39 per mwh . <p> consumers will pay the difference between the wholesale price of power and the strike price if the wholesale price is lower . the national audit office has said the cost to consumers would be ? 30 billion -- an extra ? 30 on the average annual bill over the next 35 years , or more than ? 1,000 per household . <h> related articles <h> share this article <p> share <p> the estimated cost to consumers has risen considerably since october 2013 , when the coalition government agreed the strike price . the increase to consumers ' bills was expected to be just over ? 6 billion . the higher difference is primarily because the collapse in the price of oil and gas has seen the cost of wholesale energy plummet . <p> ' remember when david cameron said \" get rid of the green c**p \" , when he wanted to cut energy bills after they became a serious political issue ? so the last thing we want to see is more costs put on bills , ' said massara . <p> energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a range of taxes rolled up in energy bills . environmental and social costs -- which include the cost of home insulation and help with energy bills for vulnerable households -- make up nearly 13 per cent of the average bill , while vat adds another 4.76 per cent . the wholesale cost of electricity accounts for just 40 per cent of the average annual bill of about ? 1,200 for a family , with other costs including distribution making up the remainder . <p> energy firms can already itemise their bills , though few do , but spelling out the cost of hinkley point has not been suggested before . energy regulator ofgem said it would not force power companies to itemise bills . ' we insist suppliers tell customers what their cheapest tariff is on bills , but bills are already complicated enough , ' it said . the government said it had acted to keep the cost of subsidies down , ending subsidies for onshore wind power for instance . <p> suppliers also fear domestic customers will shoulder the full burden of the strike price alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeremy nicholson , director of the energy intensive users group , which represents firms including chemicals , ceramics and steel plants , said some industries are entitled to subsidies under european union rules and these could continue after britain exits the eu . <p> ' the government is therefore planning to exempt certain industries from most of the impact of the hinkley strike price on their electricity bills , ' he said . ' we do n't know yet whether the uk will remain constrained by eu state aid rules after brexit -- it is possible that the government may be free to offer 100 per cent compensation , should it be willing to do so , though this is likely to remain unclear for months and possibly years to come . ' <p> edf 's hinkley point c will be the most expensive building ever made and the rest of the energy industry is determined that it will not be blamed when consumers start paying for it . <p> the government approved the project after a delay , prompted by security concerns over the chinese involvement . announcing last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put new safeguards in place to give it greater control over future critical infrastructure projects with foreign investors . <p> ironically last week , former french economy and industry minister emmanuel macron , who until august was a member of the government that championed hinkley , warned that britain would find itself at the mercy of chinese economic interests if it left the eu .

"text": "<p> The billionaire hoping to become Britain 's biggest fracker has said banning shale gas would cement the decline of UK manufacturing , as he brushed off environmental concerns about the hotly disputed energy source . <p> Asked about the impact fracking could have , Ratcliffe said : \" I 'm from the north and there are parts of the north that are not happy places . \" He added that some towns that once thrived on industries such as coal or steel were now \" a bit grim \" . <h> Labour government would ban fracking in UK <p> Read more <p> \" The future for manufacturing in the UK will look quite gloomy if we do n't exploit shale , \" he said . \" I ca n't see otherwise what is going to arrest the decline in British manufacturing . \" <p> As well as importing ethane from the US for use in the chemicals industry , Ineos has licences to frack in the UK covering 1m acres , double the size of the Yorkshire Dales national park . <p> Ratcliffe said the shale gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and created jobs but stoked fierce environmental protests -- could be replicated in Britain . <p> \" There 's no reason shale ca n't do the same things to the UK manufacturing industry as it has done in America . It dragged them out of recession in 2008 on the back of the shale revolution . The UK is clearly sat on a lot of potential shale in the same way the US is . \" <p> The JS Ineos Insight ship carrying the first shipment of shale gas from the United States as it passes the Forth bridge to dock at Grangemouth . Photograph : Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images <p> He also brushed off environmental fears about fracking , a controversial technique that critics say needlessly prolongs fossil fuel use , risks polluting the water table and has been linked to earthquakes . <p> One of Ineos 's gas suppliers , Range Resources , was slapped with a $4m fine in the US for environmental breaches earlier this week . <p> Ratcliffe said : \" Occasionally things happen despite our best efforts . We do have spills , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we spend time trying to minimise that . <p> \" Life is a balance . You like your hot shower , you like your iPhone and you like to drive your motor car . That 's the balance . \" <p> In an earlier interview with BBC Radio Scotland , Ratcliffe likened environmental accidents to getting a puncture in a tyre . Friends of the Earth responded angrily , saying the comparison was \" cavalier \" . <p> \" You can fix a puncture in a matter of minutes , \" said Friends of the Earth Scotland 's head of campaigns Mary Church . \" It may never be possible to fix groundwater contamination from leaking fracking wells . \" <p> Ratcliffe 's comments on shale came as Ineos 's Grangemouth plant prepared to take delivery of 27,500 cubic metres of ethane delivered by tanker from the US , the culmination of an investment that Ineos says has reached $2bn . <h> Labour 's pledge to ban fracking in the UK is ' madness ' , says GMB <p> Read more <p> The firm fought a bitter battle with trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close unless it was converted into a shale gas import terminal . <p> Ratcliffe said Grangemouth , near Edinburgh , had been \" on its knees \" before Ineos decided to spend ? 450m on converting the plant to accept shale gas imports . <p> Ethane shipped from the US will replace waning North Sea supplies , allowing the plant to run profitably , a plan the company says will secure 10,000 jobs for at least 20 years . The company said the arrival of imports would render the plant profitable \" overnight \" , a few years after it was losing around ? 100m a year . <p> But the gas to be processed at Grangemouth is also part of a lengthy and extremely carbon-intensive journey . <p> Ethane is separated from gas fracked from the Marcellus shale formation in western Pennsylvania before being sent via a pipeline to the Marcellus Hook export terminal on the US east coast . <p> The tanker is the first of eight shipping ethane from US shale fields .

I saw her and ran to get the phone and called an ambulance . I did n't know what else to do . \" <p> After Haywood was convicted by a majority verdict , Judge Jonathan Bennett handed him an eight-month prison sentence suspended for two years , and banned him from driving for two years . <p> He also ordered Haywood to pay ? 1,500 costs and to perform 150 hours of unpaid work . <p> The judge said : \" You are going to live with this for years to come and others will live with it for even longer than that . <p> \" You did not , that day , I accept , expect this to happen , you set off to do a day 's work , you were doing what you enjoyed doing , but you were careless that day . \" <p> Following the trial , Miss Wright 's mother , Sharon Brown , said : \" I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see the driver sent to prison . When something as tragic as this happens , there are no winners . \" <p> Earlier , in a victim impact statement read out to the court , she described how her daughter had told her she was planning a family , and told the court she is \" heartbroken \" that will never happen . <p> Miss Wright 's partner James Faulkner told the court that the couple had been together since they were both aged 14 . <p> \" I have lost everything , my life has been completely reset and I have no idea how to start again without Louise , \" he said . <p> \" She was unique , she was so very special . She was always there to support me physically and emotionally and now I go home to an empty house every night . <p> Born in Scotland , Simon moved to London aged seven and now lives in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds with his miniature schnauzer , Elodie .

Did he go out that morning intending to kill someone ? Of course not , he 's not a psychopath , he 's just an idiot who made a mistake . Putting him in prison just means that we all pay for his stupidity through our taxes . So let him walk \" free \" , but the penalty should hurt .

Probably not . Except that we 'd have to feed him , I 'd hope he never works again.Certainly not driving anything . <p> Agree prison should be for where there was intent . An accident through negligence should cost time and money to the defendant . Outside of prison they can earn to pay that . <p> If they cause death by accident they should be banned from driving for life . Taxi 's and busses will benefit , and no other road user will ever suffer from their ignorance . They should also be taxed to support victim support , for the rest of their working life . <p> You should n't have an HGV license after the ban . Start back at the beginning with a provisional . Practice . Do another car test . When you have demonstrated you can do that to a competent standard start thinking about other tests . <p> To be fair , from the report , he sounds much more remorsefull than we usually hear . Stayed at the sceen , called ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the best way to deal with this situation . <p> To be fair , from the report , he sounds much more remorsefull than we usually hear .

Start back at the beginning with a provisional . Practice . Do another car test . When you have demonstrated you can do that to a competent standard start thinking about other tests . <p> I think bans are more appropriate , particularly if it involves a large vehicle , taxi or bus . Allow them to retest for normal cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaking HGV license , or taxi license etc . Also , any collision involving serious injury or death should be reported to insurance for 10 years instead of 5 . <p> you can class it as victim blaming but I seriously think as a cyclist you should anticipate and expect the worst , particularly when a vehicle emerges from a junction or ther is a left turn opportunity . <p> Take the moral high ground if you want but your family wont thank you when they 're stood over your grave . <p> If you treat every motorist as a fcking retard and assume at all times they have n't seen you , you will be far safer . The amount of times I have avoided collisions ( funnily enough I avoided one today ) by assuming every car driver has nt seen me and is going to do the unthinkable is untrue . <p> Sound advice , that I wholly agree with . Although this is one of those classic left hooks with the added danger of no mirror checks or indication . It 's a bit like the DfT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet fa to do with the way you are riding , and everything to do with how the deathtrap about to randomly turn into you is operated . <p> So you are right , victim blaming indeed . <p> The real issue is the judicial \" you did n't mean to \" punishment . His driving fell far below any standards , and he should be without a license for alot longer , with checks on his driving carried out at all levels after his ban . It 's actually logical because he wo n't have been driving for quite a while during his ban , his standards may have slipped further . ",

"text": "<h> Graziano Pelle thrown out of Italy squad for refusing to shake manager 's hand <p> By Eurosport <p> 16 hours ago <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> 0 <h> Italy boss Giampiero Ventura has excluded Graziano Pelle from Italy 's next match with Macedonia after the striker refused his handshake when substituted . <p> The Shandong Luneng forward issued an apology on instagram , but it appears that this was too little , too late for his veteran coach . <p> After starting the World Cup qualifying match with Spain , Pelle was substituted on 59 minutes , but will now miss the next game with Macedonia on Sunday . <p> Pelle 's apology read as follows : <p> \" Oh yes ! Unfortunately , I 've done a stupid thing again ? ? . It was unacceptable bit of behaviour , against the coach in the first place and also to my team-mates , who have always shown themselves to have important values ? ? within a great ITALY group in which we belong . \" <p> \" As with all serious errors , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take responsibility for the incident . It 's only right to submit my heartfelt apologies to everyone . \" <p> Ventura had initially appeared to play down the incident even before the former Southampton player had apologised . <p> \" Pelle was angry , I think this was not so much because of the substitution as the way we had played up to that point , \" he said after the game . <p> \" It 's part of football , it 's something I 've seen many times in my career . But when you wear the Italy shirt , you need to be careful . \" <p> But he clearly did n't able to leave it at that , and the decision was made to axe the 31-year-old player from the squad . <p> The FIGC released a statement to the press , in which they confirmed the decision , and added that Pelle would return to his parent club in China : <p> \" The coach Gian Piero Ventura , in agreement with the FIGC , has decided to exclude the player Graziano Pell ? from the squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 in Skopje , for disrespectful behavior at the time of his substitution during the match yesterday with Spain . <p> \" To be part of the Italy squad involves the sharing of values that are befitting of the national team , starting with showing respect towards the staff , teammates and fans . The player will return today to his parent club . \" <h> OUR VIEW <p> On first hearing this story , we thought it seemed unnecessarily harsh . It seems quite a punishment for what could have been an accidental or inadvertent . <p> But then we saw the video . This was pretty outrageous behaviour - and Pelle 's statement admitted as much . <p> After all , how hard is it to do a handshake ? Unless you play for Manchester United , that is. ",

"text": "<p> Tim Farron has described the hard brexit the Government seems set to hurtle towards as an \" act of economic vandalism . \" <p> He has responded to reports over the last two days that leaving the single market and customs union would cost a massive ? 66 billion a year . From the Independent : <p> The leaked government document says : \" The Treasury estimates that UK GDP would be between 5.4 per cent and 9.5 per cent of GDP lower after 15 years if we left the EU with no successor arrangement , with a central estimate of 7.5 per cent . \" <p> It adds : \" The net impact on public sector receipts -- assuming no contributions to the EU and current receipts from the EU are replicated in full -- would be a loss of between ? 38 billion and ? 66 billion per year after 15 years , driven by the smaller size of the economy . \" <p> Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the leaked documents showed quitting the single market would wreck the economy . <p> \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of sheer economic vandalism , \" he said . <p> \" The Liberal Democrats will stand up for Britain 's membership of the single market . <p> \" We can not stand by while this reckless , divisive and uncaring Conservative Government wrecks the UK economy . \" <p> Today , the Guardian reports that one of the Government 's Brexit advisers previously warned that leaving the customs union could cost up to ? 25 billion a year . <p> In response to this report , Tim Farron said : <p> Yesterday we were told hard Brexit will cost more than ? 60 billion , and now we learn that leaving the EU customs union will cost ? 25 billion . The rocketing bill of leaving Europe reveals the huge economic risk we face with a hard Brexit . <p> The Government must tell us its plan for Britain 's future . The reckless handling of Brexit by the Conservative Government has already seen the pound plummet , and that is well before all of the extra costs associated with a hard Brexit impact our country 's economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers of the course the government wants to drag us down -- and are given a say on whether that reflects their vision of leaving the EU . You have to wonder why the Brexiteeers were so keen on a referendum but are n't confident enough in their case to put the reality to the British people for final approval . <p> \" The net impact on public sector receipts -- assuming no contributions to the EU and current receipts from the EU are replicated in full -- would be a loss of between ? 38 billion and ? 66 billion per year after 15 years \" <p> We could choose to bump up income tax bands by 5% , increasing public sector receipts as a proportion of gdp by 0.4% ( shall we just call it tax , eh ? ) . <p> This too might result in a similar ? 38-66billion over fifteen years , is this too economic vandalism ? Or , perhaps merely a policy choice resulting from political choices reflecting public preferences ... <p> \" We can not stand by while this reckless , divisive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given the high-stakes game of poker currently being played , I 'm holding my judgement on the government 's actual position until the self-imposed deadline for invoking article 50 has passed . SO whilst \" It 's important that the British people know the dangers of the course the government wantsBrexit supporters want to drag us down \" we need to be careful , as has been pointed out elsewhere the EU Commission is doing much to make Remain unattractive ; although the Commission might soften its stance if the UK does a U-turn and goes hard Remain ... <p> I believe our policy is to have the closest possible relationship with the EU . We have a whole bunch of petitions out there trying to protect specific things like science funding and Erasmus , which clearly acknowledge that continued full membership is unlikely . <p> I do n't see any inconsistency at all in a position that says \" Remain is best , but soft Brexit is better than hard Brexit \" <p> Kier Starmer 's 170 questions . Excellent Opposition work that has taken him just a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the three plus months that Labour left the field to us , rather than the sporadic outraged blustering that our Leader thinks is the right approach ? <p> David Evershed -- I understood was that our policy was to argue for a future mandate by referendum or election to halt leaving , or to rejoin , but whilst we have only the 8 MPs and the government still has a mandate to pursue exit , we will argue that any deal needs to be put to the people and / or parliament , and that any deal that is forged should include free movement of people and continued entry of the single market . <p> It is n't that hard to understand , really . <p> What do people want the party to do ? <p> Parade Nick , Paddy and Tim through the streets in sackcloth and ashes repenting for ever having wanted the nation to be an EU member ? <p> ( NB -- That does seem to be what the Mail wants all Remainer politicians to do , judging from recent front pages ... ) <p> \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a destination . When the deal is negotiated , in however many years ' time , the British people must have a chance to say if they would prefer the new arrangement , outside the European Union , or would prefer to remain inside the European Union \" <p> Despite in an earlier section saying there should n't re-run a referendum to get the result you like , the above quote does exactly that . <p> The UK voted to Leave ( destination is outside the EU ) -- so returning to the EU should NOT be an option . In anycase if you did it would be accepting the euro and re-negotiating all our previous opt-outs . <p> We do n't actually know what the Government will decide Hard or Soft Brexit . The Lib Dems should be arguing -- along with other parties -- including most Tory MPs for membership of the Single Market but outside the EU ( as people voted to leave ) <p> In some ways the Lib Dems are like the Tory Right/UKIP -- both have \" absolutist \" views on the EU . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any companies that have Passporting rights have taken them up . Services are tariff free and Japan exports a huge value of them into the EU . Companies can use Mifid 2 Equivalence rights , no issue for us as fully complaint service providers and in the worst case we open a brass plate on a desk in Dublin . <p> I use all manner of American services from American Express to Twitter , Google to Microsoft and my house contains Pringles , Sony , Panasonic , Roland and pants from China , no trade deal was present . <p> By value 70% of our exports are under WTO rules , and this includes some exports into EU . Even if a full average 4% tariff is applied it would make almost no difference to us , here why ; take a bottle of French wine . The tariff applied is on the factory gate price , not the retail price . From vineyard to wholesaler , exporter and the rest , the supply chain is about 6 players long . Each of these will absorb a part of this tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of course as we import double that we export , the Exchequer collects double the tariffs Brussels would . <p> Now add into this the vast untapped benefits our new found trading status affords us , and the world is our oyster . <p> Tim would do very well to read the ground breaking book Futurebabble , which tracks many of the key predictions made by economists and social scientists in the last 100 years . What you discover is that the vast majority of them got it wrong . Even recently when oil was $130 a barrel , the economics consensus said $200 was a . Almost certainty . Guess what , oils prices collapsed to $30 . <p> Tim history does not judge those well that make shrill hysterical predictions . A calm head attending to ALL the evidence and opportunities will give you greater vision <p> Compassionate Brexit . There are many reasons to view Breixt as a vehicle to spread compassion . Take for example the Ghanian tomatoe growing industry . Thanks to heavily subsidised Italian tinned tomatoes , the EU has almost wiped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime , able to trade with Ghanian farmers . <p> Germany makes vastly more from coffee than all the growers in Africa put together , another symptom of the hammer blow inflicted by EU protectionism . <p> Brexit really is a people 's revolution with the ability to unlock global potential . <p> I notice that Siobhab Benita , who stood as an Independent for London Mayor ( she can 5th ) has just joined us , partly on the basis of our position on Brexit . We can use Brexit to win over new voters as well . <p> Whatever the 27 member states of the EU and the European Parliament do agree to for the UK , they will make sure that it must be inferior to what would be on offer for the UK as a full member , therefore I would expect that advocating rejoining would always be an option to argue for . <p> Of course , not leaving in the first place would be better . Although I do not expect this , I also do not completely rule it out . Nonetheless much damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract funding is already taking place , so the consequences of the referendum vote will always be negative to some degree . <p> Since we have no idea of the Brexit plan as the Tories refuse to say , any projection of damage is highly speculative guesswork , even if there were any precedents to educate a guess . It 's unlikely given the muppets in charge but it is possible we might even benefit economically from Brexit . In the meantime , difficult though it is , it is pointless , even destructive , to devise policy around a complete unknown . Egg on face being a big risk . Just wait and see . <p> @John B : You keep saying the UK public voted Leave , and so there should not no option on the table of the UK remaining in or rejoining the UK . Likewise , the UK voted for a Conservative government at the last election . By your logic , this means that there should be no criticism of the Conservative government or of any of its policies . The people have spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in government , and there must be no option of anyone else ever forming a government . <h> Post a Comment <p> Lib Dem Voice welcomes comments from everyone but we ask you to be polite , to be on topic and to be who you say you are .
