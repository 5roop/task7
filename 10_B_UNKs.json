On the basis of Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, Article 28 line 3 and Article 71 of the Book of Procedures of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 18 May 2011, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia passed the following The initiative for instigation of proceedings to appraise the constitutionality of Article 175 of the Code noted in item 1 of this Resolution IS DISMISSED. Given the said constitutional provisions it arises that in this part of the norms of the Constitution no difference is made between active voting right, that is, the citizen's right to vote and the passive voting right, that is, the citizen's right to be elected. Under Article 175 of the same Code, six constituencies are defined in the Republic of Macedonia, in which the territory of the municipalities and the polling stations for each constituency are defined. Given the content of the challenged Article 4 of the Electoral Code, and in correlation with the statements contained in the initiative, according to the Court the definition of a voting right is not disputable. This for a reason that this category is variable, that is, changeable, given the fact that in a certain time period certain number of voters pass away, and certain number of voters gain the voting right, or due to migration changes. Therefore, what imposes as necessary is regular update of the List of Voters, which is made by the competent institutions in certain time distance. The contested paragraph 3 of the same article of this Code stipulates that the number of voters in the constituencies may vary from minus 5% to plus 5% at the most in view of the average number of voters in the constituency, with the exception of the constituencies in Europe and Africa, North and South America, and in Australia and Asia. Under Article 22 of the Constitution, each citizen upon reaching 18 years of age acquires the right to vote. According to the Court, the set diapason \"...minus 5% to plus 5% at the most\" defined in the contested Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Electoral Code is not in disagreement with the constitutional categories of equal voting right of the citizen and his\/her right to take part in the performance of public offices. In this direction, in the determination of the constituencies, which, inter alia, is the subject-matter of regulation of this Code, the legislator dwells on the existing infrastructure of the polling stations and their distribution, pursuant to the proportional model in six constituencies. All this, according to the initiative, was a violation of the constitutional category of an equal voting right of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, that is, equal value of each vote of each voter, and the right of the citizen to take part in the performance of public offices, since it reached devaluation of the weight and value of the votes of the voters. Under Article 22 of the Constitution, each citizen upon reaching 18 years of age acquires the right to vote. However, the Court points out that the equality of the voting right may not be understood with mathematical precision given the different factors as determined and defined, but it must be approximately equal, so that the very code defines certain diapason in the contested paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Electoral Code. This for a reason since, the current situation of the number of voters in the constituencies demonstrated that Constituency 6 numbered 327,479 voters, that is, +7.3% of the average number of voters in a constituency. The Court passed the present resolution in the following composition: the President of the Court Mr Branko Naumoski, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mrs Liljana Ingilizova-Ristova, Mrs Vera Markova, Mr Igor Spirovski, Dr Gzime Starova, Mr Vladimir Stojanoski and Dr Zoran Sulejmanov. On the basis of Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, Article 28 line 3 and Article 71 of the Book of Procedures of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 18 May 2011, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia passed the following This provision is contested with the initiative in view of the equality of the voting right, for a reason that the diapason from plus 5% to minus 5% enables big differences in the value of the votes, and that the current situation of the number of voters in the constituencies exceeds the legally defined diapason, thereby violating the right to equality of the voting right, that is, the votes of the voters from certain constituencies do not have the same value. Given the said constitutional provisions it arises that in this part of the norms of the Constitution no difference is made between active voting right, that is, the citizen's right to vote and the passive voting right, that is, the citizen's right to be elected. On the basis of what has been stated, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of the present Resolution. Hence, given the difference of voters, in particular in Constituency 6 and Constituency 3, the consequence is in the difference of about 5 more seats won. Pursuant to Article 23 of the Constitution, every citizen has the right to take part in the performance of public offices. What was obvious in this case was the violation of the constitutional category of equal voting right of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia (equal value of each vote of every voter). Accordingly, the set difference is not a violation of the principle of equal voting right. The Court passed the present resolution in the following composition: the President of the Court Mr Branko Naumoski, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mrs Liljana Ingilizova-Ristova, Mrs Vera Markova, Mr Igor Spirovski, Dr Gzime Starova, Mr Vladimir Stojanoski and Dr Zoran Sulejmanov. Based on the subject-matter of regulation (Article 1), the Electoral Code, in the most part, contains provisions defining rights and obligations. According to the statements in the initiative, the constitutional-legal affirmations of the freedoms and rights of individual and citizen and political freedoms and rights defined in Article 9 paragraph 2 and Article 22 paragraph 2 of the Constitution did not reflect in the Electoral Code in particular in Article 4 paragraph 2, where the electoral model was defined, and in Article 175, where the constituencies for the election of Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia were defined. Hence, the request for existence of mathematically equal number of votes in each separate constituency may not be sustained, as a result of which, according to the Court, the defined legal diapason in the constituencies for the number of voters to differ from -5% to +5% at the most in view of the average number of voters in the constituency, is not a violation of the constitutionally guaranteed principle of an equal voting right. This for a reason since, the current situation of the number of voters in the constituencies demonstrated that Constituency 6 numbered 327,479 voters, that is, +7.3% of the average number of voters in a constituency. NO PROCEDURE IS INITIATED for the appraisal of the constitutionality of Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos.40\/2006, 136\/2008, 44\/2011 and 51\/2011). All this, according to the initiative, was a violation of the constitutional category of an equal voting right of the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, that is, equal value of each vote of each voter, and the right of the citizen to take part in the performance of public offices, since it reached devaluation of the weight and value of the votes of the voters. Article 1 of this Code stipulates that this law governs the manner, conditions and procedure for the election of the President of the Republic of Macedonia, election of Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, members of the councils of the municipalities and the Council of the City of Skopje, election of a mayor of a municipality and mayor of the City of Skopje, the manner and procedure for registering the voting right, keeping of the List of Voters, determination of the boundaries of the constituencies, and definition, modification and publication of polling stations, as well as the conditions for the functioning of the polling stations. RESOLUTION Text NO PROCEDURE IS INITIATED for the appraisal of the constitutionality of Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", nos.40\/2006, 136\/2008, 44\/2011 and 51\/2011). On the basis of what has been stated, the Court decided as in items 1 and 2 of the present Resolution. According to the Court, the statements noting that the factually excessive differences in the number of voters in the constituencies may be a violation of the constitutional rule for an equal voting right are legitimate and objectively may raise the question about the constitutionality since it is an obligation of the legislator to define the boundaries of the constituencies in which the number of voters should not differ from the diapason set down in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Code, which the Court already found to be constitutionally acceptable. The voting right is constitutionally defined as one of the most fundamental political rights, which corresponds with the other democratic determinations defined by the Constitution, in particular in the part of the organisation and functioning of state authority. The right to vote is equal, universal and direct, and is exercised at free elections by secret ballot. Article 4 of the Electoral Code, which is part of Chapter I, titled: \"Basic provisions\", in subitem 3 titled: \"Electoral model\", in paragraph 2 stipulates that 123 Representatives are elected in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, of whom 120 Representatives are elected based on the proportionality model, whereby the territory of the Republic of Macedonia is divided into six constituencies defined by this Code and 20 Representatives are elected in each of them, and 3 Representatives are elected based on the majority model, that is, one Representative from each of the three constituencies in Europe and Africa, in North and South America, and in Australia and Asia, as defined by this Code. According to the initiative, the Electoral Code should particularly see to the number of voters in the constituencies and in this direction the number of voters to be commensurate in order not to create situations which could lead to the winning of a seat more in any constituency. Given the facts of the case in the initiative it is considered that the current legal position risked the spillover of 5 seats, which led to an improper and inequitable representation of the ethnic communities in the bodies of state power, and inequality of the voting right of the citizen and his right to take part in the carrying out of public offices. Under Article 9 paragraph 2 of the Constitution all citizens are equal before the Constitution and laws. According to the initiative, the challenged legal solutions do not reflect the values defined in the Constitution of an equal voting right, the rights of corresponding and equitable representation. In connection with the statements in the initiative that the defined constituencies differed in the total number of voters, the Court found that the there cannot be a real mathematical equality. According to the statements in the initiative, the constitutional-legal affirmations of the freedoms and rights of individual and citizen and political freedoms and rights defined in Article 9 paragraph 2 and Article 22 paragraph 2 of the Constitution did not reflect in the Electoral Code in particular in Article 4 paragraph 2, where the electoral model was defined, and in Article 175, where the constituencies for the election of Representatives in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia were defined. This provision is contested with the initiative in view of the equality of the voting right, for a reason that the diapason from plus 5% to minus 5% enables big differences in the value of the votes, and that the current situation of the number of voters in the constituencies exceeds the legally defined diapason, thereby violating the right to equality of the voting right, that is, the votes of the voters from certain constituencies do not have the same value. The Court passed the present resolution in the following composition: the President of the Court Mr Branko Naumoski, and the judges: Dr Natasha Gaber-Damjanovska, Mr Ismail Darlishta, Mrs Liljana Ingilizova-Ristova, Mrs Vera Markova, Mr Igor Spirovski, Dr Gzime Starova, Mr Vladimir Stojanoski and Dr Zoran Sulejmanov. Under Article 175 of the same Code, six constituencies are defined in the Republic of Macedonia, in which the territory of the municipalities and the polling stations for each constituency are defined. The voting right is constitutionally defined as one of the most fundamental political rights, which corresponds with the other democratic determinations defined by the Constitution, in particular in the part of the organisation and functioning of state authority. However, given the fact that with the Law on Changing and Supplementing the Electoral Code (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.51\/2011), which was adopted after the initiative had been submitted, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia made a change in Article 175 of the Electoral Code, in the direction of eliminating the problem indicated in the initiative and thereby a change in the polling stations was made, and also in the number of voters in the constituencies, and in particular in Constituency 6, which is underlined in the initiative, the Court found that there are no process presuppositions for the Court to decide meritoriously on this part of the initiative, whereby the procedural presuppositions in Article 28 line 3 of the Book of Procedures of the Court for dismissal of the same are met. The Party for New Democracy \u2013 Democracija e Re submitted an initiative to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia to instigate proceedings for the appraisal of the constitutionality of the articles from the Code noted in item 1 of this Resolution. On the basis of Article 110 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, Article 28 line 3 and Article 71 of the Book of Procedures of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\", no.70\/1992), at its session held on 18 May 2011, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia passed the following The conduct of the elections in the legal order of the Republic of Macedonia is regulated by the Electoral Code. Given the content of the challenged Article 4 of the Electoral Code, and in correlation with the statements contained in the initiative, according to the Court the definition of a voting right is not disputable. Due to what has been noted, it is proposed that the Constitutional Court instigate proceedings for the appraisal of the constitutionality of the contested articles of the Electoral Code and at the same time it is requested that an interim measure be pronounced for discontinuation of the performance of all actions taken on the basis of the contested articles until a final decision is made. Pursuant to Article 23 of the Constitution, every citizen has the right to take part in the performance of public offices. The Party for New Democracy \u2013 Democracija e Re submitted an initiative to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Macedonia to instigate proceedings for the appraisal of the constitutionality of the articles from the Code noted in item 1 of this Resolution. Hence, given the difference of voters, in particular in Constituency 6 and Constituency 3, the consequence is in the difference of about 5 more seats won."

After the planting was completed, everybody gathered around the barbeque, having lunch together, chatting and enjoying the sunny Saturday afternoon. Our Family Green Day can be extended to an Open Green Day encouraging also all people from the local community to participate and we can all plant more and more trees together. On the green area close to the planting site, a party was organized, including a playground for young children under the wide tents. About 270 people, Usje employees together with their families and friends, inhabitants of the houses nearby, and some cooperating companies' employees, planted around 1000 trees, including acacia, juniper, white ash and pine trees in the marl quarry and the adjustment access roads. More than 50 employees' children and grand-children enjoyed their time there and all received an illustration book on protecting the nature. This was an excellent opportunity to do something positive for nature, to enhance our close environment and also for ourselves. This Family Green Day under the motto \"Together for the Nature\" had a goal of raising the level of environmental care amongst our employees and their families by planting trees in our marl quarry and strengthening our team spirit by this joint activity."

Given the fact that the place of residence of the Sun God is in Macedonia, with the throne located at the Alshar mine[1], Jesus as the son of God is born in Paradise on the Planet, in Macedonia, on the coast of Lake Ohrid, in the cave near the village of Kaneo, or the Matka canyon. It is then that chaos began on these two continents.

In the falcified ancient Macedonian history the Macedonians were called barbarians, and so the sublime meaning of Pagoonite as Upper Creators was brutally transformed into pagans.\"[1] The Macedonian faith of THE TRUTH is the very same Christian religion, but with slight modifications and prohibitions (such as canons), the ban on mentioning the Macedonian name amongst others, even though it is mentioned 27 times in the Bible. It is faith in science, art and the word of God. A hundred years before the birth of Alexander of Macedon, ALIENATED Macedonians appeared in Zeta Macedonia Europe and Zeta Macedonia Uprising. The inscription indicates the fact that the Macedonians from the present-day territory of Germany pray to Macedonian for the \u201cTesht\u201d (Father-in-law) \u2013 Sun God, to uprise from Macedonia, so that Zeta Macedonia Europe should enter spring.

The project aimed to increase the capacity of the Secretariat for European Affairs for efficient inter-ministerial coordination of the EU integration process, based on the exchange of experience with the EU member states (twinning partners). While the main beneficiary of this twinning project was the Secretariat for European Affairs, it also involved a number of other institutions, in particular the working committee for European integration and almost all working groups involved in the National programme for approximation of the acquis. Other institutions that had direct benefit from the project are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Legislative Secretariat and the General Secretariat. It identified the areas where additional efforts will be needed. This exercise included 800 civil servants, members of the working groups involved in the National programme for approximation of the acquis. A closing event marked Thursday in Skopje the end of EU-funded twinning project 'Further strengthening of the organisational and institutional capacities for the EU integration process'. The twinning project reviewed all documents transposing EU regulations, prepared in the past 10 years, in order to determine the level of country preparedness for all chapters of the acquis. The project was implemented by a consortium of three EU countries: Germany, Poland and Croatia, including experts from Bulgaria. All countries, involved in the project, have offered their experiences related to various aspects of the functioning of the European Union, Vice-Premier for European Affairs Arbr Ademi said at the closing conference, commending the readiness of Germany, Poland and Croatia to convey their expertise to Macedonia's Secretariat for European Affairs and other institutions - direct beneficiaries of the project. This includes procedures for transposition of EU regulations (acquis), better management of the translation process, improved coordination and monitoring of the use of EU funds, and enhanced inter-ministerial communication among the key line institutions involved in the accession process.

      "text":"In the continuation of the session, trainers explained a short message creation technique called \"KISS- Keep it short and simple\" which means \"be short and clear\". In the fifth session titled \"Message Speakers\", through practical exercises for watching and listening to videos and verbal and non-verbal speech, we can understand the messages the interlocutor wants to convey. One Minute Messages was the theme of the second session. The first day was reserved for presenting the theoretical part on message delivery, and the second and third days for practical exercises on how to properly convey messages by listening recordings and discussion.. To use this method effectively and correctly it should contain the following 7 elements: to be complete, concise, careful, connected, clear, accurate and patient. The purpose of this exercise for the participants was to describe the photograph in one sentence and to convey a message. It is therefore much easier to speak an hour than to create a short, concise, effective, inspirational and clear message. The second day of training began with the third session entitled \"One Picture \u2013 A Thousand Words\". It is often easier to devise a speech or talk for an hour than to say two or three minutes. The first session began with a reminder to the participants who attended the last seminar on \"Public Speaking and Performance\" about what they have learnt and how they applied it in their daily activities. In the period of 5-7 July 2019 in Ohrid, a summer training was hosted on the topic \"Dissemination of Messages\", in cooperation with Radio Pela.

In this session the participants had to hear a certain message and convey it. When we want to convey a message we need to use a short message creation technique called \"KISS \u2013 Keep it short and simple\". The trainers told one of the participants the story \"Grandpa and the turnip\". Nowadays when people have less time to listen and read, it is important to be brief and clear in order to convey the message effectively. The fourth session, titled \"Create a Short Message\", started with a separate breakdown of the topics by the trainees, for which the participants had to write a short message on the topic. Then the participants had to tell the story to each other separately, and the message they had to deliver was \"Together we can learn much more\". The training was attended by thr Community promoters who learned, practiced and at the same time built mutual trust in delivering messages of individual and collective interest. The participants, together with the organizers and the trainers, took a joint photo. Participants were actively involved in the overall message dissemination training process, which ultimately resulted in encouraged volunteers to communicate with the community in order to properly and accurately deliver messages on the needs and issues of the Roma population."

      "text":"In the United States, resistant infections cause about 23,000 deaths and more than two million illnesses annually with costs of US$35 billion American dollars. The overuse of antibiotics makes resistant bacteria more common. Incorrectly prescribed antibiotics promote antibiotic resistance by supporting genetic alterations in the bacteria. Incorrectly prescribed antibiotics promote antibiotic resistance by supporting genetic alterations in the bacteria. The World Health Organisation has recommended surveillance programs to monitor antimicrobial resistance. In summary, antimicrobial resistance happens when bacteria, virus, fungi, or parasites develop resistance to antibiotics that were commonly used to treat them. That is, patients seeing a general practitioner often expect them to prescribe antibiotics. In Australia, there were such programs for systemic infections but not for ocular infections. Hand hygiene is the most important way of preventing the spread of infections. Surveillance programs for antimicrobial resistance were recommended by the World Health Organization, Global Action Plan to support disease prevention and control strategies. \u00b7 Inappropriate prescribing: studies in the United States have reported that treatment indication, choice of medication or duration of antibiotic therapy was incorrect in 30 to 50% of patients in 2014. In the United States, resistant infections cause about 23,000 deaths and more than two million illnesses annually with costs of US$35 billion American dollars. The eye doctor will perform a corneal scrape and will start appropriate antibiotics. \u00b7 Poor hygiene and poor infection prevention and control: this can provide more opportunity for resistant bacteria to spread and make more people sick increasing the need for antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance is a health threat worldwide as having a significant potential impact on treatment outcomes. In Australia, there were such programs for systemic infections but not for ocular infections. A MRSA infection is caused by a type of staphylococcus aureus bacteria that becomes resistant to many antibiotics used to treat common infections. But I think it is a measure of resistance to microbes occurring in the eye. The more we use antibiotics, the more chances bacteria have to become resistant to them. These patients were more likely to have poor vision after the resolution of the infection, delay in the healing of the ulcer and perforation of the cornea needing a corneal transplantation. Similarly, 25,000 deaths per year related to resistant infections occur in Europe. Do not self-treat with over-the-counter antibiotics such as Chlorsig as it may not work for the bacteria causing the infection. In Australia, the most common bacteria causing corneal infections are Staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. But what is antimicrobial resistance? These strategies include evidence-based antibiotic prescribing guidelines based on local and regional data. \u00b7 What antimicrobial resistance is; The more we use antibiotics, the more chances bacteria have to become resistant to them. Today, we are going to talk about antimicrobial resistance in corneal infections as it has become such an important issue that the World Health Organisation has a global action plan to combat this resistance. We found that one in two episodes had been treated with other antibiotics within the last 14 days prior to the presentation to the hospital, and the duration of the symptoms was between 3-8 days. Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally over time, usually through genetic changes, but antibiotic use makes it worse. I think it is when the virus or bacteria creates a resistance to drugs that are supposed to kill them. First, I will give a brief introduction about antimicrobial resistance, and later we are going to explore some research on antimicrobial resistance in corneal infections in Australia. More on the results of the antimicrobial resistance surveillance program up next\u2026 But I think it is a measure of resistance to microbes occurring in the eye. A bacterial corneal infection is an ocular emergency needing an immediate and effective antibiotic treatment as it can progress very rapidly, causing visual impairment and, potentially, blindness. A bacterial corneal infection is an ocular emergency needing an immediate and effective antibiotic treatment as it can progress very rapidly, causing visual impairment and, potentially, blindness. Some causes are: \u00b7 Overuse of antibiotics: when we use antibiotics, some bacteria die but resistant bacteria can survive and multiply. But what is antimicrobial resistance? In fact, a survey showed that one in five patients would ask the doctor to prescribe antibiotics. This suggested that the rise in use of Chlorsig was due to recommendations by pharmacists or optometrists. In the United States, resistant infections cause about 23,000 deaths and more than two million illnesses annually with costs of US$35 billion American dollars. Therefore, there is a need to undertake antimicrobial resistance surveillance to determine the suitability of the initial antibiotic therapy for bacterial corneal infections given the challenge of organisms becoming resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, there is a risk of disease spread, severe disease and even death, and for eye infection cases: loss of sight or even the eye. But by looking at the words, I think it is something to do with bacteria, the body develops immune system against certain bacteria, so we won\u2019t get sick or it is something like when you take antibiotics, and it doesn\u2019t work anymore because the body is used to certain types of antibiotics. \u00b7 Poor hygiene and poor infection prevention and control: this can provide more opportunity for resistant bacteria to spread and make more people sick increasing the need for antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally over time, usually through genetic changes, but antibiotic use makes it worse. Incorrectly prescribed antibiotics promote antibiotic resistance by supporting genetic alterations in the bacteria. Moreover, in Australia in the same year, a study showed that half of general practitioners prescribed antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections to meet patient\u2019s expectations. In Australia, the most common bacteria causing corneal infections are Staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The more we use antibiotics, the more chances bacteria have to become resistant to them. There are significant collateral costs of this infection, for example: a reduced quality of life for those affected and an increased health-system burden. An antimicrobial is something that can treat any microbe. Antimicrobial resistance happens when bacteria, virus, fungi, or parasites change overtime and then cannot respond to the medications which makes them harder or impossible to treat. \u00b7 Some causes of antimicrobial resistance; and And what to do to prevent resistance to antibiotics? Dr. Maria Cabrera talks about what antimicrobial resistance is, some causes of antimicrobial resistance, and how to prevent antimicrobial resistance in corneal infections. The transcript is available in the 'Transcript' tab on this page. Some causes of antimicrobial resistance are overuse of antibiotics, incorrect antibiotic prescribing by clinicians, and lack of hygiene and infection control. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimated that an average of 290 deaths is caused by eight resistant bacteria each year in Australia, and that the cost to the health systems of Australia, the United States and Canada combined will be of US$74 billion American dollars between 2015 and 2050 from such resistance. The overuse of antibiotics makes resistant bacteria more common. Therefore, as a patient you can do these three things to avoid having a corneal infection resistant to the antibiotics: Today, we are going to talk about antimicrobial resistance in corneal infections as it has become such an important issue that the World Health Organisation has a global action plan to combat this resistance. Some causes of antimicrobial resistance are overuse of antibiotics, incorrect antibiotic prescribing by clinicians, and lack of hygiene and infection control. In Australia, there were surveillance programs for systemic infections, but not for ocular infections. Email us at [email protected] or share on Twitter with the hashtag sydeyepod, that\u2019s Hashtag S-Y-D-E-Y-E-P-O-D. Now, more on the research of antimicrobial resistance and surveillance programs To find the organism causing a corneal infection, a corneal scraping is performed. So, what causes antimicrobial resistance? Therefore, as a patient you can do these three things to avoid having a corneal infection resistant to the antibiotics: Moreover, one of the participants mentioned that she had heard about MRSA which stands for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. And what to do to prevent resistance to antibiotics? Do not self-treat with over-the-counter antibiotics such as Chlorsig as it may not work for the bacteria causing the infection."

      "text":"This stable cost structure paired with steady business growth underlines the scaling potential of the ProCredit group's business model. The comfortable capitalisation of the ProCredit group is reflected particularly in the leverage ratio, which at 9.2% is well above the average for the banking sector. This includes green loans, which increased by EUR 33 million in the first quarter of 2021, accounting for more than 20% of the EUR 158 million in total portfolio growth during the period. Consolidated result of EUR 15.6 million represents improved return on equity of 7.9%; positive result contribution from all ProCredit banks If you are a legal entity and want to make foreign exchange purchases with a speacial exchange rate, please fill out the following application. As of 31 March 2021, the green loan portfolio exceeded EUR 1 billion for the first time, representing 18.8% of the total loan portfolio. At EUR 12.0 million, net fee and commission income was at the level recorded in the previous year (Q1 2020: EUR 12.0 million). Guidance for the 2021 financial year confirmed ProCredit with significant portfolio growth and improved consolidated result in first quarter of 2021 building on solid 2020 financial year Guidance for the 2021 financial year confirmed The consolidated result for the first quarter of 2021 and the consolidated result for the second half of 2020 have not yet been recognised in CET1 capital. After working hours of the bank, all exchange operations will be processed with the Official Exchange Rate of the bank. The consolidated result increased to EUR 15.6 million (Q1 2020: EUR 13.7 million), representing an improved return on equity of 7.9% (Q1 2020: 7.0%). Green loan portfolio exceeds the EUR 1 billion mark for the first time and now accounts for 18.8% of the total loan portfolio In the first quarter of 2021, portfolio quality remained broadly stable at year-end 2020 levels. The customer loan portfolio grew by EUR 158 million or 3.0%, significantly stronger than the first quarter of the previous year (Q1 2020: EUR 42 million, 0.9%). ProCredit with significant portfolio growth and improved consolidated result in first quarter of 2021 The ProCredit group's quarterly financial report for Q1 2021 is available as of today on the ProCredit Holding website under Investor Relations at https:\/\/www.procredit-holding.com\/en\/investor-relations\/reports-publications\/financial-reports\/ . The consolidated result for Q1 2021 includes loss allowance expenses amounting to EUR 3.6 million (Q1 2020: EUR 6.9 million); this is reflected in a lower annualised cost of risk at 27 basis points (Q1 2020: 57 basis points). As of 31 March 2021, the green loan portfolio exceeded EUR 1 billion for the first time, representing 18.8% of the total loan portfolio. The consolidated result increased to EUR 15.6 million (Q1 2020: EUR 13.7 million), representing an improved return on equity of 7.9% (Q1 2020: 7.0%). The customer loan portfolio grew by EUR 158 million or 3.0%, significantly stronger than the first quarter of the previous year (Q1 2020: EUR 42 million, 0.9%). Frankfurt am Main, 12 May 2021 \u2013 The ProCredit group, which is mainly active in South Eastern and Eastern Europe, started the 2021 financial year with good Q1 results. After working hours of the bank, all exchange operations will be processed with the Official Exchange Rate of the bank. This stable cost structure paired with steady business growth underlines the scaling potential of the ProCredit group's business model. The portfolio growth in the first quarter of 2021 is attributable to ProCredit's strong market position as a \"Hausbank\" for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The consolidated result for the second half of 2020 will be recognised in CET1 capital after the Annual General Meeting 2021, with one third also being set aside for dividends. Furthermore, a change in allocation between net interest income and loss allowance items of EUR 1.3 million from the first quarter of 2021 onwards has contributed to the reduction in net interest income compared with the previous year's figure, although this change will have no effect on the overall result. In view of the still tense macroeconomic situation caused by the pandemic and in line with their strong ESG positioning, ProCredit banks aim to continue to actively support SME clients in coping with the crisis and to finance their longer-term investment projects. Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio remains at robust level Cost-income ratio at 64.8% slightly below the guidance corridor of 65% - 68% for the year as a whole The consolidated result for the first quarter of 2021 and the consolidated result for the second half of 2020 have not yet been recognised in CET1 capital. Personnel and administrative expenses declined by EUR 1.1 million to EUR 40.7 million in the first quarter, despite strong portfolio growth. Net interest income stood at EUR 49.3 million, which was lower than the Q1 2020 figure of EUR 50.9 million, primarily due to the base rate cuts made in the COVID year 2020. The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1 fully loaded) as of 31 March 2021 was 13.2%, and thus at the end-2020 level. Based on the positive developments in the first quarter, the Management Board confirms the guidance for the financial year as set out in the 2020 annual financial statements. Personnel and administrative expenses declined by EUR 1.1 million to EUR 40.7 million in the first quarter, despite strong portfolio growth. This amount corresponds to 20 basis points of the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the ProCredit group, which is the maximum level under the European Central Bank recommendation on dividend distributions valid until 30 September 2021. The ProCredit group continues to deduct one third of all profits recognised from the 2019 consolidated result and the consolidated result from the first half of 2020 for future dividend payments from CET1 capital. Solid risk profile serves as foundation for good financial results Based on the positive developments in the first quarter, the Management Board confirms the guidance for the financial year as set out in the 2020 annual financial statements. The ProCredit group's quarterly financial report for Q1 2021 is available as of today on the ProCredit Holding website under Investor Relations at https:\/\/www.procredit-holding.com\/en\/investor-relations\/reports-publications\/financial-reports\/ . Growth in customer loans by 3.0% and in customer deposits by 2.5% underscore the group's strong positioning as reliable partner for SMEs and its growing foothold as a transparent direct bank for private clients At EUR 12.0 million, net fee and commission income was at the level recorded in the previous year (Q1 2020: EUR 12.0 million). The cost-income ratio stood at 64.8% and is slightly below the guidance corridor of 65% - 68% for the year as a whole (Q1 2020: 64.6%). ProCredit with significant portfolio growth and improved consolidated result in first quarter of 2021 Net interest income stood at EUR 49.3 million, which was lower than the Q1 2020 figure of EUR 50.9 million, primarily due to the base rate cuts made in the COVID year 2020. This was partly due to lower travel activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Frankfurt am Main, 12 May 2021 \u2013 The ProCredit group, which is mainly active in South Eastern and Eastern Europe, started the 2021 financial year with good Q1 results. In the first quarter of 2021, portfolio quality remained broadly stable at year-end 2020 levels. The consolidated result for the second half of 2020 will be recognised in CET1 capital after the Annual General Meeting 2021, with one third also being set aside for dividends. As of 31 March 2021, the share of credit-impaired loans in the total portfolio was 2.7% (31 December 2020: 2.6%); the share of loans in Stage 2 showed a slight decline by 0.3 percentage points to 4.6%. This was partly due to lower travel activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1 fully loaded) as of 31 March 2021 was 13.2%, and thus at the end-2020 level. All ProCredit banks made positive result contributions in Q1 2021, leading to an improved consolidated result. The cost-income ratio stood at 64.8% and is slightly below the guidance corridor of 65% - 68% for the year as a whole (Q1 2020: 64.6%). All ProCredit banks made positive result contributions in Q1 2021, leading to an improved consolidated result. The improved result is largely attributable to a decline in loss allowances to EUR 3.6 million, lowering the annualised cost of risk to 27 basis points (Q1 2020: 57 basis points; EUR 6.9 million). This includes green loans, which increased by EUR 33 million in the first quarter of 2021, accounting for more than 20% of the EUR 158 million in total portfolio growth during the period. A reduction in liquidity placements with central banks had a positive effect in the first quarter of 2021, counteracting the effects of significant portfolio growth. Annualised cost of risk at 27 basis points, below previous year's level; credit risk indicators remain solid The Management Board and Supervisory Board have proposed a dividend distribution of EUR 0.18 per ordinary share for resolution at the Annual General Meeting scheduled for 27 May 2021. A reduction in liquidity placements with central banks had a positive effect in the first quarter of 2021, counteracting the effects of significant portfolio growth. Customer deposits also showed very good growth of EUR 123 million or 2.5% in the first quarter of 2021 (Q1 2020: decrease of 1.7% or EUR 74 million). The comfortable capitalisation of the ProCredit group is reflected particularly in the leverage ratio, which at 9.2% is well above the average for the banking sector. The expenses recorded are mainly attributable to additional loss allowances for credit-impaired loans and to the portfolio growth achieved. The increase in deposits was mainly in the area of sight deposits and savings deposits and can be attributed in particular to direct banking business with private customers."

The Czech Republic (at the time of writing) has the highest Covid-19 related death rate in the world, and has had four health ministers in seven months. For the Czech government, this revelation justifies the decision to expel 18 Russian diplomats, believed to conduct or co-ordinate intelligence operations in the Czech Republic, giving them 48 hours to leave the country. In this charged climate, Czech politicians are divided into those calling for closer ties with Russia, and those who warn that Moscow cannot be trusted. Czech police have issued a warrant for two Russian citizens present near Vrb\u011btice at the time of the explosions, known under their assumed names as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. Prague is fully aware of the consequences of \"such tricks\". In May last year, Prague authorities decided to remove the statue of a Soviet Marshal, Ivan Konev, who is considered in Russia to have been a \"liberator of Czechoslovakia from the Nazis\". Czech social media lit up in the wake of the announcement by Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 (who had appeared at the press conference with Interior Minister and interim Foreign Minister Jan Ham\u00e1\u010dek), as the country and its political scene reacted to what are grave allegations, given the significance of Czech-Russian relations.

Three cases of supracondylar process of the humerus are presented. Also, motor and sensory functions of the nerves and muscle strength were within normal limits and Tinel and Phalen tests were negative in all three cases. The supracondylar spur has a prevalence of 0.3% - 2.7%. It is believed to represent a phylogenetic vestige of the supracondyloid foramen found in reptiles, cats and climbing animals. Ultrasound findings determined: ultrasonographic soft shadow, in addition to a soft tissue, suspicious for a cartilage exostosis. The main features of a supracondylar process correlated with osteochondroma are reviewed. Family relation is obvious in our case - father and two daughters. We suggest a follow-up of the spur's growth in both children and to re-investigate in a 6 month interval, because of the non-completion of the spatial growth. George Zafiroski Special Hospital for Surgical Diseases \"Filip Vtori\" - Skopje, Republic of Macedonia Abstract The spur or the supracondylar process variation of the humerus was first described by Struthers in 1849. No one of our three patients underwent surgical interventions, because no one of them had median nerve compression or long standing pain. No anomalies were identified on neurography and electromyography. Hereditary supracondylar spur of the humerus: Case report No one of them had compression symptoms or pain. They accidentally revealed the outgrowth: the father during bathing, and in two children during bathing and dressing. Radiographic findings are identical in all three cases: native radiography of the skeleton on the right elbow, on the medial side of the distal right humerus presented soft tissue shadow like the avian spur, with a broad background associated with the skeleton; suspect cartilage exostose findings."

Joelle Moughanni builds on the previous issue\u2019s guest contributor and focuses on the much discussed disclosure debate (and IASB\u2019s initiative) in a selection of the ten most relevant questions and answers. As we enter into the second decade of IFRS in Europe, in this issue we reflect on the lessons learnt from the past and on what we should look forward to in the next decade. If the recent capital market trends are anything to go by, investment funds, private equity and venture capital will continue to play a prominent role in our economies. Therefore, our author from Singapore, Chee Wee Lock, addresses the challenges and the advantages of the additional information required in the context of consolidation (and exemption from consolidation) of investment entities\u2019 subsidiaries. Our guest contributor, Dr Nigel Sleigh-Johnson, Head of the Financial Reporting Faculty at ICAEW, shared with us his insightful views, providing a start to the New Year under the best auspices of a promising new decade of IFRS."

The active ingredient in marijuana is delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol. For short, THC. This is the euphoriant, which means it causes a euphoric state after consumption. It is common for marijuana smokers to complain of wheezing, coughing and lung congestion. The reservoir at the bottom of a bong is filled with water and the smoke passes through the water before reaching the mouth. While there is a shortage of conclusive research in the area, it appears that heavy marijuana smokers are more prone to lung cancer and emphysema, like tobacco smokers are. These are only a few of the many reports that point to smoked marijuana use posing a danger to the health of the lungs. Changes in the lungs\u2019 ability to protect themselves from infection has been associated with higher chance of illness. Let\u2019s take a look at what information is available on the health risks of cannabis, known in the US as marijuana. A bong is a long, glass pipe that cools the smoke before it is inhaled.

As a result of the increased requirements to civil aviation, 1966 saw the establishment of the State Economic Association \"Bulgarian Civil Aviation\" with the following sub-divisions: In 1948 the Law on Aviation came into force and it went through a series of amendments over the years until the Civil Aviation Act of the Republic of Bulgaria evolved. On 3 February 1969 by its Ordinance No. 37 the Council of Ministers set up the Air Traffic Services Directorate as a separate entity and an autonomous structure of the State Economic Association \"Bulgarian Civil Aviation\", its main function being the provision of air navigation services in the civil airspace of the Republic of Bulgaria. The establishment of BULATSA is the result of a chain of events in the history of Bulgarian civil aviation: Following a government decision the first civil aircraft were procured in 1922 and thus the beginning of civil aviation was laid in Bulgaria. The first internal flight with a route Sofia - Varna - Rousse was performed on 8 November 1927. In 1946 a Directorate on Air Communications was established subordinated to the Council of Ministers."

Raise awareness on the harm to people's health caused by the illicit trade in tobacco products, especially the youth and low-income groups, due to the increased accessibility and affordability of these products due to their lower costs. In order to deal with this problem, in November 2012, the international community has accepted the Protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products, the WHO's first report under the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). Promote the ratification of, accession to and use of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products by all Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) and its early entry into force through the active involvement of all relevant stakeholders. On the occasion of World No tobacco Day in 2015 urged the countries to work together to stop the illicit trade in tobacco products.

      "text":"This is especially important for the media professionals. The media content titled \"The Jewish tribe\", and the silence of the institutions cannot be interpreted otherwise, when they, according to the Law on Criminal Procedure, have instruments against anybody who \"approves or justifies genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes\". Article 407-a from this law states: The Holocaust reminds us that if we forget it, evil will have open doors, and it will be only a matter of time when evil will destroy the human civilization. In fact, one who is silent and recognizes evil, is not a good person at all. (1) One who publicly denies, harshly minimizes, approves and justifies the acts from Article 403 to Article 407 via information systems, shall be sentenced from one to five years of imprisonment. In fact, one who is silent about evil is not a good person at all. (2) If the denying, minimizing, approving or justifying are perpetrated with an intention of spurring hatred, discrimination or violence against certain person or group due to their national, ethnic, racial affiliation or religion, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to at least four years of imprisonment. Hence, the scream of the 6 million civil Jewish victims, executed in most gruesome manner during World War II, sends a warning that we should always be aware of evil and that evil is not once and for all conquered. It is an everlasting battle, because evil and hatred are hidden in each of us and in everyone around us. With a goal to annihilate the rival Jewish tribe\". Jurists are, of course, the authority on this, but it seems like the aforementioned text contains elements that could be covered by this Article. Not only we render homage to the victims when we remember them, but we also vouch that we haven't forgoten and we shall not forget. Therefore, silent journalists are not good journalists. That's every progressive humans' duty and the journalists have a special place as first line guards. NOBODY IS BORN GOOD Another very important lesson from this mournful period of human history is the realisation that the silence about evil, the hushing up of the signs and the presence of evil, makes us allies of evil. In the 1930s, the world had been watching the events taking place in Germany but remained silent. The quote is a part of the conspiracy theories, but of course, that is not a justification for somebody who considers himself\/herself a media professional to disseminate and to affirm this dreadful phantasmagoria. A verse of the Torah, the sacred Pentateuch of the Judaism, says: \"The imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth\" (Gen. 8:21). The human becomes a good person by building his\/hers character by continuously defeating temptations caused by the basic living instincts and by adopting the understanding that there is somebody else besides him\/her or above him\/her. There are certain things that humankind must not forget. There are organizations, groups and individuals in the world that, due to reasons familiar only to them, wish to entirely distort the truth about the Holocaust or to devalue it to the extent of obliterating the importance of this tragic process and to send this lunacy into oblivion. The Holocaust is a severe, tragic lecture that we should always have in our minds and never forget what happens when we make room for monstrous instincts instead of the humane human character. When we are remaining silent about evil or we do not want to recognize it, the evil augments and gains strength. I assert that journalists are not allowed to forget. To be completely frank, we ought to state that the author of the aforementioned quote is not the author of this intimidating, and in the same time, grotesque thesis. Journalists should be familiar with and should approach those things that must not be forgotten accordingly: do everything to understand the darkest pages of humankind's history so they would recognize every new threat. On the other hand, the history is full of lessons teaching us that when good people had risen against evil, they had always been victorious, and the evil had been sent into the most remote parts of hell, where it awaits its new chance. One interpretation of this verse states that nobody is born good. They must not forget the Holocaust, nor any other genocide or crime against humanity. Hence, silent journalists are not good journalists. Therefore, it is important to remember the Holocaust. Whether it gets the chance or not, depends on our vigilance and our readiness not to forget. Keeping all this in mind would be the first step, the first barrier and the first resistance against inhumanity, against dark forces. History teaches us that evil triumphs when good people keep silent. It was too late when the world decided to react, because there were already millions of innocent dead people. While we speak about silent people, we should not forget that the same consequences occur when the institutions remain silent. Macedonia also has its share of advocates of absurd, meaningless and monstrous ideas that the Holocaust had been organized by the Jews themselves, i.e. \"according to forbidden books and research conducted in Germany, Poland and Hungary, there is a much evidence that prove the Ashkenazi are the ideologists, the financiers and the organizers of the Holocaust.

Metropolitan of Paphos George stated that the aim of the dialogue was to clarify the common faith of the Orthodoxies and Roman-Catholics, which existed before the schism.

Through this project, we identified the relevant representatives, prepared national road maps and established national working groups for anti-poison actions. An action that might seem unreal for other countries, but it's actually just a tool and not the most important aspect in solving wildlife crime. Wildlife crime specialists who amassed over 15 years of experience in the field across Europe developed the courses with the overarching goal to convert participants into experts of wildlife crime forensic and police investigation. Next Tuesday on 29 June 2021, conservation, police, toxicology and veterinary professionals from nine countries will come together in Cazorla, Spain, to attend the Wildlife Crime Academy's BASIC level training. Currently, capacities and law enforcement related to wildlife crime hold very low priority in most Balkan countries, so there are almost no convictions or minimal sentences executed. This experience allows the BalkanDetox LIFE project to carry out the necessary awareness activities to position wildlife crime as a priority, and also organise the Wildlife Crime Academy, which is just around the corner! When participants complete all three levels of the WCA over the coming years, they will be able to investigate wildlife crime from the early action and CSI to the final procedure at the Court. The BalkanDetox LIFE project aims to make a change. This means that wildlife criminals, such as people who place poison baits targeting animals, go unpunished, and continue their illegal activities with no consequences. For the past three years, the Vulture Conservation Foundation (VCF) has worked intensively alongside local NGOs and government authorities in Balkans on this issue through the Balkan Anti-Poisoning Project. Secondly, in exactly one week, the first Wildlife Crime Academy (WCA) course will commence in the hope to transfer Spanish expertise and raise capacities to the Balkans and beyond. First course of the Wildlife Crime Academy Overall, the Academy will reinforce operational capacities and coordinate institutional actions to increase detection and improve management of poisoning incidents, facilitate an immediate and effective response to such incidents as well as strengthen enforcement to deter criminal activities."

The euro is divided into 100 cents (also referred to as euro cents, especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). The rates were determined by the Council of the European Union,[note 7] based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of notes and coins in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet strict criteria, such as a budget deficit of less than 3% of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than 60% of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and interest rates close to the EU average.

All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.

      "text":"The space exudes and talks, and the time is here somehow unimportant, an ideal refuge for diverse cultures, available for all contrasts, a little bit sleepy, but extremely open. Notable people from Skopje: - Mother Teresa, humanitarian - Milcjo Mancjevski, film director - Darko Pancjev, former footballer - Simon Trpcjevski, pianist - Srgjan Kerim, former UN General Assembly president - Yahya Kemal Beyatli, poet and diplomat The bridges over the river Vardar bind the left bank - the old city to its right bank. The mountain Suva Gora is located southwest, and behind it there is the amazing Sjar Planina. A strange city, easy-going in his fortune, turned with its sunny face towards the guests, always kind and dear. School of Macedonian Language for foreigners; Macedonian Language school for foreigners; Summer school for Macedonian for foreigners; Macedonian for foreigners; Macedonian as a foreign\/second language; Study Macedonian in Skopje; Learn Macedonian online; Courses of Macedonian for foreigners for basic, intermediate and advanced level Today Skopje is a modern city, capital of the independent Republic of Macedonia. In Skopje you can sit on a stone and not notice that it is part of a former magnificent building. Welcome to the shelter of civilisation! In the old part of the city there are archaeological layers up to 6 m depth. Wherever you go, you must see the Stone Bridge, it is splendid and majestic. Standing on the Stone Bridge you get information about Skopje valley, which is 245 meters above sea level. The clash of the old and new streets and different cultures are intertwined so strangely, that we believe tourists will find wandering around the city as a very interesting activity, and in this way they will reveal the coffers of cultural goods and the brilliance of the ingenious builders. Skopje accepts you, relaxes you and suddenly you are aware of transience. An urban city with unspoken and senseless decisions, as if it is a town lying on another town. Vardar flows noisily, rushing towards the Aegean Sea. There is the mountain Vodno to the south and Skopska Crna Gora to the north. He is at the crossroads of the axes East - West (Asian) and north - south (European) and has always been a place of events, struggles and dialogues."

Pic.3 Works on the back part of the house commence. Pic.6 Montage of water heating collectors on 15 April 2006. The tubes were placed on an isolation surface and galvanised with cement. The data received from this measure station encouraged us to enter in the building of a project, and modifying the house into a form suitable for living where the needs for electricity, sanitary hot water and heating would be fully satisfied by sun and wind at least 8 to 9 months in the year, mainly in spring, summer and fall. Pic.2 A new look of the front of the house (under construction) The water heating system (with the solar power) consists of 5 collectors with the total surface size of 10m2. The construction works commenced on 15 March 2006, with the setup of the inner installation and paintjob. A computer monitoring was set up as well, and it archived the data for the produced and the spent power from the solar panel and the turbine. At this location, there was a weekend- house where in the 2000th, SIETO Installed a 400W wind turbine, 50W a photovoltaic solar panel and 200 Ah accumulator batteries. The latest accomplishments in construction, like the thermal isolation, orientation and placement of the house by the 4 sides of the world, were applied during construction. In the past, this equipment had produced enough electricity to power the full illumination in the house, as well as the radio and the TV. Pic.4 Construction phase at 22. The total size of the house is 192 m2, of which 110 m2 will be used for living, and the rest will be used as basements and utility rooms. The first step that was taken is the adaptation and modification of the front of the existing object. The collectors are pointed south at a 35 degrees to the horizontal axis. Step 2, modifying the back of the house begun in 15 July 2005."

The construction of the third factory and the fourth plant should be completed by mid-2017, and it would create 400 new jobs. In January 2014, it was announced that American corporation Amphenol was going to open a factory in Macedonia, using the existing factory of Atom, from Kochani. According to the abbreviated financial statement, at the end of 2015, Amphenol had 515 employees, while the non-current assets of the company were estimated at 3.3 million euros.

      "text":"These are lessons that the Kurdish masses are learning in the hardest way possible. The US masses are weary of war, and Trump promised to withdraw US troops from the Middle East in his election campaign, something he is intent on living up to in the run-up to his re-election. It has also been reported that the next phase has begun, with incursions into Syrian territory by Turkish forces, along with mercenary Syrian Islamist groups. In reality, Erdogan is trying to re-engineer the ethnic makeup of the area to install an Arab-based protectorate, which is supposed to act as a \u201cbuffer\u201d against the Kurds. But as most people know, this is not due to Muhammad bin Salman\u2019s or Abdelfattah al-Sisi\u2019s particular interest in the democratic rights of the Kurds, but because the Saudis saw the Kurds as a potential anti-Iranian proxy. At every stage, the major steps forward by the Kurdish liberation movement have been on the basis of the revolutionary and class-based movement of the masses and not collaboration with the imperialists. This reaffirms that Erdogan is weak at home and that there is a way into the Turkish army, which can only be defeated by the Kurds if it is broken on class lines. In Syria as well, as we have stated before, it was the all-Syrian revolution \u2013 which was in fact strongest in the west of the country \u2013 that created a power vacuum, which allowed the PYD to take over. Russia and the Assad regime, flanked by Iran, are ready to move in, disarm the Kurds and expand their influence in Syria. This reaffirms that Erdogan is weak at home and that there is a way into the Turkish army, which can only be defeated by the Kurds if it is broken on class lines. Its Iraqi militia organisation, the YBS, has also received funds and wages from the Iraqi central government. These divisions had already been revealed earlier, in the Syrian Civil War where, for instance, the CIA-supported Islamist forces and Pentagon-backed Kurdish forces clashed around the towns of Azaz in 2016, and on many other occasions. But as Trump also correctly pointed out, the US has spent trillions of dollars, and thousands of dead soldiers, on wars in the Middle East fighting for others, such as the European and Gulf rulers. But the interests of the bourgeoisie are totally opposite to those of the millions of poor and oppressed Kurds. On a revolutionary basis, faced by armed mass resistance in Syria as well as in Turkey, the army would come under enormous pressure and the conditions for class-based mutinies would emerge. The same actions need to be taken throughout the region, in particular in Iraq, Iran and Syria, where a call for a united struggle against the hated regimes would find a wide echo. In reality, however, this merely covers for the desire of the PKK leaders to come to an agreement with the bourgeoisie. In Syria as well, multiple concessions by the leaders of the movement have undermined it. If such a course of action is taken boldly and decisively, the Kurds can win against the Turkish army. On the other hand, he sees how a US presence in Syria is pushing Turkey \u2013 a key NATO ally, in which the US has nuclear weapons and an airbase \u2013 into the arms of Russia and Iran. In Turkey as well, the HDP, dominated by the PKK in Kurdish areas of Turkey, held de facto power in a whole series of regions and in large towns such as Cizre, Silopi, Hakkari and Sirknak. On a revolutionary basis, faced by armed mass resistance in Syria as well as in Turkey, the army would come under enormous pressure and the conditions for class-based mutinies would emerge. Furthermore, politicians from both US parties in congress have been criticising Trump. But seeing how that alienated the US\u2019s Gulf allies, it started leaning on the PKK-linked militias in Syria, as a counter-weight to Iran, and later Russia. That is the basis of Erdogan\u2019s hostility towards the Kurds, and his determination to eliminate their autonomous region in Northern Syria. In fact, the PKK, which is the sister organisation of the PYD, remains on the terror list of the US as well as the EU. But the EU leaders are not interested in the rights of the Kurds, or anything else for that matter, except for the interests of their own bourgeoisie. When Erdogan began his war on the Kurds in 2015, the masses of the area rose and were prepared to fight to the end, but the PKK leaders, having plenty of arms, resources and experience from the war in Syria, refused to arm the population or even to call for a general strike \u2013 for fear of antagonising their allies, mainly the US. In fact, the PKK, which is the sister organisation of the PYD, remains on the terror list of the US as well as the EU. At the same time, the Kurdish de-facto independence in Rojava became a powerful beacon for Kurds inside Turkey. But it is a fatal mistake to base oneself on these powers, and to invite them in! But if the Kurdish leaders keep facing towards the imperialists and the bourgeois, defeat is guaranteed one way or another. The Kurdish masses have shown time and time again that they are willing to fight until the last. He criticised the national oppression of the Kurds and opened up talks with the Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan. In fact, this tactic has never brought the Kurdish movement much. We do not have any doubt about efforts in that regard.\u201d That is, the Pentagon was hoping for a swift victory for Turkey! When he came to power, Erdogan actually leaned on the Kurds against the traditional Turkish Kemalist bourgeoisie. Apparently, the United Nations Security Council is also set to meet to discuss Syria today, at the request of the five European members: Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland. In reality, however, this merely covers for the desire of the PKK leaders to come to an agreement with the bourgeoisie. He criticised the national oppression of the Kurds and opened up talks with the Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan. But this alienated the Turkish ruling class, which sees an existential threat in any potential Kurdish independence and which also has grand imperialist plans for Northern Syrian and Iraq."

      "text":"While he was still in middle school, he added marijuana, Ecstasy and LSD to his mix of drugs. He went to his first rehab programme at a Narconon facility. When he was in his 20s, he started making methamphetamine with a friend who just got out of prison and he quickly became severely addicted to this drug. When he later found OxyContin, he stopped using methamphetamine and returned to his opiate habit. Finally, he began to look for a solution to his addition, because he realised that as long as he was taking the methadone, his confidence in being able to live the life he wanted to live was constantly diminishing, along with his self-respect. He was now a prisoner to the need of finding some kind of opiate every day to keep himself from going into withdrawal. He also continued to abuse morphine and heroin in addition to taking the methadone the clinic gave him. He made a thorough job of working his way through the steps of this rehab programme so he could truly learn how to stay sober once he went home. The older boys he was hanging out with gave him some heroin to snort. Joe enrolled in a methadone programme and stayed on it for seven years. On his graduation, he returned home to Louisiana to resume his life and his job, free at last from any dependence on heroin or other opiates. Joe's Story of Heroin Addiction A co-worker suggested to Joe that he find a methadone clinic where he could get a daily dose of opiate and save him from the need to chase the pills or heroin he needed every day. It's still a bad addiction, the friend said, \"but it will save you money and you won't get arrested.\" This habit would continue for the next seventeen years."

Furthermore, the state veterinary inspection is regularly present and performs additional quality control of raw materials and finished products. Each procedure corresponds to the requirements for reliability, quality and hygiene. In the last year we made a complete reconstruction in accordance with the HASAP system of the slaughterhouse for livestock and cattle and the whole plant for meat processing. The activities in the company are realized by a team of highly trained professionals from multiple profiles, with decades of experience in the meat industry. To achieve a higher quality of products the company is continually improving and upgrading the quality of production in general, especially by buying raw materials from environmentally healthy areas, by consistent installation of modern equipment, and by following the world trends in this area. MIK Sveti Nikole has a lab where regular organoleptic,chemical and bacteriological examinations of the quality of finished products and raw materials are performed daily. For these reasons we have built a treatment plant for waste water, which has positioned our company amongst the environmentally cleanest companies in the state. MIK Sveti Nikole has a storage area for deep freezing of 800 tons of meat and a storage area with a temperature of +4\u00b0C for another 300 tons.

The Super 35mm Canon EOS C300 Mark III incorporates Canon's newly developed 4K DGO sensor, with 4K 120P for incredible slow-motion effects, and can record in Cinema RAW Light for unsurpassed quality. The camera also incorporates Electronic Image Stabilization (IS) in the camera body, supporting 5-axis movement compensation, and a modular customisable design that makes it possible to configure its functionality for a broad range of production needs. Cinema RAW Light is supported in the Canon EOS C200, EOS C300 Mark III and EOS C500 Mark II cameras, in 10-bit or 12-bit depending on the frame rate. Cinema EOS cameras have a base native ISO at which they perform best when recording with Canon Log gamma. The Canon EOS C300 Mark III is able to record up to 16+ stops when using Canon Log 2. The diminutive Canon EOS C200 shoots Cinema RAW Light files for the ultimate in quality and control in post-processing. If you demand low noise and the beautifully shallow depth of field achieved from a full-frame sensor, then the Canon EOS C500 Mark II uses the same compact but durable body as the EOS C300 Mark III but has a 5.9K full-frame CMOS sensor at its heart. Meanwhile the Canon EOS C700 series has top-of-the-line features expected from a traditional cinema camera and is ideal for large crews."

Membership in NATO and EU will benefit the Republic of Macedonia but it will benefit the regional and the Euro- Atlantic associations\" \u2013 underlined the Secretary General of NATO, Mr. Rasmussen This means that beside the fact that we are not member state of NATO, we are taking our responsibilities as if we are full-fledged member, and this is recognised by almost all Member States of the Alliance.

Whether it\u2019s from a dripping tap, a leaky threaded connection or a burst pipe, the cost of water escaping uncontrollably can quickly add up. In creating the RE.GUARD water control system, the polymer expert REHAU has developed a smart solution that minimises risks and offers convenient operation to boot. The wireless signals are also less prone to interference. If a drop in pressure is detected during the measurement, it is a sign of a leak in the pipe system. To ensure that RE.GUARD is always able to detect a drip-based leak, however, it must be fitted downstream of a pressure regulator or a combination of both devices (= domestic water station). The intuitive installation assistant makes fitting RE.GUARD a quick and straightforward process, and it can be up and running in just a few steps. The award-winning system\u2019s quick and independent response helps in the long term to minimise the risk of serious water damage. Z-Wave devices only communicate with one another and with the RE.HUB Gateway. Statistically, water damage occurs in a residential building every 30 seconds in Germany. You can find more information on our website at:www.rehau.de\/re-guard The devices\u2019 short transmission time and low transmission power translate into far lower energy consumption and radiation exposure in comparison to a WLAN solution too. The system evaluates the water pressure when the ball valve is closed, in other words when no water is normally being drawn. This helps in the long term to identify potential savings with respect to consumption. Intuitive installation and central control via an app This means that the devices are protected against direct external hacks and that RE.GUARD can be operated without internet access or a cloud connection. The system is controlled using the RE.GUARD app. The RE.GUARD control system monitors the water flow rate in pipes using ultrasound technology, assessing it in real time."

The Macedonian Euromax resources is owned by two companies with the same name, one of which is located in London, UK, and the other is located on the tenth floor of a skyscraper in Vancouver. The Canadian Euromax resources company owns three companies, its London company and Euromax resources (Macedonia) and a company under the name of Omax International Limited in the Cayman Islands, in the western Caribbean Sea.

Today, the study is available on the website of the company. Today, the study is available on the website of the company. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has subscribed for approximately 20 percent of the ownership of common shares. During a press conference, he stated for reporters that by 2017, the company will have invested 500 million dollars (or approx. 406 million euros according to the exchange rate at the time) in a gold-copper mine. The government website, however, which had published news related to the same event, reported that in addition to investing 500 million dollars, the company was also to employ 500 workers. Environmentalists had long sought for all information regarding the complete technological process that will be conducted in the mine to be published as they feared that the mine could contaminate the near-by artificial lake, used as drinking water by several villages in the Strumica region. As of 2015, Macedonian company Euromax resources had 26 employees, and the value of their non-current assets amounted to 13 million euros. Instead of the study, the Ministry of Environmental Protection released only the non-technical summary, which stated that among other things the company had considered extracting the metals using cyanidation. In the same interview, Sharp stated that the extraction of gold from the mine was expected in 2017 and that the company expects, over the next 20 years, to export ore worth 300 million dollars annually. As of 2015, Macedonian company Euromax resources had 26 employees, and the value of their non-current assets amounted to 13 million euros. Two months later, in February 2015, a representative of Euromax resources, Steve Sharpe, in an interview for Kanal 5 informed that in the next 12-18 months, the investor will invest 20 million dollars for research, prepare a report and present it to the Government in June 2016. In 2016, the number of employees rose to 37. What was problematic with regard to the investment, was that neither the Macedonian Government nor investor Euromax resources had published the environmental study on the future Ilovica gold mine, a document which is to ensure that the open pit would not cause an environmental problem in the region.

      "text":"This already alarming number is even higher across the 47 Council of Europe member states. Equally worrying is that too few of our members treat this crime as seriously as they should, because their legal definitions of rape are not based on lack of consent. The need for a legal definition of rape based on the absence of consent is a recognised international human rights standard in Article 36 of the Council of Europe's Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. Through its monitoring, our Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) has found that many criminal justice systems in Europe maintain force-based definitions of rape. Of those that have been evaluated by GREVIO, only Austria, Montenegro, Portugal and Sweden have amended their criminal codes to define rape as lack of consent. The bad news is that many have yet to amend their legal definitions of rape in line with Article 36. Freedom from rape as based on consent is a most basic human right, which deserves absolute legal clarity to adequately protect and support victims. As we mark International Women's Day, it remains the case that enduring sexism too often determines distorted definitions and implementation of rape-related laws. Frequently, these place the burden on those who have been raped to prove that they \u2013 most often women \u2013 are victims. This must change, and there is a clear route to achieve this. The Secretary General also notes that monitoring by the Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) has found that many criminal justice systems in Europe maintain force-based definitions of rape. These legal definitions often require evidence that the perpetrator used coercion or that the victim failed to fight back.

Therefore, we decided to extend and dedicate part of our 2020 programme \"Contemporary Culture and Cultural Policies\" to reflection on the changing conditions brought about by the actual pandemic situation, which affected our programmes, working conditions, international collaborations, artistic production, production of knowledge, etc. Members of strategic group discussed the procedures of work, organisation, reporting and evaluation of the planned activates, models of communication among the partners and with the collaborators, audience and the media, and development of the plan and time frame of the following activities in the year 2020. Facing these unpredictable times and our already fragile position in society, we found ourselves in need of urgent reflection with our colleagues, partners and friends. On 5th and 6th of February in the European House in Skopje, a seminar was held with the purpose of presenting the new EU program for support of the cultural cooperation in the Western Balkans, organized by the Department of Creative Europe within the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Northern Macedonia. 17 and 18 February were dedicated to the meeting of the strategic group (Transnational project meeting activity), which is responsible for the overall programme and financial coordination of the project.

BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with evidence of systemic oxidative stress, activation of circulating inflammatory cells and increased plasma level of proinflamatory cytokines which include C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is one biomarker of extrapulmonary or systemic consequences of COPD that can be detected. Evaluation of C-Reactive Protein in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease AIM: The aim of this research is to determine whether the level of CRP statistically significantly correlates with the level of bronchial obstruction and the accompanying co-morbidities in patients with COPD. The Student's Independent Samples t-test was used for the statistic analysis of the data. CRP is one biomarker of extrapulmonary or systemic consequences of COPD that can be detected. The Student's Independent Samples t-test was used for the statistic analysis of the data. The classification of COPD patients by the severity of airflow limitation was made according to the actual version of the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). The mean values of CRP statistically significantly correlate with the level of bronchial obstruction and the number of co-morbidities in patients with COPD. We measured the level of CRP in the blood in all of these patients in fasting conditions. BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with evidence of systemic oxidative stress, activation of circulating inflammatory cells and increased plasma level of proinflamatory cytokines which include C-reactive protein (CRP). AIM: The aim of this research is to determine whether the level of CRP statistically significantly correlates with the level of bronchial obstruction and the accompanying co-morbidities in patients with COPD. CONCLUSION: In 52 (65%) of the patients with exacerbation of COPD, were detected an increase of the mean value of CRP. The mean values of CRP statistically significantly correlate with the level of bronchial obstruction and the number of co-morbidities in patients with COPD. The statistical analysis using the Student's t-test showed statistically significant differences in the mean value of CRP in patients with different level of bronchial obstruction. Hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, and CVI were confirmed as co-morbidities in 45 (73.1%) of the patients, hypertension being the most frequent one (40%)."

Based on the literature, all available sources and field research, the exhibition is a visual representation of the fairs in urban and rural areas in the XIX and XX century, defining the time frame of their origin, development and functioning. The exhibition Fairs in urban and rural areas in the XIX and XX century in Ottoman Macedonia, is a testimony to the initial steps of the research done by the Museum in the field of tangible cultural heritage, a project supported by the Ministry of Culture in the field of museum activity, explains the director of the Museum Daniela Nikolova. The exhibition Fairs in Urban and Rural Areas in the XIX and XX Century in Ottoman Macedonia is set in the hall of the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle. During their holding, various festivities were organized where people from other countries were noticed. [sigplus] Critical error: Image gallery folder FAIRS is expected to be a path relative to the image base folder specified in the back-end. Starting from the written historical sources, and ending with the modern experiences, the expostition reflects the development path of the fairs in the rural and urban areas. They represent a cultural core, traders from other countries stayed at the fairs, where the culture of their region was transmitted through mutual contacts. The realisation of the exhibition is in cooperation with Ensemble Macedonia. Fairs as a cultural phenomenon on our territory date back a long time. Most of them were held during the religious holidays, and in addition to the cultural, they were of great economic importance to the people. Exhibition Fairs in Urban and Rural Areas in the XIX and XX Century in Ottoman Macedonia The topic of urban and rural fairs in the XIX and XX century, arose from the need to process that part of the ethnological museum material, which occupies an important place in the traditional material culture in Macedonia. The exhibition can be visited from January 20 to March 1, every day except Monday, by respecting the protocols and measures for protection from Covid. Authors of the exhibition are Darko Trpeski and Vlado Kuzmanovski, museum guides at the NI Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in association with ethnochoreologist Tijana Janevska."

The third chapter gives suggestions on how to communicate with the media and organise CSOs media work. Although this textbook should serve to CSOs in the region as a \"first aid\" and a basic equipment for their media work, it does not pretend to offer a universal recipe or a magical formula, for how to come on the first newspaper pages or among the first minutes of the main television news. When working towards efficient and qualitative media relations, CSOs in the region should rely on creativity, innovation, flexibility, openness and enthusiasm, all of which is already prove by their projects, initiatives, everyday work and efforts. It presents some tools and techniques of media relations \u2013 press release, press conference, interview and media events. It is based on notes prepared for the workshops on Media relations for CSOs held in Tirana (Albania), 8-10 February 2007 and in Novi Sad (Serbia), 1-3 March 2007. Thus, the textbook includes valuable feedbacks, rich experience and illustrative case studies given by the participants of the workshops in the Western Balkan countries.

All participants expressed their satisfaction with the project and the results with hope that there will be other possibilities for similar projects in the future.

It also highlighted the following: Above all, in many countries, the frontline health workers have no adequate preventive equipment such as masks and gloves to protect themselves from infection and prevent the spread of COVID-19. COPASAH is proud to engage and associate with incredible organizations, members and practitioners around the world \u2013 civil society organizations, health care providers including frontline health workers, researchers and academia, professional bodies to mention but few \u2013 concerned with the wellbeing of the vulnerable communities. Barriers in access to testing: Several countries are facing lack of tests, thus they use algorithms in order to determine whether one has a right to be referred for testing in public hospital (free of charge). However, even such persons are either forced to work, or have lost their job. In private health care facilities the tests are often unregulated and are expensive; these need to be effectively regulated Our thoughts are with all of you and with everyone affected by the coronavirus pandemic and\/or involved to contain the pandemic. Coronavirus has exposed the lack of access to basic facilities like water, sanitation to the most vulnerable even to practice basic public health measures of handwashing. Wherever required, available private healthcare resources should also be brought under control of the public health system, to ensure adequate availability of care to all affected persons during the epidemic. 25 March 2020 Dear friends, colleagues and associates, During these troubled times, we bring warm greetings of solidarity to all of you from COPASAH - Community of Practitioners on Accountability and Social Action in Health.

But measures for vulnerable groups, and those working in informal sector (as most of the marginalized groups work in this sector) either are minimal or do not exist. We, as the community of practitioners and defenders of people's health are deeply concerned about the following at this time of crisis: We also call upon all practitioners and civil society defenders of people's health worldwide, to advocate and create awareness so that our governments and health agencies provide the much needed responses to address the challenges of COVID 19 pandemic. 47 per cent of schools lacked a handwashing facility with water and soap affecting 900 million school-age children. Lack of access to protective means for health workers, 25 March 2020 Dear friends, colleagues and associates, During these troubled times, we bring warm greetings of solidarity to all of you from COPASAH - Community of Practitioners on Accountability and Social Action in Health. Insufficient mechanisms to protect the financial hardships faced by many people. You are here: Important news Uncategorised COPASAH Message of Solidarity to Practitioners Worldwide on COVID-19 We call upon all the governments to strengthen the public health system and protect the health of the vulnerable and marginalised communities during this crisis. This COVID 19 Pandemic has challenge the capacity of our already weak and fragile health systems worldwide, thus, we need to step up advocacy by calling on the leaders of our countries to step up overall public health resources while dedicating adequate emergency funds, to ensure that health workers have adequate personal protective equipment, and healthcare facilities have functioning infection prevention and control measures including clean running water and handwashing spots everywhere. In a few places there are certain steps that are taken to protect workers' rights, for example \u2013 pregnant women, parents of minor children, people with certain chronic conditions. We at the COPASAH steering committee and secretariat are inspired and encouraged by all the work of practitioners worldwide in stopping the COVID 19 pandemic, and in ensuring accountability and transparency while carrying on their work. Infringement of people's rights to confidentiality and privacy in some places, due to officials publicising names of COVID 19 patients, contacts or other quarantined persons; this may lead to social ostracism and breakdown of trust in healthcare providers. Nearly three quarters of the people in least developed countries lack basic handwashing facilities at home. You are here: Important news Uncategorised COPASAH Message of Solidarity to Practitioners Worldwide on COVID-19 As practitioners and pro-people advocates all of you are the frontline defenders of marginalised people's health and wellbeing. We express our utmost solidarity with the all vulnerable, disadvantaged and otherwise discriminated and excluded communities, as well as frontline healthcare workers involved in dealing with this pandemic. Also the recent UNICEF FACT SHEET on Handwashing on the 13th of March 2020 has revealed that \"Handwashing with soap, when done correctly, is critical in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but millions of people have no ready access to a place to wash their hands, in total, only 3 out of 5 people worldwide have basic handwashing facilities, according to the latest data.\""

      "text":"There is no trade union where Palestine Jews participate with Arabs in equal terms; there is no common school or hospital; there is no political party in which Jews and Arabs are united (Trotskyists apart) \u2013 even the Jewish and Arab Stalinists operate separately. The imperialists know that whatever the complaint of the Zionist against their master, in no case will they join with the Arab masses. The Zionist leaders, who say the solution of the Jewish question lies in Palestine, really precipitate a terrible new Jewish tragedy. The Left Zionists, Hashomer Hatzair, demand the control of the Jewish Agency over immigration, colonisation and the development of the country. The main leaders of the Zionist movement demand a Jewish state. No immigration and colonisation against the wishes of the Arab masses. The essence of the Crisis, Ha\u2019aretz, October 26, 1945. Imperialist policy was first to pay the Arab workers wages which are far lower than those received by the Jews in the Jewish economy; insofar as it employed Jewish workers, it paid them higher wages. It did all it could to maintain the differences in the standard of life of Jews and Arabs. It is impossible for the Palestinian Jews to save the displaced Jews in Europe by bringing them to Palestine. The situation of the Jews in the Middle East is one of isolation in the midst of a hostile population. Expropriation of the big landowners without compensation and transference of the land to the committees of peasants and agricultural workers. The stronger the activity of the Zionist terror organisations, the greater the isolation of the Jewish toilers from their Arab brethren. This is the result of the criminal imperialist policy of goading the Jewish minority to struggle for a Jewish State, of helping them to erect a closed Zionist economy which turns the anti-imperialist ire of the Arab masses against the Jews. Terrorist activity in Palestine has been revived on a larger scale than formerly, calling the attention of the entire press to the organisations of the Hagana, the Irgun Zvai Leumi, the Stern Gang and their activities. This organisation serves mainly not the class struggle, but the boycott of the Arabs. Their task will be to save themselves from the abyss into which they are being driven. This can be done only by their renunciation of Zionism, by breaking down their isolation in the Middle East, and by extending their hand to the Arab masses who fight against imperialism."

      "text":"Saturday is the most important day of the week \u2013 Sabbath. Another traditional meal is shakshuka, which I mentioned in the beginning. In the summer the beach of Tel Aviv is a wonderful place to spend a relaxing day, lying under the palm trees. Once Jaffa was a really important port and city and it\u2019s not a coincidence that one of the gates to the holy city of Jerusalem is called Jaffa Gate. Jaffa and Napoleon Walking through Jaffa with an organised group is an interesting experience. Our guide explains us that we are passing through one of the gates to the old city and where the fortifications walls stood once. Luckily, the STOP was not so hard to recognise but I had some trouble reading the opening hours of the shops and restaurants. Its construction started in the early 20th century and the central part known as the White City was built mostly in the 1920 and 1930. The construction was influenced by the Bauhaus school in Germany. More.. So I could experience the country both in the winter (which is more like spring there) and in May, when in Israel is already summer. Today the White City is one of the most prestigious and expensive areas in Tel Aviv, which has in the meanwhile turned into a megalopolis. Israel is a state where many different peoples are living together, mostly Jews and Arabs, and the mix between their cultures is inevitable. There are many trees where you can place your towel and enjoy the shadow, if you are nor carrying your own umbrella. I will also try to give some tips about what to see in Tel Aviv and what to do in Tel Aviv, but most of all I will be telling you my story with the city. The White City Tel Aviv is a very new city. It is clean, wide and extremely nice, with many benches and places for rest, overlooking the sea. Dizengoff street But Tel Aviv is a city of contrasts. So just metres away from the White City, you find yourself on the market. Carmel Market in Tel Aviv (Shuk Ha\u2019Carmel) The Carmel Market is located in the immediate vicinity of the promenade and amazes with the contrast to the white and neat city. There are also many cafes and restaurants, if you are not bringing your water or need to drink or eat something else. It is warm like spring, but far from the unbearable summer heat. When it is January and the temperature outside is around 15 degrees, the best idea you could have is to go to the beach, especially if it is -15 in your home country."

Zoran Jovanoski won the second prize for the story Ashes of Death, which was featured on the broadcast \"360 Stepeni\" on Alsat-M Television. Among the 32 stories from 26 authors, all featured in printed, electronic and Internet media, the winning stories were assessed with highest marks by the jury composed of: Marina Tuneva, Arta Tahiri, Lirim Dulovi, Boris Georgievski and Fatmir Aliu. The story, in an authentic and original manner, reveals how in an attempt to enter the EU member states as soon as possible, the citizens perceive the procedure for obtaining Bulgarian passport and citizenship as the way to achieve it.

Marina Tuneva, the chair of the jury, stated that despite the fact that the stories would not have an immediate effect, the tenacity itself with which the truth is expressed would be a great success for the journalists and the newsrooms. Slavica Filipovska won the prize for the best story by young investigative journalist for the story Bulgarian Passport for \"Pure\" Macedonia, which was featured in the broadcast \"360 Stepeni\" on Alsat-M Television. In spite of all this, they are brave and stubbornly committed to doing their job. At the same time, we encourage the editors to support the process of writing investigative pieces, especially when a journalist had discovered corruption related topics and issues that deserve to be treated thoroughly and extensively, Tuneva said.

Slavica Filipovska won the prize for the best story by young investigative journalist for the story Bulgarian Passport for \"Pure\" Macedonia, which was featured in the broadcast \"360 Stepeni\" on Alsat-M Television. The story tackles an environmental disaster, which concurrently relates to the phenomenon of dramatically increased mortality in the area of Kicevo, resulting from the operation of the thermal power station Oslomej and the inappropriate treatment of the combusted carbon ashes. The awards were handed by the Head of the Delegation of the European Union, H.E. Samuel Zbogar, who highlighted that being an investigative journalist all over the world is stressful, difficult and often dangerous. At the same time, we encourage the editors to support the process of writing investigative pieces, especially when a journalist had discovered corruption related topics and issues that deserve to be treated thoroughly and extensively, Tuneva said. Zoran Jovanoski won the second prize for the story Ashes of Death, which was featured on the broadcast \"360 Stepeni\" on Alsat-M Television. The investigative story brings to the fore comprehensive and systematised data concerning the allocation of the 3% of the state Budget on the grounds of crop and livestock production subsidies. Furthermore, it analyses the potential connection between part of the subsidies beneficiaries and the executive branch of the government and the suspicious ownership structure of certain companies which have received subsidies. In view of the fact that the majority of the stories shortlisted were well researched and addressed exceptionally important issues of public concern, the jury gave the maximum number of awards. The winning story was awarded with 4000 euros, whereas the reward for second place and for the best investigative article by a young journalist was 3000 respectively."

A conference fee of \u20ac40 is to be paid on arrival at the conference venue. Within these educational frameworks, learner autonomy is more and more seen as a key to language learning success. By enabling students to choose study modes and methods which suit them, teachers hope to foster a motivational energy which comes with a degree of freedom within the learning process. We invite teachers and graduate students of language subjects in higher education to discuss general and also intercultural challenges and developments related to Learner Autonomy. For SEE University staff, the fee will be \u20ac25 or 1,500 MKD. On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we are pleased to invite you to participate inan international conference on the theme \"Learner Autonomy in Higher Education\". Papers which include an international comparative perspective are particularly welcome. This conference will focus on one selected learning concept: Learner Autonomy in Language Studies. Abstracts should be 150-200 words in length and should include 5 keywords and a short biographical statement. The Conference Programme will include paper presentations, plenary talks and many opportunities for social and professional discussion in an international context. Registration without abstract can be arranged up to 15 November 2013 by e-mailing the conference organisers: m.waldisphuhl@seeu.edu.mkor g.xhaferi@seeu.edu.mk. Paper presentations will be of 20 minutes duration with 5-10 minutes for discussion. Learning autonomy is closely related with other concepts in language education such as: educational psychology, learning styles, cognition, motivation. Call for Papers It is entwined with current teaching and learning methodologies which emphasize active task-based learning and which allow for student initiative and student choice instead of a solely teacher-directed classroom. It impacts upon assessment methods, feedback and error correction. It is also related to new technologies of learning: CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning), learning management systems, blogs and the internet. It includes coffee breaks and one lunch. We invite papers which reflect on the theory and practice of Language Learner Autonomy and which evaluate this concept's relevance to contemporary language education at University level. With the post-Bologna emphasis on lifelong learning, increasingly, students of varying ages can choose their mode of study: full-time or part-time, online studies or different degrees of blended learning and have opportunities to take part in mobility programmes. It emphasizes the diversity and individuality of learning practices both inside and outside the classroom and, fundamentally, it is defined as \"the ability to take charge of one's own learning\" (Holec, 1981). The Conference is organized by the Faculty of Languages, Cultures and Communications at South East European University in Tetovo, Macedonia, in cooperation with the University of Teacher Education in Zug, Switzerland."

Astrology is seen as unscientific and conducive of a view of humans as helpless in the face of natural forces.[11] Amongst the general population, however, astrology is popular, with most major newspapers running astrology columns.[12][13][14] Astronomy is the science that deals with studying the movements of the celestial bodies and reducing observations to mathematical order.

There is no relation between the movements of celestial bodies and what takes place on the Earth.\"[15] It is forbidden because it is based on illusions, not on concrete facts. The Saudi scholar, Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen, said: \"Astrology is a kind of sorcery and fortune-telling. Astrology, on the other hand, is concerned with studying the positions and aspects of celestial bodies in the belief that they have an influence on the course of natural earthly occurrences and human affairs. Astrologists believe that the movements of stars have an influence on people's lives. Most scholars believe that astrology is a prohibited field of study. The Persians also developed a system, by which the difference between the ascendant and each planet of the zodiac was calculated."

The media reported that, according to the company's plans, the Vinica plant would manufacture first-class clothing for the largest BTB \u2013 Comma customer, as well as for its own brand Vayana.

      "text":"Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His last words were: \"On the ground\", in response to his sister-in-law Georgina's request that he lie down. Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His 1859 novel, A Tale of Two Cities, set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers\u2014from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton\u2014for its realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads: \"To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9 June 1870, aged 58 years."

Over the last decade, several buildings have been erected primarily in Switzerland and Germany acting as demonstration projects for the use of VIPs in buildings. A VIP is an insulation material consisting of a porous core material that is evacuated and then sealed into a barrier envelope. Mainly as a result of evacuation, the thermal conductivity of the material in the VIP's core is a factor of 5 to 10 less than that of conventional thermal insulators. After being used in refrigerators and transport containers for quite some time, vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) have recently been introduced to the building sector. Vacuum insulationvpanels thus enable the development of very thin high performance architectural constructions. These design examples demonstrate the potential of VIPs for architectural constructions. Figure 1 Typical example of a vacuum insulation panel with a core of fumes silica and metallised barrier...

From this overview, two panel types, which are based upon C2C principles, will be discussed in more detail: the membrane panel and the membrane panel with stiffening elements. However, in most projects this high performance insulation material replaces conventional thermal insulators, as a consequence of which the potential of vacuum insulation is not exploited to its full extent. In this respect, vacuum insulation panels can thus contribute to a more sustainable and healthy society."

      "text":"In other words, there will be no people (men). I would now dwell on two other symbolisms, the symbolism of the end of the Old Testament and the symbolism of the end of the New Testament. The sick man symbolises all of us today who are spiritually weak (paralytic). This entry was posted by Macedon on Saturday, May 22nd, 2021 at 12:00 and is filed under \u0411ece\u0434\u0438, O\u043f\u0448To, \u041foy\u0447Ho. The most shocking, for me, is the symbolism of the primordial cry of man in search of a real Man and humanity. This is translated into the few words of the Paralytic: \u201cI have no man!\u201d Since Christ was incarnate and identified Himself with us, then there is no reason for despair. He certainly appears in our lives; on countless occasions. \u2013 although we must first restore humanity within ourselves in order to recognise it. Symbolism of the restoration of the spiritual life of the people: an angel of the Lord stirred the water. The Gospel reading of the Sunday of the Paralytic is full of symbolism. They said to him who was cured, \u201cIt is the Sabbath, it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.\u201d But he answered them, \u201cHe who made me well, said to me, \u2018Take up your bed and walk!'\u201d The struggle against every despair and hopelessness, especially in time of sickness, is based, first of all, on true and firm faith, and then on life with hope, which means \u2013 without committing sin. Both symbolisms come down to just a few words: \u201cI have no man.\u201d Thank God, a real man can still be found; but it also means that the Apocalypse absolutely depends on us, on our repentance or unrepentance; on our humanity or inhumanity\u2026 That will be the main feature of the last days, the signs which we see even today. He Himself has said, \u201c\u2026 inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me\u201d. The God-Man Christ visits us in an iconic way many times, mainly through people that suffer. There are also other visits by Him; visits that significantly change our lives. As the symbolism of the true obedience, as the Revelation of the meaning of the Spirit of the word \u2013 in the word of the law. Let us make sure that it is not a permitted illness or misfortune, that is \u201cunwilling visitation\u201d by Him, because of our sins, but let us incite, through a struggle of repentance and obedience, a \u201cwilling visitation\u201d \u2013 as growing through the stages of spiritual development, transfiguration and deification. We see thirty-eight years of patient waiting, in the hope that, eventually, a Man will appear who will lower him into the bath, after the angel has stirred the water.

The main objective of the project is to contribute to changing of the public discourse, underpinned by policies and practices, depicting the Roma as a threat to the visa free travel in Macedonia. The project will provide a baseline analysis of the situation of the practices of returning Macedonian citizens (with a focus on Roma) from the border, identify the ill-defined policies and practices, recommend policy change and raise awareness of the problem of returned Roma from the Macedonian borders. Project duration is 12 months. The European Policy Institute-EPI as a partner of NGO KHAM Delchevo, with financial support from the Roma Initiatives Office, Open Society Foundations in Budapest, in December 2015 has started implementing the project \"Combating barriers for exit: Macedonian Roma at the borders\". Combating barriers for exit: Macedonian Roma at the borders Democracy and Rule of Law: Combating barriers for exit: Macedonian Roma at the borders The project will examine how the visa liberalisation process as an instrument of Europeanisation has resulted in embedding policies that limit the freedom of movement of the Roma in the case of Macedonia."

And she went to enquire of the Lord. 21 And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren. 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. 3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. 25 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: 31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. 4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: 24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 23 And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. 30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. 33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob."

Also published are indices which show the price dynamics according to the final use of the products\/services, classified into 3 groups and 2 subgroups: - intermediate goods except energy, - capital goods, - consumer goods: -- durable goods, -- non-durable goods. Weighting For weighting, the turnover on the non-domestic market from the \"Annual report on industry\" (IND.21), 2015 and the value of exports from the \"Commodity international exchange\", 2015 are used. This coefficient is calculated as a ratio between the average annual index for the year which is used as a new base year, calculated with the new base year, and the average annual index for the same year, calculated with the old base year. Archive of methodological explanations for the news release: Industrial producer price indices on the non-domestic market Status: 21.03.2018 Goals The industrial producer price indices on the non-domestic measure the changes of the industrial producer price levels of the industrial products\/services produced in Macedonia and sold on the non-domestic market. Each individual monthly index calculated with the old base year is multiplied with this rebasing factor and thus adjusted (rebased) to the new base year. Publishing Monthly: - Release \"Industrial producer price indices on the non-domestic market\", - Edition \"Monthly statistical report\", - MAKStat database. Yearly: - Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Macedonia. Harmonisation with EU regulations The methodology for calculation of Industrial Producer Price Indices on the non-domestic market is harmonised with the \"Methodology of short-term business statistics\" by EUROSTAT, for the following variables: - 312 Industrial producer prices on the non-domestic market. The rebasing of the data series calculated with the old base year is performed with a special coefficient which serves as a rebasing factor (Chain factor). The sample covers: -in 2015, 214 enterprises with 533 specified industrial products\/services, -in 2016, 243 enterprises with 548 specified industrial products\/services, -in 2017, 244 enterprises with 546 specified industrial products\/services, -in 2018, 229 enterprises with 525 specified industrial products\/services. The indices cover the sections: - B (Mining and quarrying), - C (Manufacturing). The indices cover the following divisions: - from section B, divisions 07 (Mining of metal ores) and 08 (Other mining and quarrying), - from section C, all divisions except division: 18 (Printing and reproduction of recorded media) 19 (Manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products), 33 (Repair and installation of machinery and equipment). Data collection The prices, which are a basis for calculation of the industrial producer price indices on the non-domestic market, are collected with the statistical questionnaire \"Monthly report on export prices (Industrial producer prices on the non-domestic market\", (C.izvoz). Rebasing The rebasing represents adjustment of the data (indices) calculated with the old base year, to the new base year."

The Spanish ruling party has been reduced to 3 seats in Catalonia and the pro-independence bloc has once again won an overall majority in the Catalan Parliament. The elections have become a battleground to legitimise (or not) a coup by the 1978 regime, in which article 155 of the Spanish constitution was used to dismiss the Catalan government and disband the Catalan parliament. The Catalan elections of 21 December take place in exceptional conditions of repression and limitation of democratic rights. When the Catalan government declared a republic, the Spanish regime answered by sacking it, dismissing the Catalan Parliament and calling fresh elections on 21 December. What is its character and how can it move forward in the face of Spanish state repression? The Spanish state was ready to crush it decisively, while the Catalan government had no plans and no strategy to defend it. That, however, is not the end of the movement. The Catalan elections on 21 December represent a slap in the face for the strategy of the Spanish government: of introducing direct rule to smash the independence movement. The proclamation of the Republic by the Catalan Parliament on October 27th was short-lived."

This has increased with the creation of the President of the European Council under the Treaty of Lisbon.[71] There has also been a greater degree of politicisation within the Commission. Following the College's appointment, the President appoints a number of Vice-Presidents (the High Representative is mandated to be one of them) from among the commissioners. The commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DGs) that can be likened to departments or ministries. For the first time, the European Commission proposed that medical preparedness for CBRN attack threats is a high priority. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed in the field of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Walter Hallstein, the first President of the Commission This is in contrast to the Council of the European Union, which represents governments, the European Parliament, which represents citizens, the Economic and Social Committee, which represents organised civil society, and the Committee of the Regions, which represents local and regional authorities.[1] The European Commission (EC) is the executive branch of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, enforcing EU laws and directing the union's administrative operations.[1] Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg City, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate.[2] The Commissioners are proposed by the Council of the European Union, on the basis of suggestions made by the national governments, and then appointed by the European Council after the approval of the European Parliament. It is common, although not a formal requirement, that the commissioners have previously held senior political positions, such as being a member of the European Parliament or a government minister.[3] Through Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union the commission has several responsibilities: to develop medium-term strategies; to draft legislation and arbitrate in the legislative process; to represent the EU in trade negotiations; to make rules and regulations, for example in competition policy; to draw up the budget of the European Union; and to scrutinise the implementation of the treaties and legislation. Although the institutional crisis was solved the following year, it cost \u00c9tienne Hirsch his presidency of Euratom and later Walter Hallstein the EEC presidency, despite his otherwise being viewed as the most 'dynamic' leader until Jacques Delors.[15] The three bodies, collectively named the European Executives, co-existed until 1 July 1967 when, under the Merger Treaty, they were combined into a single administration under President Jean Rey.[13] Owing to the merger, the Rey Commission saw a temporary increase to 14 members\u2014although subsequent Commissions were reduced back to nine, following the formula of one member for small states and two for larger states.[17] The Rey Commission completed the Community's customs union in 1968, and campaigned for a more powerful, elected, European Parliament.[18] Despite Rey being the first President of the combined communities, Hallstein is seen as the first President of the modern Commission.[13] According to figures published by the Commission, 23,803 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in September 2012. However, the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in 2008 with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner. Only the commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. In the other fields, the Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates on the basis of these proposals. As an integral part of the Directorate-General for Communication, the Spokesperson's Service, in coordination with the Executive Communication Adviser in the President\u2019s Cabinet, supports the President and Commissioners so that they can communicate effectively. [9] Each covers a specific policy area such as agriculture or justice and citizens' rights or internal services such as human resources and translation and is headed by a director-general who is responsible to a commissioner. Under the Treaty of Nice, the first Commission to be appointed after the number of member states reached 27 would have to be reduced to \"less than the number of Member States\". It does this through the member states or through its agencies. Informally, the appointed members of the Commission are known as 'commissioners'. Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the executive power of the EU was held by the council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise."

The State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia hopes that this publication will meet its objective of providing the general public and data users with the basic data on the household income and expenditure in the reference period. We would therefore highly appreciate any remarks or suggestions aimed at improving the publication. The data are systematised for all the households in total and according to the socio-economic category of the household: agricultural, mixed and non-agricultural. The categorisation of households into socio-economic categories provides an insight into the current differences in the level and structure of the household personal consumption, which is a crucial material component of the living standards of the population. The data from this survey are used for drawing up weights for calculation of the Consumer Price Index."

      "text":"On the contrary, it spurred them on to great feats of revolutionary bravery and audacity. It was a nightmare. You have to understand the psychology of the masses. It is a perspective of world revolution, yes. A couple of months ago, the Financial Times wrote the following, and I quote: \u201cA return to austerity would be madness, an invitation to widespread social unrest, if not revolution.\u201d For a long time, it lags behind the objective situation \u2013 that we know. This means that first, the so-called \u201caid\u201d from the E.U. is in fact intended only for the bosses and will actually mean a worsening of the situation for workers. The reformists, particularly the left, actually, have fooled themselves and they\u2019ve tried to fool others. They are wide open to socialist and communist ideas. There is a resistance and a struggle across all of these countries to fight against the attacks on the working class. It was sparked off, as you know, by the brutal police murder of George Floyd. There is a restructuring of society and the economy on a scale not seen in decades. A police precinct in Minneapolis was burned to the ground. But as we\u2019ve seen with the rise of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), this cannot go on much longer. After the Wall Street economic financial crash of 1929, it took several years for mass unemployment to really take a hold of the United States. Like slave society in the past, like feudalism also, the capitalist system now has reached a point of irreversible decline. It reminds me of these monsters, you remember, in the old horror films. In Italy, the communist party played that role very effectively, for decades actually. It\u2019s impossible for the masses to live. It is the third biggest economy in the Eurozone. Hans: Comrades greetings from Germany, the cradle of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, to comrades watching this magnificent session all over the world. A sudden change in the consciousness of the working class. And many people fervently believed that the end of the world had come, that the end of the world was approaching. There is a serious political crisis in Pakistan, there is no political party which represents any section of the masses now. It was the demise of a particular socioeconomic system called feudalism. It shows the enormous power of the working class once it starts to move. The end of history, according to Francis Fukuyama, although I note that Mr. Fukuyama now changed his tune. The more thinking representatives of the ruling class are already coming to the same conclusion as the Marxists. The year 2020 will enter the annals of history as a decisive turning point. The Calvinists actually believed in predestination, that everything was ordained by the will of God, which could not be changed. In this situation, our organization in Italy has not only begun to grow massively and significantly amongst the youth but most importantly among the young workers. These are the ideal conditions for the construction of a revolutionary organization. That is the only thing that\u2019s worth fighting for and sacrificing for in the 21st century. In Pakistan, we can really understand what Lenin said, that capitalism is horror without end. Whether they are judiciary, whether they are district administration, where there\u2019s a parliament that\u2019s become a puppet \u2013 all these are serious crisis of the state. And in the state of its senile decay, capitalism presents a serious threat, not just to civilization, but even to the existence of the human race itself. They say yes, sooner or later we will return to normality. The ruling class of this country is an insult to humanity. Never sufficient. What is required is an organization and a leadership that is capable of showing the way forward, and unfortunately, that is precisely what is lacking in the USA, in Israel, in Britain, in France. Yes, but in and of itself the spontaneous movement of the masses is not sufficient to guarantee the success of the revolution. This was after the crisis of 2008. Yes. Now that is not actually correct, but what is perfectly true is that at the present time, the ruling class of the world has got the government that it deserves, most definitely. Wherever you look, it\u2019s the same story."

      "text":"Gender ideology and the fears of traditional family structures being destroyed are at the forefront of the Istanbul Convention opposition in Czechia too. While most emerging Europe nations do already have frameworks for combating domestic violence, civil sector representatives say that they fail to match up to the standards of the Istanbul Convention. In the final instance, the ratification of the Istanbul Convention is not merely a matter of legal or academic discussion. In Czechia, criticism of the convention came from the linguist and priest Petr Pit'ha. \u201cCzech society is rather traditional and in the last few years especially conservative ideas are increasing in popularity as a part of the broader process of strengthening the European far-right,\u201d she tells Emerging Europe. \u201cThe ratification of the convention would have a symbolic value that in the long term would have the potential of improving the lives of women in Czechia. \u201cThey actually came up with the idea of \u2018gender ideology\u2019 as a way to put pressure on civil society activists and civil society organisations [by claiming] that they act against the state, the church and the traditional family.\u201d She also points out that according to existing data, 32 per cent of women in Czechia have reported some kind of gender-based violence, and that the actual percentage is probably higher given that a great deal of domestic violence goes unreported. \u201cWith the adoption of a declaration calling on parliament not to ratify the Istanbul Convention, Hungary has not only put women and girls at risk but has sent a damaging message to perpetrators that their acts will not be prosecuted,\u201d says Ms Tam\u00e1s-S\u00e1r\u00f3y. Why have so many countries in emerging Europe failed to take action to combat domestic violence? It is also estimated that one billion children aged between two and seventeen years (or half the world\u2019s children) have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence or neglect in the past year. In Bulgaria, ratification of the convention had to be put before the country\u2019s Constitutional Court after it was suggested that it lead to the creation of a \u201cthird gender\u201d and force the legalisation of same-sex marriage. \u201cOpposing of the Istanbul convention is, as in other countries where it has not been ratified, based on ideas that it will bring about a sexless society, where men and women will not exist anymore, the differences between them will be erased and the traditional order will be disrupted,\u201d Ms Kaymak Mina\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1 says. The broader shift towards right wing policies and extolling the importance of traditional notions of gender and family can be seen in how some governments have approached the issue of women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s problems altogether. \u201cGovernment policies and communications have actively promoted the gender stereotyping of women, principally highlighting the role of women in raising children and caring for the family,\u201d says Krisztina Tam\u00e1s-S\u00e1r\u00f3y, explaining the current situation in Hungary. The Constitutional Court ended up rejecting the convention on the grounds that it defines gender as both social and biological category and that as far as the Bulgarian Constitution is concerned, humans are either male or female. While most emerging Europe nations do already have frameworks for combating domestic violence, civil sector representatives say that they fail to match up to the standards of the Istanbul Convention. Unfortunately, more than nine years since a Council of Europe treaty on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention, was opened for signatures in May 2011, a number of states in emerging Europe (as well as a couple outside of the region) have yet to ratify it, amid opposition from right wing political parties, conservative churches, and traditionalist organisations who claim that the convention promotes what is vaguely referred to as \u201cgender ideology\u201d. \u201cThe government has continued to ignore civil society pressure to properly address and tackle violence against women, including domestic violence, and to take preventive measures.\u201d According to Krist\u00fdna Kaymak Mina\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1 from Czech women\u2019s rights organisation Nora, this should be seen in the context of a strengthening of right wing forces across Europe.

It is a missed opportunity for many governments in emerging Europe to shore up the protection they offer women against violence, while also making the institutional response to such violence better and more comprehensive. MAIN DONORS \u201cThe government has continued to ignore civil society pressure to properly address and tackle violence against women, including domestic violence, and to take preventive measures.\u201d The convention would change that, as it requires state actors to collect disaggregated statistical data regarding violence against women and girls. In Czechia, criticism of the convention came from the linguist and priest Petr Pit'ha. That would be especially useful in Hungary and Bulgaria where official data on gender-based violence is nearly non-existent. In the final instance, the ratification of the Istanbul Convention is not merely a matter of legal or academic discussion. \u201cGovernment policies and communications have actively promoted the gender stereotyping of women, principally highlighting the role of women in raising children and caring for the family,\u201d says Krisztina Tam\u00e1s-S\u00e1r\u00f3y, explaining the current situation in Hungary.

While most emerging Europe nations do already have frameworks for combating domestic violence, civil sector representatives say that they fail to match up to the standards of the Istanbul Convention. The convention would also force countries to adopt such measures as sensitivity training for police and social workers, and facilitate better inter-institutional cooperation. This would enable both governments and civil society to gain a better insight into who the victims, and perpetrators, are. \u201cCzech society is rather traditional and in the last few years especially conservative ideas are increasing in popularity as a part of the broader process of strengthening the European far-right,\u201d she tells Emerging Europe. As usual, the Hungarian government\u2019s opposition to the convention was based on vague notions of \u201cgender ideology\u201d.

Gender ideology and the fears of traditional family structures being destroyed are at the forefront of the Istanbul Convention opposition in Czechia too. In all, nine countries in emerging Europe have yet to ratify the convention: Armenia, Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Slovakia and Ukraine, despite protests from women\u2019s rights groups and the broader civil society sector.

In the final instance, the ratification of the Istanbul Convention is not merely a matter of legal or academic discussion. A similar pattern has emerged elsewhere in the region. In Czechia, criticism of the convention came from the linguist and priest Petr Pit'ha. In a sermon in 2018 he proclaimed that \u201cfamilies will be torn apart and destroyed\u201d and \u201chomosexuals will be proclaimed to be a superior ruling class.\u201d According to Krist\u00fdna Kaymak Mina\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1 from Czech women\u2019s rights organisation Nora, this should be seen in the context of a strengthening of right wing forces across Europe. Gender ideology and the fears of traditional family structures being destroyed are at the forefront of the Istanbul Convention opposition in Czechia too. It has real effects on the lives on women. \u201cWith the adoption of a declaration calling on parliament not to ratify the Istanbul Convention, Hungary has not only put women and girls at risk but has sent a damaging message to perpetrators that their acts will not be prosecuted,\u201d says Ms Tam\u00e1s-S\u00e1r\u00f3y. It is a missed opportunity for many governments in emerging Europe to shore up the protection they offer women against violence, while also making the institutional response to such violence better and more comprehensive. \u201cThe government has continued to ignore civil society pressure to properly address and tackle violence against women, including domestic violence, and to take preventive measures.\u201d Unfortunately, more than nine years since a Council of Europe treaty on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention, was opened for signatures in May 2011, a number of states in emerging Europe (as well as a couple outside of the region) have yet to ratify it, amid opposition from right wing political parties, conservative churches, and traditionalist organisations who claim that the convention promotes what is vaguely referred to as \u201cgender ideology\u201d. This is indicative of another problem plaguing the region \u2013 a lack of good data on the rates of domestic and gender-based violence. Why have so many countries in emerging Europe failed to take action to combat domestic violence? Almost one in three women worldwide experience physical and\/or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence by someone else in their lifetime. In a majority of cases, that violence is committed by a partner in their home \u2013 indeed, up to 38 per cent of all murders of women are committed by an intimate partner. In a majority of cases, that violence is committed by a partner in their home \u2013 indeed, up to 38 per cent of all murders of women are committed by an intimate partner. It is also estimated that one billion children aged between two and seventeen years (or half the world\u2019s children) have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence or neglect in the past year.

All we have to do on our behalf is to do His will, in obedience. Put simply, the life here and now, is the life in the God-Man Christ, which contains the future \u2013 the rest of time, the Christian end (of our life) and the Kingdom of Heaven. For example, better conditions for us to be able to pray. Or, we wait for things in our lives to become simpler and easier, so we can take action to improve it. Firstly, in ourselves; in order for some change to happen for the better in the future, and not passively to wait for a better future, and then to make a change within ourselves. Only in this way can we live in peace and repentance and be happy. It is Important to know that whatever we are waiting for will never come unless we change something for the better immediately. Only the harmonised (coordinated) way of life with the level of our spiritual development, as well as with our real position in the Church, portrays the Orthodox spiritual life here and now. Everything else is pride, darkness, fear and unrest in \u201cover there\u201d and \u201csometime in the future\u201d. Consequences of the imagined life \u201cover there\u201d and \u201csometime in the future\u201d are: despair and abandonment of the tangible calling (asceticism), apocalyptic projections in crisis situations, dependence on social networks, failure, ingratitude, dissatisfaction, lack of knowledge, etc\u2026 This entry was posted by Macedon on Tuesday, February 2nd, 2021 at 12:00 and is filed under \u0411ece\u0434\u0438.

Harmonisation with EU regulations The methodology for calculation of Industrial Producer Price Indices on the non-domestic market is harmonised with the \"Methodology of short-term business statistics\" by EUROSTAT, for the following variables: - 312 Industrial producer prices on the non-domestic market. With the transition to providing data via statistical survey, the 2010 price is taken as base price, calculated as an arithmetic average of the monthly prices of the industrial products\/services by month (from administrative source), corrected by the coefficient obtained as the ratio between the price from the statistical survey C.izvoz for December 2014 and the price from the administrative source for the same month. Calculations (1) The monthly industrial producer price indices on the non-domestic market are calculated with the Laspeyres formula. The enterprises fill in data on monthly average prices of the current month and send the completed forms to the SSO, not later than the 15th of the month, for the previous month. VAT is also deducted from the price. Data collection The prices, which are a basis for calculation of the industrial producer price indices on the non-domestic market, starting from January 2015, are collected with the statistical questionnaire \"Monthly report on export prices (Industrial producer prices on the non-domestic market\", (C.izvoz). Each selected product\/service has a code with 10 digits from the Customs Nomenclature and 2 digits for specification of the product\/service, description of the product\/service, unit of measurement, and explanation and detailed specification of the price changes. Archive of methodological explanations for the news release: Industrial producer price indices on the non-domestic market Status: 16.03.2015 Goals The industrial producer price indices on the non-domestic measure the changes of the industrial producer price levels of the industrial products\/services produced in Macedonia and sold on the non-domestic market. The questionnaire C.izvoz is mailed to the enterprises selected in the sample at the beginning of the year.

Data sources The main source of data for statistics on trade according to the economic characteristics of enterprises is the customs declaration (Single Administrative Document) and the Statistical Business Register of the Republic of Macedonia, which is maintained by the State Statistical Office and contains information on business entities (legal and natural persons) and their organisational units that perform an activity on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, irrespective of their size class, organisational (legal) form, institutional sector or sector of activity from the National Classification of Activities where they are distributed by their main activities. Definitions and explanations The linkage of trade statistics with business statistics allows to measure, on the one hand, the contribution of real economic sectors to trading, and on the other hand, to complement business data with detailed information on trade. Number of enterprises is the number of registered legal or natural persons that during the observed year traded goods with other countries and were active at least part of the observed period. Coverage Covered is trade in goods of all enterprises that in the observed period are included in the statistical coverage of external trade statistics for national needs, except the trade performed by natural persons.

Data are shown by the following size classes of enterprises: micro enterprises (0-9 employees), small enterprises (10-49 employees), medium-sized enterprises (50-249 employees) and large enterprises (250 or more employees).

Statistical value of goods - the statistical value on the customs declaration is the full value of the goods at the national border. The statistical value of goods imported or exported after processing is the so-called gross value \u2013 it includes the value of exported\/imported goods (materials) plus the value of the service performed.

      "text":"The North Korean is fundamentally the same. In the aftermath of this defeated uprising, the U.S.-backed South Korean government of Syngman Rhee was able to stabilise the situation, and by 1949, the U.S. had withdrawn most of its forces. In any case for unification to take place on a socialist basis the North would have to undergo political revolution, leaving the planned economy intact (while reasserting state control over those elements of capitalist property relations that the current regime has allowed to develop), but removing the totalitarian bureaucracy and replacing its rule with democratic workers' control along the lines of the soviets in Russia in 1917. The South Korean military is not quite as large, but it is arguably better equipped, and it has the support of thousands of U.S. troops. South Korea is a U.S. sphere of influence and China would not want North Korea to be absorbed by the South. Therefore even on a capitalist basis, there is no sure guarantee that capitalism on both sides of the border would necessarily mean immediate unification. Looking for bargaining leverage in its dealings with the West and Japan, North Korea announced plans earlier this year to test nuclear weapons. After the war, Kim Il-Sung's power in the North was virtually absolute, bolstered by the support of the massive and influential military. According to the DPRK state website, \"The Leaders [Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il] are the sun of the nation and mankind\". In August 1945, the Soviet army had established the \"Soviet Civil Authority\" to govern the North until a local regime friendly to the USSR could be installed. North Korea has carried out an underground nuclear test, attracting the attention of the world media and infuriating the imperialists, in particular George W Bush. The stalling of this project may also be a reflection of the inevitable contradictions within the North Korean bureaucracy, divided over whether, or more likely, how best to open up the country to capitalism. But the problem we are faced with in North Korea is that it is the very bureaucracy of the Kim Jong-Il regime that is endangering what remains of the planned economy. In 1946, Kim Il-Sung became the leader of the North Korean Provisional People's Committee, the precursor to the formal establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK - North Korea), which was founded in 1948. China received advance notice of the test, and proceeded to inform the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. Despite the renewed focus on North Korea, there is little information as to what is really going on inside the country. The United States immediately threatened sanctions to further cripple North Korea's already fragile economy, although how effective these would be without full Chinese cooperation is difficult to judge. In the aftermath of Japan's defeat in the Second World War, the Korean Peninsula was divided in two at the 38th Parallel, with the Soviet Union controlling the North, and the United States controlling the South. Freed from the fetters of capitalist exploitation in the South, and totalitarian bureaucratic ineptitude in the North, the technological and natural resources of the Korean Peninsula would blossom in the hands of the Korean working class. However, the North Korean bureaucracy surely understands the risks involved in this march towards capitalism, which in China took place over decades, and not without significant convulsions, such as the mass 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square. But the bankruptcy of their narrow, nationalist bureaucratic totalitarianism has left them few options. Before and during World War II, the bulk of the country's assets had been owned by the Japanese or their Korean collaborators. We defend the fundamental gain of the North Korean revolution, the state-owned planned economy, in spite of the bureaucratic deformations. Despite the slowdown on this front, there is ample evidence that North Korea has already headed well down the path of China. The North Korean state has also focused some of its investment in capitalist enterprises outside its borders, partnering with companies in China, Russia, Thailand, and Japan (although pressure from the U.S. has severely curtailed economic ties with Japan). And China is not going to provoke the collapse of the North Korean regime. The power behind the old East German regime was the Soviet Union. North Korea depends mainly on China for trade."
